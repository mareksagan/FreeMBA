00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The issues of corporate security are in front of any company in business,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
regardless of what this company does.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These may be financial issues, production issues,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or services, but in any case, security issues are there and they need to be solved.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The construction of corporate security systems is individual,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
depending on the company's features, on the threat,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but there are common approaches to the construction of corporate security systems.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It is built from separate subsystems, which are called information security,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
personnel security, technical security, economic security, and other subsystems.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We will talk about these subsystems and how corporate security systems are built

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in today's seminar.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The topic of our seminar is corporate security, organization and management practices.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The first topic we will discuss today is the general issues of building a corporate security system.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
These are quite general issues, but without them you will not be able to build a corporate security system.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What does a person or a department that deals with corporate security issues usually start with?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The first thing they usually start with is the creation of a document.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The document can be called in different ways, I have encountered different names for this document.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The classic name of this document is the concept of ensuring the company's security.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is a conceptual document, it is quite theoretical, but it is tied to the real company,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to the real threat, to the real object, subject, and so on.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This document is created, it is usually quite voluminous, it is about 30-40 pages.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In a mandatory order, it must be approved by the company's management.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This can be done either through an order or through a confirmation letter.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The next step is to implement this concept.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The implementation of this concept also starts with the creation of some documents.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Basically, these are either programs or plans.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The classic version is a classic plan.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It usually goes for a year, a list of events, responsibilities, money, deadlines, execution date, and so on.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
In order to create this concept, it is necessary to determine some circular stones that exist.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
What do I understand under the circular stones?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I will use this board and write it down.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
These are objects.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The first thing used is the objects.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
What is determined?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
These are security objects.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It is quite difficult to ensure the security of everything that exists.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Therefore, some security objects are usually determined and then their security is carried out.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000
If we take a standard version of the organization, what do they usually understand under the objects?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The first thing is finance.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
In any case, a company has certain financial resources.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It can be cash, cashless money, shares, bonds, and so on.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000
If this money is invested in the wrong place, if it is stolen, then it is clear that a company will have certain problems.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Therefore, finance is usually an object of security.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
To a greater extent, this applies to organizations that work with other people's money.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
To a lesser extent, it applies to companies that work with their own money.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Nevertheless, in almost all companies, financial resources and funds are security objects.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This can be staff.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
In the vast majority of companies, with the exception of a few, people work.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
If these people resign, get sick, get killed, or something happens to them, it is clear that the company will have problems.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Staff also tends to commit some illegal actions, so staff is an object of security.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It can be information resources.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000
There are no companies in business where all information resources are open.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
All existing information resources are open.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
As a rule, all information resources of a company are divided into two large groups.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
These are open information resources and information resources with limited access.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I will tell you more about this in the topic of information security.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Now I will just emphasize that information is an object of security in the vast majority of cases.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It can be material values.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The vast majority of companies have certain material values.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
This can be the case with virtual companies.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
These are warehouses with ready-made products, tables, chairs, cars, buildings, etc.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It is also clear that if this is burned or taken away, then the company will have certain problems.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Basically, everything related to the protection of material values is a security block.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I want to say that in the vast majority of companies, material values are objects of security.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
These can be business processes.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Any business activity consists of business processes.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
This is what the company earns money on.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Basically, business processes are also objects of security.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
This is not only the case with the security unit.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Many companies are engaged in the protection of business processes.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The security service or the employee on the line of corporate security has certain tasks.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
This is the block called economic security, which we will talk about later.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This can be the reputation of the company.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Unfortunately, the technologies of black PR are well developed and well-rounded.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Therefore, the threats that come to the business from the side of black PR are real and must be protected.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Here you can include protection against the misuse of trademarks, if it is a patented brand.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Here you can include protection against fake products, which are also not uncommon in our market.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Therefore, security issues are often crossed out by the protection of the company's reputation.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You can suppress the company in different ways, you can do it economically, legally, illegally, and so on.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
You can do it with the technologies of black PR.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
This is an object of security.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.000
There may be other security objects.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
This is a standard approach to this problem.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It is necessary to assume that each company can define its own security object.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Now, the second round stone that must be determined before the concept of security is formed.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
These are the subjects.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The subject of security.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Who will deal with the security issue?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000
If you determine a huge number of security objects, but do not determine who will deal with them, then it will be pointless.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
In commercial structures, there are several levels of approach to security objects.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
As I said in my opening statement, corporate security issues are in front of any company.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Therefore, in any case, a certain subject must be determined.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
If we take the first level, I call it the bottom level, then this is the management.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Who is engaged in the first level?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
This is the management.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:18.000
In companies where security objects are not determined, the manager decides these issues.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I can't say that this is a good option, because the management has something to do with security issues.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But in some companies, mainly small companies, which do not have a lot of money to spend on security,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
which do not have many threats, this level may be acceptable.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
When the company grows, when the threats intensify, when there is something to lose,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
when there is money to spend on security, then the second level is applied.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I will not write the word level.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
This is a work in partnership.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I call it a work in partnership.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:17.000
That is, a certain official who exists in the company jointly issues a security issue.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
What official should I ask these questions to?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
There are different approaches.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
You can ask this question to some deputy director.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I often came across the head of the legal department, who asked these questions.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
This is a work in partnership.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000
As with any work in partnership, it is not very effective, because it is very difficult to sit on two chairs,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to perform work in two directions at the same time is quite difficult.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Therefore, in cases when there is an opportunity, the third level is applied.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
The third level is a separate position.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
A separate position.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
How this position will be called is not so important.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
You can come across the practice of a security assistant,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
maybe a deputy security director,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000
or maybe just some completely non-speaking position as a consultant or advisor.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The most important thing is that this is a separate position.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
A person who occupies this position solves security issues.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
That is, his main functional duties are to solve security issues.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
It should be noted that one person cannot do serious work.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Therefore, this position is usually an organizing position.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
That is, a person attracts organizations that provide these services in various areas of security.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And this person who occupies this position is responsible for this and coordinates this work.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
This is a very common and widely applied option.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
There are a variety of this option.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I would call it the fourth level.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
This is a security council plus a separate position.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Security council.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Plus a separate position.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
What is a security council?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Usually, it is a kind of advisory body that is formed in an organization according to its positions.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
For example, all the heads of departments of a company are included in this security council.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It can periodically gather once a year, once a month, once a quarter, depending on the need.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It can develop a certain ideology of security, develop a certain direction of activity.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And a person who occupies this separate position will carry out these requirements and decisions that this security council produces.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
This is also a fairly common and effective option.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
There are levels 5 and 6.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The fifth level is the customer service.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
The sixth level is the security service.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:02.000
What are the advantages and disadvantages of the fifth and sixth levels?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
What is customer service?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
In fact, this is a classic outsourcing.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
There are quite a few security holdings that provide these services.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
The company becomes the basis of a certain contract for the maintenance of this holding.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And the security holding solves all the security issues of this company.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
The security service is a structural division of the company.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
There are certain features.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Licensing is required, a charter is required, which is agreed upon by the internal affairs agencies.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
This division is not a legal entity, but the founder of the company in which this security service is created.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Perhaps, the security service is the best option that is possible in commercial structures.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
In what cases do they usually create a security service?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
First, the security service is a fairly expensive enterprise.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Therefore, the security service is necessary when there is a serious threat and when there is money to neutralize these threats.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
The security service is usually created when there are different areas of activity.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I have encountered a security service that consists of one person, one boss.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It seems to me that this is quite pointless.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
It is necessary to create a security service when there are different areas of activity.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It can be a security area, a detective area.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
What is the advantage of the security service?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000
The advantage is that the information and activities of the company on the corporate security line do not go anywhere.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
This is its own division and the information does not go anywhere.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Unlike outsourcing, where the information is initially supposed to be transferred to another organization.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Everything related to corporate security is closed, so it is not always convenient and good.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Outsourcing is a relatively inexpensive event.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
It is much less expensive.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
The disadvantage of outsourcing is that it is closely related to a certain contract.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
The company with this security holding is a contract.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Only within this contract is interaction carried out.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
The security service is its own structural division.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
It can be asked some questions.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
For example, what is the nature of the company?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
What will you never do within the framework of outsourcing?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
The disadvantage of the security service is that it requires a license.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
It requires a consent from the internal affairs agency.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
It requires a certain bureaucracy.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
The inspectors from the licensing and authorization system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will come.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
This is a fairly bureaucratic system.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
But this is a certain officio, this is a certain official relationship, including from the internal affairs agency.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
What to choose?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
The company must decide for itself.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
There are no universal solutions applicable to the entire company.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
It is necessary to look at the situation based on the threat, based on the money, based on the demand for expediency.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
In some cases, it is necessary to create a security service.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
In some cases, it may be limited to either a separate position,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
or the establishment of a subscription service with some security holding.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
This is the second point that you must determine for yourself

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
before creating this concept of security.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000
The next cornerstone that you must determine is the goals and tasks of security.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The goal is the same for all organizations that operate on the security line.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
The goal is the stable functioning of the company.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
As a rule, where the company functions steadily,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
including the well-working security service,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000
where there are problems, some losses on the line of operation of the company,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
including the poorly functioning security service.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
The achievement of this goal is based on different tasks,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
on the solution of different tasks.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
It can be protection of information, it can be protection of business processes,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
depending on the objects that we have determined for ourselves.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000
The goal of the security system

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Now we will move on to the section that explains

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
what the system of corporate security should consist of,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
that is, the structure of corporate security.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I draw it in the form of a wall that encircles the company,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
a wall that holds the circular defense around the company,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
a wall that consists of individual bricks, individual elements.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
These bricks, these elements can be more or less,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
but to some extent they should be present when you build a system,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
namely, a system of corporate security.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
It is clear that if there is not enough brick in the wall,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
there will be a hole, then the construction of this wall will be ineffective.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Therefore, we will draw it as a brick wall in the form of bricks.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
As a rule, when this wall is built,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
one central brick is allocated,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
that is, based on the threat, one large central brick is chosen.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
And around it, the rest of the bricks are built.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
The structure.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000
These bricks that I will draw now,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I draw them for the sake of simplicity of understanding.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Because it is clear that in real life they can find each other,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
they can intersect, they can duplicate each other.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
But nevertheless, the most important thing is that to some extent

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
all these bricks are present in this wall.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
The first brick.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
The first does not mean that it is the most important,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
it will just be the first.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Because in every company, the main brick is naturally its own.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Let's call it information security.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Information security.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000
The term information security is quite fashionable.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
It has been fashionable since 2000,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
when the doctrine was adopted,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
there is such information security of the Russian Federation.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
What is information security?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
It is the state of security of the company's information resources.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
This is the ultimate goal,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
this is the state of security.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
This information security is achieved by a process

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
called information protection.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
What is the complexity of this brick?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
The complexity is that, first of all,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
you need to look at what forms the information takes.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Because information can take many different forms.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
These can be documents,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
which can be on paper,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
they can be on electronic media,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
this can be electronic information.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Information can be in people's heads,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
this is also information that needs to be protected.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Information can be in the form of industrial waste,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
this is also some kind of information that needs to be protected.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
When they start to create this brick,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
which is called information security,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the first thing they do is to determine the information that needs to be protected,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
and the second is to build the forms in which this information can be presented.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And they build protection based on these forms.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
The complexity is that the vast majority of information resources

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
are now in electronic form,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
so to speak, information security has a certain angle,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
which is connected with the protection of information presented in electronic form.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
We will talk in more detail in the section called information security.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
How is it built?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
What directions of building this brick are related to information security?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I will draw it here.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
If the information is presented in the form of material or paper documents,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
and in general in the form of documents,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
then it is necessary to create a confidential production case.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
One of the directions is a confidential production case.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
A confidential production case.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
The second direction is...

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
I have already said that a lot of information resources,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
closed information resources are presented in electronic form.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
The second direction is IT security,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
that is, the protection of information resources presented in electronic form.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
IT security.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Information, protection of information can be organized by measures.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Therefore, the so-called organizational measures are widely used.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Organizational measures.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Or events.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Under the organizational measures,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
this is a fairly large set of events.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
You can even include the restriction of access to information,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
control and access regime in the company, video surveillance.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
These are all some kind of organizational measures of information protection.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
In organizational measures,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
this is the breaking of information into parts.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
These are also organizational measures of protection.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
If you have some information,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
a formula that you want to protect,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
then it is broken into parts,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
let's say, into several parts.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
These parts are territorially divided.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
That is, one part is located in one city,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
the second part is located in another city,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
the third part is located in a third city.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
And different people have access to these parts.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Therefore, the criminal, in order to get all this formula,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
all this information,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
has to collect it from different people

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
and from territorially divided objects.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Which is naturally much more difficult

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
than if this formula was in one place.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
This is a classic division of information into parts,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
a classic organizational principle of protection.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
This was used quite widely before.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And now, if we remember how the secret of Coca-Cola was protected,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
then one of the methods was in the 1920s or 1930s,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
it was an organizational one.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
This formula was really divided into three parts.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Each of these parts had access to only a certain number of people.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Here, the direction is legal measures.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Legal measures.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
In order to create information security,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
this block called information security,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
legal measures can also be applied.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
For example, if you create a commercial secret regime,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
that is, if, having read the law of commercial secrecy,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
you decided to create a commercial secret regime,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
then you must apply some legal measures.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Approval of a list of information,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
creation of certain instructions,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
these are legal measures.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I will stop at technical measures.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
These are technical measures.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Technical measures.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
These are technical measures for the closure of various channels of information leakage.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Basically, this is protection against industrial espionage.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
In order to ensure that information does not go through

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
some technical solutions on technical channels.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And here I would probably add another point.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
These are personnel measures.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Personnel measures.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
That is, information is in people's heads in any case,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
and to conduct some events,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
that is, personnel measures,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
so that people who know your commercial secrets,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
know your classified information,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
so that they do not disclose it.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
This is a whole complex called personnel measures and personnel events.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I will tell you more about them when we talk about personnel security.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
So, the first brick.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
The second brick.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Let's call it personnel security.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Personnel security.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
So, threats, I already said, I will remind you a little more,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
which come from a person.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
There are basically three groups of threats.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
This is the enforcement of illegal actions,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
this is the disclosure of information,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
and this is the enforcement of incompetent actions.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Therefore, basically, all events aimed at personnel security,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
they are divided into three large groups.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
These are measures related to protection

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
from committing illegal actions.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Committing illegal actions.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Well, illegal actions, of course,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
are those actions that violate certain rules of law.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
First of all, these are actions that fall under the articles of the Criminal Code,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
the Administrative Code, the Labor Code, and so on.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
This is protection from disclosure of information.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
From disclosure of information.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
In principle, if you go into detail,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
disclosure of information is a private case of committing illegal actions.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
But in personnel security, this area is distinguished separately,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
simply because it is quite relevant and has a certain specificity.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
This is, of course, disclosure of confidential information,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
that is, information with limited access.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And the third area is protection from incompetent actions.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Protection from incompetent actions.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
This is not really a question of the security service.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
As a rule, protection from incompetent actions

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
does not take part in the security service,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
although sometimes it is involved in this direction.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
The threat coming from this direction is really real,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
because you can build a very powerful,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
very modern, good security system,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
but incompetent people will simply ruin the company,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
and whatever security you build, it will be completely ineffective.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
A little bit about the peculiarity of this brick,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
which is called personnel security.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
First of all, this is the biggest,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
and as a rule the most problematic,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
and the weakest link in the entire security system.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
The vast majority of problems that the company has

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
are related to personnel security.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
There is a certain statistic,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
that according to the disclosure of information,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
about 80-85% of the information,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
the classified information,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
is either used by personnel security,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
or by incorrect documents.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And only about 15% of the information

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
is used by other means,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
like industrial espionage, hackers, and so on.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Why does this happen?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
It is clear, because the use of industrial espionage equipment,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
well, first of all, its use is immediately

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
subject to the corresponding articles of the Criminal Code,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
which is not good for the customer.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And second, the equipment of industrial espionage

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
is quite expensive.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
To get the same information,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
you can use a much simpler,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
more accessible method.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Well, to take the right person to a restaurant,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
to drink vodka, then wine, then beer,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
and get the same information.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Without violating any articles of the Criminal Code.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
We do not take the scrimmage component.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
And this method of obtaining information

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
can be much cheaper

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
than the use of industrial espionage equipment.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Therefore, as a rule, everything related to

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
personnel safety is quite relevant.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
The peculiarity of this brick is that

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
it is quite stable,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
that is, it changes very slowly.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Everything related to personnel safety is psychology.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Psychology of people changes very slowly.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
The methods of influence of one person on another,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
as they were in ancient Rome,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
probably remain the same.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
The same bribery, the same blackmail,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
the same insult.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Maybe some torture left the first place,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
but the second or the third.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
And personnel safety issues

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
are solved approximately the same

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
regardless of what the company does.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
That is, whether it is financers,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
whether it is manufacturers,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
whether it is the service sector,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
personnel safety issues are solved approximately the same.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
But the psychology of people working in different organizations

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
is approximately the same.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Unlike, say, some technical solutions

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
that can change very quickly

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
and which are built individually

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
depending on what kind of company.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
This is personnel safety.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
This is a brick called personnel safety.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
There is a brick,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
let's call it the third brick.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
It is also related to the human factor.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
The third brick is personnel safety.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Personal safety.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Personal safety is mainly applied

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
to the first persons of the company

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
in order for them to work,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
make some decisions.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
These decisions were provided

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
with a certain level of safety.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Basically, everything that concerns

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
personal safety is built in three directions.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
This is physical protection.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Physical protection.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
This is legal protection.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Legal protection.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
This is psychological protection.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Psychological protection.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Legal protection.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Physical protection is the work of bodyguards.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
This is the provision of body safety.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
There are a lot of problems

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
related to the legal side.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Unfortunately, according to our legislation,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
bodyguards work, they exist.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Unfortunately, there are no bodyguards in the legal side.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
When I will talk about the principles

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
and the principle of legality,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
I will talk about it in detail.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Legal protection is the legal provision

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
of decision-making by the company's management.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Basically, this is the work of lawyers.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
If the lawyers have done poorly,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
it is the work of lawyers.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
This is the legal provision

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
of decision-making by the company's first person.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Psychological protection is the work of psychologists.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
This is the psychological provision

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
of decision-making

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
so that people who make decisions

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
make decisions in a state of psychological stability,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
psychological balance,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
so that there is no decision-making

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
in a state of some kind of effect.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Basically, this brick is built

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
in these three directions.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Of course, it can be further painted

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
as some kind of safe food,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
safe swimming and everything else.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
But usually this is not done,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
it is quite expensive.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
And in the best case,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
in the maximum version of commercial structures,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
personal security is built

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
in these three directions.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
The fourth brick

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
is called economic security.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Economic security.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I have already said that economic security

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
is basically the security of business processes

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
that take place in the company.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
This brick is built,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
which is called economic security,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
depending on the business processes.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I also focus on economic security.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Economic security is not only

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
the security service,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
but many departments

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
that are present in the company.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
If we build economic security

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
from the position of the security service,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
then, as a rule,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
this is the business intelligence.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Business intelligence.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
This is the direction

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
of the security service.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
What is business intelligence?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
I will describe it in two words.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
There are different terms.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
There is the concept of business intelligence,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
there is the concept of competitive intelligence,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
there is the concept of corporate intelligence,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
business intelligence.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
In fact, this is information analytics.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
These are two directions.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
This is the collection of information,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
this is its analysis.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
There is an operational direction,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
but in fact, this is information analytics.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
From the point of view of economic risks,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
from the point of view of checking

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
the compatibility of the partner,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
and everything else.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
There is a direction,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
the so-called economic management,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
and the minimization of economic risks.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Management and minimization.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Economic risks.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
This is not always done by the security service,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
although it is attracted to solving this problem.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
For example, to minimize economic risks

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
from the point of view of duplicating

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
some economic processes.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
If there is only one raw material supplier,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
then it is clear that this is an unstable system,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
and from the point of view of security,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
these are risks, these are threats.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
As soon as this supplier is lost,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
the supply of some materials is lost.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
There should be duplication.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Supply duplication,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
supplier duplication,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
consumer duplication, and so on.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
What is the security service doing?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Basically, this is protection against fraud.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Protection against fraud.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Here we are talking about fraud

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
not from the point of view of the company staff,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
but from the point of view of other organizations

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
and fraud from the point of view of other legal entities.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Well, maybe, for example,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
protection against hostile absorption.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Hostile absorption.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
This is also a fairly fashionable term,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
protection against hostile absorption.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
What is hostile absorption?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
This is the control over the company's assets

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
in the face of the company's owner,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
the company's management.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
There are different schemes.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
There are white schemes,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
there are gray schemes,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
there are black schemes.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Security services are involved in solving issues

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
to protect against hostile absorption.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
I draw your attention to the fact that they are involved

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
because many issues are related to lawyers,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
many issues are related to the company's management.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Basically, this is informational work,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
this is a relationship with state bodies,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
including the police,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
to protect against hostile absorption.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
This is physical protection of the building,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
so that the company does not physically gain access

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
to the company's territory, and so on.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Now, in general, protection against hostile absorption

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
is quite relevant,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
although, in my opinion,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
this peak has already passed in Moscow,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
now it is slightly shifting to the regions.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
This is already a secondary redistribution of property on the market.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
This is for economic security.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
There is a direction of technical security.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Basically, technical security,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
these bricks,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
are divided into three large groups,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
into three components.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
This is engineering and technical security,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
this is technical security,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
and this is IT security.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
The fifth brick.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
This is engineering and technical security.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Technical security.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
What is engineering and technical security?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Engineering and technical security,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
in fact, is engineering and technical equipment of the territory.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Depending on the territory,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
depending on the object,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
engineering and technical security

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
is built in different directions.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Although there are some common approaches,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
some common points,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
which are connected with measures.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
I will draw like this, as I usually do.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
This is fire safety.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Fire safety.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
This is relevant for any company,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
because every day something burns down somewhere.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Fire protection,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
fire safety,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
is also one of the components of corporate security.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
At any exhibition,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
at a security technology forum,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
there will be stands dedicated to fire safety.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Here it is clear what needs to be done,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
because there are certain requirements from firefighters,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
these requirements are desirable to be met.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Now there are a lot of measures for fire safety,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
starting with fire paint, doors, stickers, fire extinguishers,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
and so on.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
There are a lot of measures.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
They just need to be implemented.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
There is a video surveillance system.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
The installation of video surveillance systems

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
is an integral part of engineering and technical security.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
The most effective is a combined video surveillance system.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Some video cameras are installed openly,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
some are installed secretly.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
There are some legal issues

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
where video surveillance ends,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
where surveillance as a operational event ends,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
and where surveillance as a security television begins.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
In general, this mechanism is well developed,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
and video surveillance is widely used.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
There are a lot of companies that provide these services.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Here, too, it is clear what needs to be done,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
based on a specific task and a specific goal that you want to achieve.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000
The next area is the control and pass mode.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Control and pass mode.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
It is clear that if outsiders visit your enterprise,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
then you don't have to talk about serious security.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Therefore, the control and pass mode

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
is a component of corporate security

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
and a component of engineering and technical security.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
There are a lot of technical solutions of the control and pass mode.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
These are widely used ASCUT systems,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
automated access control systems.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
They are used when you have a large number of people,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
more than 300-400 people at the enterprise,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
large factories.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
These ASCUT systems are very effective.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
In small companies, where there are few people,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
some simplified manual control and pass modes are used.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
The control and pass mode involves not only the control of people

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
who enter the enterprise,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
but also the creation of zones based on the principle of confidentiality.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
There are some zones in the form of floors,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
where only certain employees can enter.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
It can be for a certain employee,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
it can be for a certain time,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
that is, you can be there for a certain time,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
and you can't be there for a certain time.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
All this is decided by the control and pass mode.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
There is a measure, there is a direction,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
which is called perimeter protection.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Naturally, where these perimeters exist.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
First of all, it is relevant in those enterprises,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
which produce something valuable and useful for employees.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
For example, a meat plant, a liquor and vodka plant.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
The security of the perimeters can be relevant.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Some consulting companies,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
that is, a company that represents the service sector,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
these problems can be put aside and not be so relevant.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
There can be engineering and technical security.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
These are the most diverse alarm systems.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Alarm systems for finding, opening windows, doors, etc.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
There is a very large variety of them.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
In principle, there is a methodological feature.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
The distribution of these alarm systems is given.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Engineering and technical security can be in some other direction.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
It depends on the object.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
This is engineering and technical equipment territory.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
This brick.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And the other two bricks.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
I will also focus on them.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
The sixth brick.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
This is technical security.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Technical security is mainly a protection from information leakage channels.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I talked a little about it in the section on information security.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
But very often this brick is allocated as a separate component.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
From a physical point of view,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
there are three channels of information transmission.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
This is the acoustic channel.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
What is said can be heard.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
This is the visual channel of information leakage.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
What happens can be seen.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
This is the electromagnetic channel of information leakage.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Where there are electrical signals,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
where information is transmitted through electrical signals,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
there is electromagnetic radiation,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
which has a tendency to pass through different barriers.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
It can be recorded.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
This is also like a channel of information leakage.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
The vast majority of the equipment of industrial espionage that exists,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
it uses any of these channels of information leakage.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Therefore, technical security is built on the protection of these three channels of information leakage.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Protection from the acoustic channel of information leakage.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Protection from the visual channel.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:26.000
And protection from PEMIN.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
There is such a term.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
PEMIN is a side electromagnetic radiation.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Now, in general, there are many companies on the market that provide these services.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Basically, they are positioned in the market of information protection.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Companies that, from a technical point of view,

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
not from a personnel point of view, not from a legal point of view,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
but from a technical point of view,

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
protect these channels of information leakage.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
And the last brick on which I will dwell is the seventh brick.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
This is IT security.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
IT security.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
What is the situation?

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Now this brick is gaining more and more popularity and more and more importance.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
What is IT security?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
This is the state of security of the company's information resources presented in electronic form.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
The complexity of this brick.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Firstly, it changes very quickly.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Unlike, for example, personnel security, which I mentioned, it changes very quickly.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Literally every day there are new technical solutions,

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
new threats, new viruses, new protection and everything else.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:55.000
A person who deals with IT security should sit on it every day.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
That is, to do IT security, just by reading a book or going to an exhibition,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
this is unrealistic, this is pointless, unfortunately, no one does this.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Therefore, IT security should be a separate, well-trained person who will constantly do this.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:19.000
The difficulty is that this IT guy who deals with IT security is a thing in itself.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
It is very difficult to understand what he does, to understand an unprepared person.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
There have been cases, this is a serious problem,

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
when if an IT security person is subordinate to the head of the security service,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
then the head of the security service may not understand what the IT security person is doing.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Just because he does not have enough experience, or even education.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Therefore, unfortunately, this is a certain thing in itself.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
There are approaches, personnel approaches to select a specialist in IT security,

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000
organizational approaches, what he can do, what he cannot do.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000
There is an audit of IT security, which is desirable to apply,

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
including for control of its IT security.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Basically, IT security is solved in three directions.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
This is all about network protection.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:24.000
That is, the protection of information resources, which are in the company, in network solutions.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.000
This is the protection of autonomous information resources,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
or information resources presented on autonomous carriers.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Protection of autonomous information.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Protection of information.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:56.000
And this is the protection of information that is transmitted through scattered objects.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
That is, when you need to transmit information from one city to another,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000
using the Internet or some other information systems.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
That is, the protection of information when transmitted between scattered objects.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Protection of information when transmitted.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
What should I pay attention to?

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
If we consider some trends, what is the trend?

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
The information resources of the company are now about 50 to 50.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
50% are presented in material form, in the form of documents, papers.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
And 50% are presented in electronic form.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000
If we take 10 years ago, then basically all information resources were presented on paper,

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
that is, on material carriers.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000
I think that in 10 years the main type of information resources,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
the main type of carriers on which there will be information resources,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
will be electronic.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
That is, everything will be presented in electronic form.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Material carriers will probably be in the form of some archives or duplication.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
If we look at this problem from the point of view of security,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
from the point of view of protection,

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
then what can be predicted and what can be looked at?

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Look at what are the trends.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
If we take some paper document,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
how is it protected?

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
In principle, it is protected only by access protection.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000
The maximum you can do with it is lock it in some safe.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Put an armed guard to the safe.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
All this is in some controlled territory.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
That is, you protect access to this document.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Any security system is initially considered imperfect and imperfect,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
because in any case, all this can be hacked.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
As soon as the safe is hacked and the document is obtained,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
this document is presented in an open form.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
That is, we do not have any secret inscriptions,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
secret ink, disappearing, and so on.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000
They are there, but in everyday life they are usually not used.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000
If we take an electronic carrier,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
that is, some kind of electronic array of information,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.000
then the direction of protection is built on two strategic lines.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
That is, protection is built directly on access,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
in the form of access restrictions,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
in the form of electronic identifiers,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
in the form of some kind of biometric identity recognition systems.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
And the second direction is protection of the document itself.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
What cannot be done with paper.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
The protection of the document itself is mainly done with cryptography,

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
that is, cryptographic means of protection.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
If in a simplified version,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
some information is taken,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
a kilobyte or megabyte of information is divided into 10 parts,

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
all this is done in a very simplified version.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
These parts are re-piled up,

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
the tenth part is on the second,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
the second part is on the fourth,

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
the fourth part is on the first.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Thus, a certain encryption of the document occurs.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
The value of the document is not lost from this.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
That is, it is possible to decrypt in the future,

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
that is, to put these parts in place,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
and the value of the document will be preserved.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
That is, there will be the same document.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
What cannot be done with paper.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
You cannot tear it,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
re-pile it,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
preserving the value of the document.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
This is possible,

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
but the value of the document naturally disappears from this.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Therefore, the direction of protection of information resources

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
presented in the electronic form is more modern,

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
and can be done more perfectly,

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
because it will go in different strategic directions.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000
If we talk about the destruction of documents,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000
if you have 10 volumes of materials that need to be urgently destroyed,

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
and they are presented on paper,

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
then you will not eat them,

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
tear them,

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
and destroy them in a short time.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
If you have the same 10 volumes of materials,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
presented in the electronic form,

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
then you can do it all

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
in a matter of seconds,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
and you will be guaranteed from not being restored.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Even from this point of view,

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
from the point of view of the destruction of documents,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
electronic documents,

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000
they are much more convenient to work with,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
and to a greater extent they can be protected.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
So, the walls and bricks,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
they are already individual,

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
depending on what the company does.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
That is, if you have some kind of factory,

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
which produces something

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
and some waste is poured into the river,

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
then, probably,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
environmental safety issues will be relevant.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
There is some kind of sea port,

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
environmental safety issues

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
could be relevant.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
But, as a rule, in the standard version,

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
these are just the classic bricks,

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
the classic subsystems

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
for the construction of the operating safety system.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Now, at one more point,

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
I would like to draw your attention

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
to the principles that must be observed

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
when organizing

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
the corporate safety system.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000
There are quite a lot of them.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
At some points,

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
I will focus more on the details,

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
at some I will just talk about

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
the fact that they exist.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
But, I say again,

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
the principles are necessary for the implementation.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
The principles.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
The first principle

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
I will probably stop at

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
is the principle of legality.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Legality.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
I will not call for

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
compliance with legality,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
this is not the topic of my seminar.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Just keep in mind

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
that everything you do

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
on the corporate safety line

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
is always clear whether you do it legally

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
or illegally.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The reason is simple and banal.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
The legislation on corporate safety

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
is, unfortunately,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
very imperfect.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The main law on which

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
corporate safety lives

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
is the law on private security

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
and detective activity.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The law that was adopted

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
in 1992,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
that is, before the Constitution was adopted,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
before the law on weapons,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
on the police, on the State Security,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
on security, and so on.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The law was adopted as a transitional law.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It was clear in the early 90s

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
that the state was not able

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
to protect the emerging business.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
It was adopted, I would say,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
quite a political decision

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
that corporate security

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
would be the direction of business.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I note that this is a political decision

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
because the law

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
on the protection of the business

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
is not a political decision.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
For example, in Belarus,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
corporate security

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
does not exist in the form

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
that it exists in Russia.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
It is a state-owned business.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It was decided that

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
corporate security

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
would be the direction of business.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Naturally, it was necessary

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
to create some temporary rules

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
for this business.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And this law was created

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
on the private security

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and detective activity.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
This law was temporary.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It was written on the knee.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Unfortunately, there is nothing

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
more permanent than temporary.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
This law has existed

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
since 1992.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
It has undergone changes,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
but nevertheless it exists.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
In general, we have very few laws

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
that have remained since 1992.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
As a rule, all the legislation

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
in the early 90s has already been rewritten.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Therefore,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
unfortunately,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
the law on corporate security

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
is not perfect

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
from the perspective of the regulatory base.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I have already given examples

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
of bodyguards.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
We have bodyguards.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
There is even such an organization

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
as the National Association of Bodyguards.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But they do not exist.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You can contact the CHOP,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
which provides services

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
for the physical protection of people,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
that is, for the work of bodyguards.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
CHOP will give you bodyguards.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
But do not be surprised

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
that the contract that will be concluded

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
will be concluded on the protection

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
of material values.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
According to our law,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
there is protection of life

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
and health of people,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
but a bodyguard,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
if he is protected

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
by the contract of life and health of a person,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
can only be armed

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
with special means,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
such as a whistle, a baton, and so on.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It is clear that no respected businessman

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
wants his life to be protected

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
by a person with a whistle and a baton.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It is clear and obvious.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Therefore, all the contracts that are concluded

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
are on the protection of material values.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
That is, what is on a person,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
such as a gold chain,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
a watch, a briefcase

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
with documents,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
is located near a person.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
In reality, this is the work of a bodyguard.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Although according to the documents,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
this is the protection of material values.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
It is clear that if, God forbid,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
a bodyguard uses firearms,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
if he kills someone,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
he will have a lot of serious problems.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Therefore,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
unfortunately,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
the legislation is very imperfect.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Many questions arise

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
about the limitation

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
of the termination of

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
operational events,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
where the events

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
that are held by the security service begin.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Can the security service

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
listen to corporate telephone

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and negotiate with employees?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Where is the video surveillance system installed?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Can the video surveillance system

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
be installed in the toilets or not?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
There are a lot of questions,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
including legal ones.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
There are some algorithms,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
some solutions.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But keep in mind

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
that everything you do

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
on the corporate security line

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
is a very thin line

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
between legality and illegality.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
This is in relation to legality.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
The second principle

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
that is desirable to be implemented

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
is the complexity.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Everything you do

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
on the corporate security line

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
must be done in a complex.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Complexity implies

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
ensuring the safety

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
of all objects

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
that you have identified

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and the complexity implies

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
ensuring the security

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
of all objects

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
that you have identified

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and the complexity implies

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
ensuring the safety

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
of all objects.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I have personally encountered

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
a case when a person,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
a company manager,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
installed a cryptographic

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
protection of computer information

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
about 10 years ago.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Nevertheless,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
it was not effective

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
because the documents

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
that he protected

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
with cryptography

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
were printed

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and were lying on the tables,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
under the tables,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
in the garbage bins,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
etc.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It was clear

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
that the principle of complexity

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
was violated.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It was ineffective

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and unwise

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
to install expensive

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
systems of the SCIS

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and the so-called

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
cryptographic protection

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
of the computer information

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
in the database.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Therefore,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
try to apply

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
this principle of complexity.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
There is a principle

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
of temporariness.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The principle of temporariness

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
implies that

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
everything that you do

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
in the field of security

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
should be done

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
in advance.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You should always take

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
one step

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
towards the potential

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
violator.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
There is a saying

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
that it is too late

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
to drink borscht

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
when the kidneys fall off.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
It is very relevant

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
in the field of security.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
As soon as something

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
happens,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
you start thinking

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
about it.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It is based on experience.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Unfortunately,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
it is not always

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
the case.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
The principle of temporariness

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
implies that

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
everything that you do

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
in the field of security

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
should be done

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
in advance.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
There is a saying

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
that it is too late

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
to drink borscht

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
when the kidneys fall off.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Unfortunately,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
it is not always the case.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The next principle

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I would like to point out

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
is the principle of temporariness.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The principle of temporariness

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
implies that

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
everything that you do

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
in the field of security

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
should be done

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
in advance.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
If we say that bodyguards

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
guard the body for 20 minutes,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and then drink

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
beer for 20 minutes,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
then we do not have to

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
guard this person.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
If this person

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
is guarded for 8 hours

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
at work,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and then he goes to the next yard

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
to take out the garbage in his slippers,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
then we do not have to

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
guard this person.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Therefore, everything that will be done

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
in the field of corporate security

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
should be done in advance.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
As a rule, the principle of temporariness

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
or the problems with the principle of temporariness

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
or the breakdown of this principle

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
are associated with a human factor.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
There is a guard

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
in the face,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
for example,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
the head of the security service.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
When this head of the security service

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
goes around, checks everything,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
the system works.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
The head of the security service

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
leaves,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
goes to a seminar,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
the system starts to malfunction.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
The principle of temporariness

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
can be violated in the time factor.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
During the day, everything works well,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
at night, when there is no one,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
everything can work badly.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It can be violated by a natural factor.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
On the street, let's say, 0 degrees,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
everything works well,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
on the street, minus 30,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
everything starts to work badly

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
and the equipment fails.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
The principle of corporative security

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
is based on this.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Everything you do should work continuously.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
There is a principle of activity.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I will not dwell on it.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
There is a famous saying

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
that the best defense

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
is an attack.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Therefore,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
it is about

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
everything you do

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
in the case of corporate security,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
it should be done actively.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
The principle of systematic plannedness

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
says that you should create

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
a system.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
There should not be

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
individual elements of corporate security,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
but a system of corporate security.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Everything that is done

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
in the line of corporate security

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
should be done in a certain way.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
There is a very relevant

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
and problematic principle

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
related to the principle of purposefulness.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
The principle of purposefulness

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
assumes that

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
the money you invest

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
in the system of corporate security

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
will not allow you

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
to make a profit.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
The management of the company

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
understands this very clearly.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You have a profit.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
If you invest

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
in the development of the production,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
it will allow you to make a profit.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
If you invest

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
in security,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
you will not make a profit.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You can only get protection

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
from losses.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Therefore,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
losses that can be made

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
if you do not spend

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
money on security are always considered.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
When the question arises

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
how much money to spend on security,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
it is always based on losses.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
If the loss is equal to 100 rubles,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
it makes no sense to spend

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
1000 rubles on security.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
This is often the case.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I gave an example

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
of a store.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You can reduce the theft

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
to a very small amount,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
but the money you invest

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
in the development of the equipment

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
will be economically ineffective.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The losses will be much less

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
than the money you will spend

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
on the technical equipment

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
of the store.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
There is a principle

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
that is widely used in security.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
This is the duplication principle.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
The duplication principle.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Let's recall an old joke.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Then it turned into a plot from Yarolash.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
When a little boy

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
was asked to buy two tickets,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
his grandmother asked him

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
why he was buying two tickets.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
He said that he would go to the controller

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and lose one ticket.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
He would have a second ticket.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The grandmother asked him

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
if he would lose a second ticket.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
He replied that he had a production ticket.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It is right to understand

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
that some critical things

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
must be duplicated.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
This makes the system expensive.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
The system with duplicated subsystems

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
is more expensive,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
but in some critical

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
important things

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
it justifies it.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
If we take a space industry,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
there is duplication

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
up to 5-7 times.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Up to 5-7 blocks

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
can take on functions

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
of some other blocks.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Just because it is space,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
you can't send

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
a block or a part there.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
The duplication principle

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
is widely applied

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
in corporate security.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
For example, in IT security

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
it is necessary to duplicate

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
information resources,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
create backups, etc.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
In the technical direction

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
it is also widely applied.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
For example, the communication system,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
the main reserve channel,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
some fire safety sensors,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
the main one for smoke and heat,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
it is widely applied.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
We often face

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
the question of

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
duplication of information resources.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It is clear that

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
if there is a fire,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
all information resources are destroyed,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
then the company faces

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
a big problem

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
if there is no duplication system.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
There are different algorithms.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It can be a remote server

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
or a bank cell,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
or some other options.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The main thing is

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
that the duplicated information resources

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
are not near the main server.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
If there is a fire,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
it destroys

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
the main information resources.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
The duplication principle

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
is widely applied

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
in all aspects

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
of corporate security.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
The specialization principle

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
is quite simple.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
You can do some things

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
in the corporate security

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
by yourself,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
by reading books,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
by attending seminars.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Some aspects

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
of corporate security

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
should be trusted

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
to the specialists,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to the narrow specialists

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
of your field.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
The specialization principle

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
is about

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
IT security.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I have already mentioned it.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
There should be a specialist

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
who is working on it every day.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You can search

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
for industrial espionage equipment

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
in your office

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
by yourself

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
by buying some non-linear locators.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I would not recommend

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
doing it

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
because the equipment

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
is quite expensive.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You can search

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
for industrial espionage equipment

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
by yourself.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
You can work on it

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
by yourself.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You can buy

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
some equipment

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
by yourself.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It is better to use

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
the services of the specialists

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
in these things.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
However, some things

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
can be done by yourself

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
in the corporate security.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
There is a concept

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
of interaction and coordination.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
This is the principle.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Interaction

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and coordination.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
First of all,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
this principle

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
applies to the security services.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
The security services

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
should coordinate

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
their activities.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It is related to the interaction

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
of the security services

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
with the security services

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
of the police.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
They have to

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
interact with each other.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
There is a certain

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
relationship

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
between the security services

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
and the internal affairs.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
This principle

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
applies

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
to the interaction

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
of the security services

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
and other companies.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
This is the principle

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
of interaction and coordination.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
There is another interesting principle.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I will talk about it.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
It is the principle of improvement.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Improvement.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
What does

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
this principle say?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
The corporate security system

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that you have created

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
should be checked

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
from the point of view

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
of improvement.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
First of all,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
it applies to two aspects.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The first one is

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
the technical aspects.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Technical issues.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The second one is

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
the threats.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
The technical issues.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
You can equip

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
your office, your department,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
your company

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
with the latest technology

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
in the field of corporate security.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
In a year or a year and a half,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
you will find out

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
that all this has become

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
hopelessly outdated

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
and you need to change it.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
The technology is moving

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
very fast.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
There was analog television,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
now there is digital.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
There was one resolution,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
now there is another.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
The technical means of attack

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
and the security of IT

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
are changing very fast.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Something new happens

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
almost every day.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Every month,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
new products are released.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
The principle of improvement

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
is checked from the point of view

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
of technical issues.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It also needs to be prepared

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
by the management.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Not every manager understands

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
why he has to spend money

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
on technical reequipment.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It happens very fast.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And the improvement

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
is from the point of view of threats.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
As I said,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
the protection is built

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
on the basis of real threats.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The threats can change.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The corporate security system

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
needs to be improved

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
from the point of view of the threats.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
For example,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
to make it clear,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
a control-missile regime

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
is created in the company.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
The threat is determined

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
by the threat.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
What kind of threat?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It can be a threat

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
from a hooligan

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
or a drunk person

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
who wants to enter the facility.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It is clear.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The protection system

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
is built on the basis of these threats.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
If the threats are different,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
for example,

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
you defend yourself

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
from a terrorist

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
and you have to build

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
a completely different control-missile regime.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Because the first option

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
will not be effective.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
The improvement from the point of view of threats

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
is not necessarily

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
an increase in the system.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It can be a certain weakening of the system.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
If the threats are gone,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
there is no point in spending a lot of money

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
on security.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
The improvement from the point of view of threats

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
can be a weakening of the system.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
There is a principle

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
that is also quite interesting.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It is the centralization of the control.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
The principle of centralization

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
of the control.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
What does it mean?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
The system of corporate security

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
should be subordinate to someone

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
and close to someone.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
The strict rule and strict requirement

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
is the subordination

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
of the security department

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
to the first person of the company.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
It can be the general director,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
the owner of the company,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
or someone else.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
But in no case is security

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
subordinated to top managers,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
to other departments

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
or not to the first person of the company.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
The difficult question

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
arises when

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
the owner of the company,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
the owner of the company,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
the owner of the company

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
and the general director

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
are different people.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Who should the security department

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
close to?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
There are no ready-made final decisions here,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
because the question is quite slippery.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
In the vast majority of cases,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
the security department's chief

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
subordinates to the company's owner

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
in strategic matters,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and the general director

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
in current matters.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Why is there such a division?

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Because the company's owner

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
can set tasks for the security department

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
in relation to certain control

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
or certain actions

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
in relation to the general director.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
For example,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
the general director

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
is also a hired person.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Although the question is very slippery,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
it is solved in different ways.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
There are no ready-made solutions here.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
There are several principles

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
related to the human factor.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
The principle of minimizing

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
the use of the human factor.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Minimizing

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
the use

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
of

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
the human factor.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
From the point of view of security,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I have already said that the weakest link

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
is the human factor.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Therefore, as soon as the security system

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
is strongly tied to the human factor,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
it is always bad.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Therefore, they try to make

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
the system not tied to the human factor.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
This is also related to the leadership

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
of the security service.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
The system should not be tied

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
to a specific head of the security service.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
This is related to some technical solutions,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
to some other solutions,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
so that as few questions as possible

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
are closed on the human factor.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
The technique is clear,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
predictable,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
logical,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
and predictable.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
A person is usually not logical,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
unpredictable,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
and unpredictable.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
There are also many ways

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
to influence a person.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Therefore, everything that is tied

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
to the human factor is the weakest link.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
There is a very interesting principle.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
There is such a concept as the golden section of security.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
The golden section of security.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
What is it?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Usually, it is drawn in the form of a triangle,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
where there are such parameters as

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
price,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
speed,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and security in the corners.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
When these three parameters are analyzed,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
it is necessary to assume that

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
you will not be able to choose

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
all three parameters at the same time.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Usually, they choose

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
some two priority parameters.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
You can make the system safe

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
and make it cheap,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
but it will take a long time to create.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You can make the system safe,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
you can make the system fast,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
but it will be very expensive.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
You can make the system fast,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
but it will be very expensive.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
You can make the system cheap,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
you can make it fast,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
but it will be unsafe.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Therefore, initially,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
when this system of corporate security is created,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
they try to determine

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
these three parameters.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Somewhere, let's say,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
some priority parameters are chosen.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Two priority parameters

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
are chosen from these three.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Here, this golden section

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
is, of course,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
individual for each company.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
That is, for each company

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
some two priority parameters are given.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
The main ones must be chosen,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
and the rest must be sacrificed.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
There are several more principles

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
that are applied.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
is also related to the human factor.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
is also related to the human factor.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
is clear.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Here I would pay attention

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
not so much to the severity of the punishment,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
if we are talking about responsibility,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
but to the inviolability of the punishment.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
That is, people should know

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
that for committing some illegal actions

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
they are waiting for punishment.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
As a rule,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
observing the formation

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
of the corporate security system,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I can say that

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
the formation of all corporate security systems

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
is usually carried out

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
through some kind of punishment.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
That is,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
corporate security systems are created,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
and usually after that

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
there is a certain rejection

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
from the employees of the company.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Because any security

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
is a certain restriction

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
of the employee's authority,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
a certain complication

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
of their life at work, and so on.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
After that,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
people begin to be outraged,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
people begin to not fulfill

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
the requirements that the security system

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
builds.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
People are first convinced,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
then, as a rule,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
punished because the conviction

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
in most cases is inactive.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And in the future,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
the system will start working.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
That is, it goes through punishment.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
In relation to personal responsibility,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
such demonstrative events are widely used,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
starting with public punishments,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
ending with public,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
so to speak,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
attraction to responsibility,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
including criminal responsibility,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
and the consequences associated

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
with this.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That is,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
when people understand

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
that for, say,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
violation of some rules,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
for committing an action

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
that falls under the Criminal Code,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
the court can bring to justice,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
this is a fairly effective thing.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Then, as a rule,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
people behave very calmly and quietly.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
The next point

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
is

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
the principle of restriction of authority.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
The principle of restriction of authority.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I have already mentioned

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
the principle of restriction of authority.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
In the classical version,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
people should have access

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
only to the information

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
they need

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
to perform their work,

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
and should have

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
small powers,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
and there should be maximum control.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
The problem is mainly when

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
the powers are maximum,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
and the control is minimal.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
When the system is built

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
to the maximum,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
the problem does not arise.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
There are a few more principles

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
that are quite important.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
The principle of multilaterality.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
What does this principle say?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
It says that

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
any security system

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
does not guarantee

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
100% security.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Any security line

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
can be overcome.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It's just about time,

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
money, expediency, etc.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
The more security lines there are,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
the more reliable

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
the system is.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
For example,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
the security line

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
is used in security events.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
If you have a separate room

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
and you need to provide

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
security for this room

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
in some building,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
then here you can

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
create only one security line.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
There are bars,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
metal doors on the windows,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
a man with a gun,

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
and so on.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
If you have a separate mansion

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
with adjacent territory,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
security events

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
are usually built

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
according to the ring principle.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
There is a perimeter

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
that guards the dogs,

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
sensors,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
alarm systems, etc.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
There is a second security line,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
for example,

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
a building with metal doors,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
bars, etc.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
There is a third security line,

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
which is the security of the floor.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
The fourth security line

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
is the security of the room.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
It is a classic multi-border

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
security principle.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
In IT security,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
the multi-border principle

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
is widely used.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
For example,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
you need to enter a password

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
to enter a computer,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
to enter an information system,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
you need to show

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
some electronic identifiers,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
to enter a particularly

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
classified file,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
to make your fingerprint,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
or an iris of the eye,

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
or something else.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
This is also a classic multi-border

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
security principle.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
There is a principle

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
that is often violated,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
it is the principle of equality.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
The principle of equality

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
says that the system

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
of security

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
is determined

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
by the strength

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
of the least protected element.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
If you have 10 windows

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
in a simplified version,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
you put a very powerful

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
grill on 9 windows,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
and on the 10th window

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
there is no grill at all,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
then the strength of these 9 grills

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
will be absolutely pointless

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and useless, because the criminal

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
will climb into this 10th window.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
In practice, this is very common,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
when there are very powerful

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
security peaks in this system,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
and there are some holes

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
through which the criminal

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
can easily penetrate.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Remember one of the strict

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
security rules,

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
the strength of the security system

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
is generally estimated

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
by the strength of the

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
least protected element.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
In life, you often encounter this.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
There are two more principles,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I will draw them here.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
There is a principle of psychological

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
impact on the offender.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
What is it about?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
By the way, this is a very cheap

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
implementation principle,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
you go to the store very often,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
you see a sticker,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
the object is guarded by the police,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
it is difficult to say

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
whether it is guarded or not,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
but it protects you from some

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
levels of threat.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Attention is being filmed by a hidden

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
video camera in stores,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
there are also such stickers.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
What is it?

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
These stickers pursue different

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
purposes, including a certain

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
psychological impact.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
If you put these stickers on,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
all your problems will be solved,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
at least it will protect you

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
from some levels of threat.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
At the household level,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
you often encounter this,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
you walk along the country side,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
you see a sign that

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
there is an angry dog in the yard.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
This is a psychological impact

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
on a potential offender.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
It is advisable not to overdo it,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
because sometimes,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
for example, stickers are placed

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and the alarm is set,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
and it determines the brand.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
For example, Clifford,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Alligator, and so on.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
It is pointless to talk about

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
the specific model of the alarm

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
installed on this car,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
because the attackers know

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
all these systems,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
the anti-theft system,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
and it is pointless to inform them

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
in advance what is installed there.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Nevertheless, the principle of psychological

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
impact is widely used

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
and it works very well.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You can install a video camera

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
on your object,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
so that it can be seen.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And surprisingly,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
you will find that

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
the number of people

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
who want to climb over

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
this fence will sharply decrease

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
due to the psychological impact.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Sometimes documents are made

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
in such a way

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
to apply this principle

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
to the psychological impact.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
There is a mode of commercial secrecy.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
If you want to create it,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
you need to make sure

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
that the employees take on

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
the obligation to keep

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
your commercial secrets.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
This obligation can be

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
either through a labor agreement

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
where a separate record is made,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
or through a separate agreement

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
or a separate agreement.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
A separate agreement

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
is more effective,

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
both psychologically and

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
through psychological impact.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
When a person reads

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and sees that the articles

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
of the Criminal Code,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Administrative Code,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Labor Code,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
are flashing,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
this is much more effective

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
from the psychological point of view

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
than just a simple phrase

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
in a labor agreement.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Therefore, pay attention

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
to the psychological impact

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
of the law.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
There is a principle

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
of combining

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
publicity and conspiracy.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
This is the last principle

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I will talk about.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
It is about

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
everything you do

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
in the corporate security line

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
is usually divided into

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
two large groups.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
The first is

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
an open event,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
that is, you do not hide

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
what is happening.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
The second is a hidden event.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Hiding everything

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
that is done in the corporate security line

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
is unrealistic,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
it is pointless and expensive.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Therefore, everything is divided

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
into two large groups.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
In particular,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
some checks

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
that are carried out in companies

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
are usually divided into two groups.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
These are open checks

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
and hidden checks.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
There are planned checks,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
check of the confidential

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
business of production,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
everyone can know that

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
a check will come.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
There are unplanned checks,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
but they are not determined.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Unplanned checks

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
are like a sword

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
that hangs over a person

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
and he knows that

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
some of the things

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
he has to do

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
can always be checked

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
in the security line.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Unplanned checks

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
usually show the true

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
position of the case.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Planned checks are more

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
from the point of view

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
of the organization,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
and unplanned checks are more

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
from the point of view of real control.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
These are the principles.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
What do you think about the

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
construction of a corporate security system?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
What do you think about the

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
construction of a corporate security system?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I would like to finish

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
the first topic

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
about the construction

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
of a corporate security system.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I would like to

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
pay attention to

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
the following points.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
The security system

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
is effective

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
when a pyramid is built.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I mean a barricade.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
On the one hand,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
there is a personnel,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
security service workers,

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
management of the company.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
On the other hand,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
there are potential

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
violations of the barricade.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
When there is a barricade,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
the system is built effectively.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
In practice,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
such a rigid barricade

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
does not usually arise.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
There is usually

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
some incomprehensible figure,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
where the personnel is on one side,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
the security service is on the other side,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
the management of the company

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
is on the third side,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
and the potential violator

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
is generally unknown.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
There should always be

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
some ideal that you need to strive for.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
This ideal is precisely

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
the barricade I am talking about.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
The second point

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
that you will face

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
and usually face

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
when building a corporate security system

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
is

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
how to assess

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
the effectiveness

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
of corporate security.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
What is it about?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
It is about

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
professionally competent

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
work of the security service

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
and the fact

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
that it is not visible.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
All the problems

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
that arise

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
are solved at the stage of birth.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Therefore,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
nothing happens around the company.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
But when nothing happens,

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
the question arises

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
why nothing happens.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Either because nothing happens

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
or because the security service

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
works competently.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Many managers

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
start asking

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
why they should not

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
work in the security service

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
if nothing happens.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Therefore,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
security service often has problems

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
with assessing its activity

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
and its effectiveness.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Security service often

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
conducts such demonstrations.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It is necessary to catch someone

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
and show their importance.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
But professional security service

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
does not work.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Nothing happens around.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
What is the most difficult

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
thing when building

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
a corporate security system?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
In my opinion,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
it is the analyst.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
It is necessary to create

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
an information-analytical unit

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
that will get the information

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
and analyze it.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
It is difficult to find

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
analysts in the corporate security line.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
There are not many of them.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
They are not prepared anywhere.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
It requires

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
a certain experience

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
and an analytical mind.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
The result of the work

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
from the information-analytical unit

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
can be obtained only after a while.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Usually,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
after at least a few months

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
after the creation

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
of the information-analytical unit,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
you can expect some result.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Unlike security services,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
where the result

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
can happen the next day

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
or an hour

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
after the security service was established.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
You will face this problem.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
There is a concept

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
of work on demonstration events

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
and work on the result.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
What I want to say

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
is that

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
sometimes security is a fashion.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
You often face it.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
It is a fashion

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
and a fashion type of activity.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
It is a fashion

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and a fashion type of activity.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Security services

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
build their work

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
not from the point of view of efficiency,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
but from the point of view of certain fashion directions.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
When you see

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
bodyguards

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
driving in a car

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and in front of them

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
a bodyguard

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
is driving in an open convertible

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
in Moscow,

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
stopping at every traffic light,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
from the point of view of human protection,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
it is pointless.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
But it is a demonstration event.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
A person likes

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
a car with a bodyguard.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Although

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
it cannot be effective

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
because

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
there is no real protection.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
A lot of

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
security

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
is created

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
from a certain

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
how to say

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
from a certain image.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
A competitor has

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
a bodyguard

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
and a company manager

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
creates security

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
and a company manager

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
creates security

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
from the point of view

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
that a competitor has it,

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
so it should be mine.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Look from this point of view

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
how you need to create a security unit

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
and how it will work

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
from the point of view of efficiency

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
or from the point of view

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
of efficiency.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I would like to emphasize

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
that all the questions

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
that you will solve

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
in the line of corporate security

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
should be divided into two big groups.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The one where it is clear what needs to be done

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
and the one where it is not clear what needs to be done.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
The one where it is clear what needs to be done

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I would say

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
is mainly technical issues.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
You need to install

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
a video surveillance system.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
In general, it is clear what needs to be done.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
You need to look at

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
what cameras,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
choose a company

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
that will install it,

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
serve it, and so on.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
You need to allocate money for it.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
There are problems where it is not clear what needs to be done.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
As a rule, it is a relationship

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
with the controlling law enforcement agencies,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
it is business intelligence,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
it is personnel security.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
And here,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
at those moments

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
when it is not clear what needs to be done,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
the law enforcement agencies pay more attention to it.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I think that is all

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
about our first topic

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
on building corporate security systems.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:57.000


01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:03.000
The next topic we will discuss today is the personnel safety of the company.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:10.000
As I said, personnel safety of the company is generally very weak.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
In general, everything that concerns the human factor is the weakest link in the corporate security system.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000
We are considering the issues that we will discuss today.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:27.000
These are the threats that the company faces from the human factor.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000
These are the options for implementing these threats.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:39.000
As I said in the first part, there are threats and options for implementing these threats.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Let's talk about personnel safety.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Let's talk about the procedure of hiring employees,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:04.000
the procedure of firing employees in terms of personnel safety.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And let's talk about the use of polygraphs in the testing of employees.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:27.000
The first question is the threats to the interests of the company applied to the human factor.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Basically, the threats to the interests of the company applied to the human factor are three basic threats.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000
These are all the threats to the actions of the law enforcement officers,

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:52.000
actions that fall under the criminal code or the administrative code.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000
These can be theft, fraud, or other actions.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:07.000
The second basic threat is the disclosure of secrets by the law enforcement.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:19.000
This can be the disclosure of commercial secrets, personal data, professional secrets in the form of medical, notarial, etc.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Everything that concerns the disclosure of information.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:31.000
The third basic threat is the implementation of incompetent actions.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000
They can be legal, but they are simply incompetent and can damage the company's interests.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Let's consider the issue of information leakage,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:02.000
the disclosure of information as a threat.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
What are the possible ways to implement this threat?

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
There are several options.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:24.000
First, through the employees of the company.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:39.000
People work in the company, and they can disclose the information that has become known to them in the framework of their work.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:54.000
This can be done through an employee.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:04.000
A person is employed in the company to disclose information or to commit illegal actions.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
The goal is not fundamental.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
A person is employed to commit illegal actions.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000
This is not a unique thing.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:23.000
The organization can be implemented by competitors or by organizations.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
This is a channel of information disclosure.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:40.000
The channel of information disclosure is through the fired employees.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
People are fired from the organization.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
This is a normal process.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:52.000
We have a labor code that states that any employee can file a complaint about leaving on their own will,

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
and then be free to work for a maximum of two weeks.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:06.000
It is difficult to say that an employee will not disclose any confidential information that has become known to him at work.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:29.000
It is difficult to say that an employee will not disclose any confidential information that has become known to him at work.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.000
The legal practice states that such cases are almost unique and difficult to implement.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Therefore, a large threat is posed by the fired employees, because a large channel of information disclosure is through the fired employees.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:01.000
If we continue to describe the three main channels of information disclosure,

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:23.000
we can say that there are several options for information disclosure through the employees.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
The first is the so-called motivated disclosure.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:33.000
The second is the unmotivated disclosure.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:39.000
The third is the unmotivated disclosure.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.000
The unmotivated disclosure is a disclosure where there are no motives for disclosing this information.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000
In a simplified version, this is the simplest and most elementary type of disclosure.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:04.000
People simply do not represent the value of the information they possess, and are simply unmotivated and unmotivated.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Unfortunately, this is a serious problem.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:15.000
In teams where a large number of people work, there are people who are simply unmotivated and unmotivated.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Explaining to them what is allowed and what is not allowed, usually does not lead to anything, because people usually disclose everything.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Even if you tell them that it is impossible to say, on the contrary, they will probably disclose it to a greater extent.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Therefore, everything that concerns unmotivated disclosure, these people are usually calculated,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:53.000
they are usually limited by confidential information, and in the future, under some pretexts, they are fired.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.000
It is very difficult to cure them, and usually useless.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000
There are certain criteria by which these people are calculated,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that is, in principle, it is easy to calculate them, it is simple to calculate them,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000
and there are certain psychological features of these people.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:20.000
These may be people who abuse alcohol, because what is sober in the mind, is drunk in the tongue.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000
That is, a person in a state of alcohol intoxication simply discloses this information.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:32.000
These are people who are creatively involved, it is very difficult to draw a line between them,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:42.000
when a person can still control his actions, and when a person cannot control his actions.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:49.000
That is, in the burst of creativity, a person can simply disclose and reveal commercial secrets.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000
These are impulsive people, these are people who are dissatisfied with something,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:01.000
very often women's groups suffer from this, that is, unmotivated disclosure of information.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
A person does not get anything for this, no dividends, no material benefits,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
he just discloses information because of his easy-going and talkativeness.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:16.000
A lot of information is disclosed in smoking rooms, from the point of view of unmotivated things.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Sometimes it is enough to ask a person how are you doing, and get a lot of interesting confidential information.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.000
This is all that concerns unmotivated disclosure through employees of the company.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Motivated disclosure is a disclosure that is based on certain motives.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Moreover, motives can be used not only for disclosure of information, but also for some illegal actions.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:01.000
If we talk about motives, the list of these motives is quite large.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
It cannot be said that it is exhaustive, that is, everything that concerns motivated disclosure,

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:16.000
is usually a psychological feature of people, and all motivated disclosure is based on psychology.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Since psychology is different for each person, the list of motives is not exhaustive.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000
There are, I would say, the most common motives and the least common motives.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:38.000
If we talk about the most common motivated disclosure, it is probably money.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:47.000
This is greed, this is the use of money to get some information or make a person do some actions.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:54.000
That is, a person discloses information or performs some actions, and in return receives a certain amount of money.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000
There is an active approach and a passive approach.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:19.000
The passive approach assumes that a person finds people who know certain information,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:27.000
of course, valuable information, some kind of private information, people who have more expenses than income,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
that is, people in need of money.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:38.000
They are offered to solve their material problems in exchange for, say, disclosure of some information or performing some actions.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
This is the so-called passive approach.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
The active approach is when a person in need of some confidential information,

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.000
but unfortunately he does not need money,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.000
then an active event is held to make this person need money.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Then he is offered to solve his material problems in order to get some information from him or make him perform some actions.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
How to make a person need money?

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Again, this is a creative question, there are many different options.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000
If this is a greedy person, then you can take him to a casino.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.000
If this is an enthusiastic person, then you can give him a woman, or some other things.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000
There are many ways to make him take a loan that he cannot pay.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
This is a creative approach.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:37.000
This approach is widely used, because money is a fairly universal product that many people need.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:44.000
The second point that is widely used is the point of offense.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Why does a person perform some actions or disclose information?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Simply because he was offended.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
He can be offended for various reasons.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
It can be some legal offenses, it can be illegal offenses,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000
offense for illegal dismissal, offense for not taking a position,

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
offense for not realizing some creative potential, and so on.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000
In general, an offended person is always a bomb of slow action,

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.000
which, as a rule, explodes at the most inappropriate moment.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:27.000
So, I want to say that you should try to make sure that you do not offend people.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Because an offended person is usually a problem.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Especially an offended person who knows the commercial secrets and has some certain powers.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:46.000
There are quite a few cases in life when the offense of a person leads to a serious problem in the company.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:55.000
The third point is quite common, I would say,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.000
concerning the motivated disclosure of information or motivated performance of some actions.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
This is blackmail.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
This is blackmail.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
What is blackmail?

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Blackmail is clear.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
This is a certain compromising action of this person,

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000
which has a certain evidence base of these actions.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
And a person is blackmailed by some things,

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
that is, by some actions that this person has committed or, perhaps, has committed around this person.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000
As a rule, the higher the position a person occupies,

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.000
the more he takes care of his impeccable reputation.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000
And, as a rule, he is more susceptible to blackmail.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Therefore, this motive for disclosure of information or for performing some actions related to blackmail,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000
it is usually used for the leading link.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Because blackmailing a loader with immoral acts is quite pointless,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:04.000
because he can do these immoral acts every day and not regret it at all.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.000
And the leader, let's say, the organization or some leading link,

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000
can be very sensitive in terms of his impeccable reputation.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Blackmailing is generally based on…

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Again, there are several approaches.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
As a rule, the approach is active and passive.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Active and passive.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:36.000
The passive approach is to find out the compromising information about the past life of a person.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.000
And it is already a blackmail object.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.000
That is, this is the information or the actions that a person has committed in the past.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:53.000
In principle, as far as I understand, every person has some dark sides of his life.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
As the English say, every person has his own skeleton in the closet.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
The most important thing is to find some evidence of these dark moments

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.000
and think about how to use them for blackmail or discrediting.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Active blackmail is when there is no time to look for this compromising information

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000
or when there is no time.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Then the organization conducts an event to make a person commit some compromising actions.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.000
In the future, all this is removed, fixed and used for blackmail or discrediting.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Unfortunately, the compilation of compromising information is a shadow business,

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
which is unfortunately developing in Russia.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
There are even whole organizations that specialize in the compilation of compromising information.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:54.000
The compilation of all these information resources can go in different directions.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.000
There are detectives who are engaged in the collection of information,

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:06.000
including information of dubious content.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Sometimes information agencies are engaged in this.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Unfortunately, this business is quite developed.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:25.000
The following three reasons for disclosing information are the main reasons.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I say that the list of reasons is not exhaustive.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:34.000
If we talk about other reasons, what can I pay attention to?

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:44.000
For example, the fear of a person for his life, for himself and his loved ones.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000
A person can have an impeccable reputation,

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
he can never take money, never get into a tricky situation,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:03.000
never commit any compromising actions.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
A person is weak by nature,

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:12.000
he has a surrounding in the form of a wife, husband, children, material values, business interests, etc.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000
For this reason, he can worry.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
This can also be a way for one person to influence another person

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
in order to get some information or to commit some actions.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:29.000
The motive can be the most common factor of pain.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000
A person can have an impeccable reputation,

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
but unfortunately, he will be punished.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
He will tell everything he knows and everything he does not know.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Fortunately, this is not so often applied now.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
But it should be assumed that a person can tell everything he knows.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Then we talk about methods of influence,

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.000
about means, methods, measures, purposefulness, etc.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Therefore, the framework of security is usually based on the fact

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:09.000
that a person can disclose and tell all the information resources he knows.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.000
There is such a motive, let's say, sexual emotionality.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:30.000
This is not blackmail, this is a so-called sexual partner's set-up

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.000
in order to get information or to force him to commit some illegal actions.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:42.000
At the level of world practice, let's remember the matchmaker Mata Hari in the First World War.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
She earned information with her body.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:52.000
This is a channel of information getting.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:01.000
There are some motives of information getting, let's call them national motives.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Fortunately or unfortunately, our country is multinational.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Businesses are often built on national characteristics.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000
If people of one nation are in one organization,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.000
and a person of the same nation or ethnicity is in another organization,

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:28.000
then the channels of influence, that is, the motives, can be based on nationality.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:33.000
We are of the same blood, from the same settlement, from the same region.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Tell me, share, etc.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
There are quite a lot of cases in life.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Motives can be religious.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Although this is not often found in business.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Our country, fortunately or unfortunately, is multi-religious.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And the information can be obtained on the basis of various religious motives and aspects.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000
There is a motive related to depression.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:18.000
A person has certain psychological features,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
related to some depressive state.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Either he is entering a special state of depression,

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000
or he can periodically fall into a state of depression,

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000
a state of affect, a state of psychological uneasiness.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000
At this moment, a person receives information,

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000
or forces him to disclose it, or to perform some actions.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.000
There is a motive related to, let's say, the inner adventurism of a person.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Inner adventurism of a person.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
This motive is independent, it is usually not used.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.000
This motive is associated with some other motives.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.000
It is clear that there may not be one motive,

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
there may be several motives for obtaining information.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Basically, this motive is associated with inner adventurism.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000
It is used for some young people who like to play Stirlitz,

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
scouts, in some kind of adventure games.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Such cases also occur.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:38.000
There are motives associated with psychological things.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
The basis is psychology.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
That is, the motive of obtaining information.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I will stop here in detail.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Two options are common now.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
This is the so-called NLP,

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Neuro-Linguistic Programming,

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
and this is hypnosis.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Hypnosis is a more rigid option.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:06.000
It is used not at every step, but nevertheless it is used.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
NLP is now widely used.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
In a nutshell, I will draw this thing.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
The use of NLP elements in personnel work,

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.000
including personnel safety.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
NLP, Neuro-Linguistic Programming,

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000
was used for a long time,

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
probably several centuries ago.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.000
For the first time, the English started to talk about NLP

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
in the Second World War.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:40.000
The English scouts started to use NLP elements.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
How to get information from a person?

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:49.000
The American scientists translated this into a scientific basis.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:54.000
In the 1950s, it was generally considered that NLP was an American product.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Although the Americans just made a scientific justification

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
and put it all on a scientific basis.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.000
The methods of NLP were developed long ago.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Several elements related to NLP are used.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:22.000
In particular, if you want to get in touch with a person

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
in order to get information from him,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000
there is such a principle of mirroring in NLP.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:36.000
You duplicate the movement, walk, breath of another person.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000
After a while, there is a certain comfort between you

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:47.000
and a certain position of one person from another.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
And you can try to get information from a person.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
What do I mean by duplication?

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000
A person is sitting in the same position.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
You can adjust your breathing to his breathing.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
If we talk about safety,

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
thieves and pocket watchmen use this method very widely.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
When a person is sitting in a train and he is sleeping,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
a thief sits down and starts to swing.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:19.000
After a while, there is a certain harmony between these two people.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
And this thief can say,

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
let's give him a wallet and he will give it to him.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.000
This is the relationship between each other

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000
at the level of neural linguistic programming.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Let's say NLP is a method of transferring information.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:47.000
It is a way to convince a person to do something or to disclose something.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Each person has a certain channel of receiving information.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.000
All people are divided into so-called audiolysts, visualists and kinesthetics.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Audiolysts are people who perceive the world through the organs of vision.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
They need to see everything.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
They say, I see.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000
In order to achieve the location of these people,

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.000
that is, to make them disclose some information,

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000
they need to be transmitted through their organs of vision.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
They need to write everything,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
they need to look good,

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.000
because this is primary information for them.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Audiolysts perceive everything by ear.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
They say, I hear.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
In order to achieve their location or make them do something,

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
make them disclose information,

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.000
they need to be transmitted through the organs of hearing.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:56.000
If we talk about the third direction of kinesthetics,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
they usually say, I feel.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
These are people who need to touch, feel everything.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
That is, to receive information from the outside world

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
through the contact, through kinesthetic sensations.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
In order to achieve their location,

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.000
to make them do something or to transmit some information,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
they need to touch, feel something.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Then they will transmit this information.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Therefore, one of the directions,

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
for example, how the NLP element is used,

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
is to understand who is in front of you,

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
an audiolyst, a visualist or a kinesthetic,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
and try to convince him to do something

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.000
exactly on the channel that he has the most developed.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000
This is NLP.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:51.000
NLP is widely used now

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000
to train sales staff.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000
That is, how to convince a person to buy something.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
NLP is widely used

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000
to convince a person to do something,

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
in particular, to buy something.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:14.000
NLP is widely used in personnel security,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
in negotiations.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
That is, in order to convince a person to do something,

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
to convince him to make a decision,

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
to tell about something,

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
NLP is used.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Hypnosis is a more serious thing,

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
a rather scary thing.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000
It is used less often than NLP,

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
but nevertheless it is a very serious threat

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
in terms of personnel security.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
What is the threat?

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.000
As a rule, everything that concerns

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000
illegal actions on hypnosis

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
is either disclosure of information,

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.000
or the execution of some actions,

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000
or, again, the conviction of something.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Moreover, disclosure of information

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
in a state of hypnosis,

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
a person can disclose this information,

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:09.000
and in the future he will not even remember

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
that he first told something to someone,

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
and he will not remember,

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
and he will tell only the truth,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
only what actually exists.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
In a state of hypnosis, he will not deceive,

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
he will not deceive,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
he will not mislead,

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
he will tell the truth.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
This is a feature of hypnosis.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
And he will not remember that he told something to someone.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
You can make someone do some actions

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
in a state of hypnosis.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Gypsies use hypnosis a lot.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Unfortunately, these are such illegal actions

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
that can be done using elements of hypnosis.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
In banking security,

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
you can face problems with hypnosis.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.000
In particular, a few years ago,

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000
there was a problem with exchange points.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000
A person who had a cashier

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
entered the cashier of the exchange point

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
in a state of hypnotic sleep,

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
gave, for example, 10 rubles,

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
convinced her that it was not 10 rubles,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
but 1000 dollars,

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000
and the cashier gave a change,

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
and the cashier,

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
the employee of the exchange point,

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
exchanged the change

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
based on a completely different bill.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
There was such a problem.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
A whole group of people

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
who were engaged in such things

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
was neutralized.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
The problem of hypnosis,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
unfortunately, is quite relevant.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
How to protect yourself from hypnosis?

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Immediately a question arises.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
How is it solved?

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
It is quite difficult to introduce

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
a person into a hypnotic sleep.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
There are times when you can understand

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.000
that something is wrong with a person.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
At this moment, try to get away from this person,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000
try to stop some actions.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Hypnosis is transmitted through the gaze,

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
through hearing, through touch.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Therefore, at the initial stage,

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
you can still try to do something.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Hypnosis cannot be said

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
to be some kind of contraindicatory

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
initial action,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
or rather, that it is initial evil.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
It is like a way of affecting

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
one person on another.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
This method can be used

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
either for good or evil.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Hypnosis is taught.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.000
There is such a concept as medical hypnosis.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
That is, the state of hypnosis

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
takes a person out of a state

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
of severe stress.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Hypnosis can be used

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
for contraindicatory purposes.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
That is, the purpose, as I said,

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
is either to get information,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
or to perform some actions,

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
or to gain a belief.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
There are quite exotic methods

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.000
to come up with a purpose for hypnosis.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
A person enters a state of hypnosis,

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
reads certain information,

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
and then leaves the state of hypnosis.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
He moves to another country,

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
where he is introduced

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
to the state of hypnosis.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
He tells all this,

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:18.000
although he will not remember it himself.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
That is, it is like using a person

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
as a carrier of certain information.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Unfortunately, hypnosis and all

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
that concerns psychological methods

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
is one of the motives for obtaining information.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
On the basis of not only the conscious,

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
but also the unconscious motive.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
There may be other motives

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
for obtaining information,

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
but I have described them to you

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
as the most common and significant.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
If we talk about the objects

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
that are most subject to the motives

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
for obtaining information,

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
based on the motives that exist,

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.000
these are those that have certain defects

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
in behavior, in psychological appearance,

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
passion for alcohol,

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
sexual entertainment, drugs, etc.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Or those who have a biographical stain.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
All these motives are used

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
to obtain information.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
But what is the purpose of hypnosis?

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
What is the purpose of hypnosis?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Objects suitable for the motives

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
for obtaining information

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
are those who have debts.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
It is clear that people who have debts

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
are a group of risk.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
These are people who can be used

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
by various techniques

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
in order to either get information

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.000
from them or force them to do some actions.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000
People who are strongly attached to something.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
People who, for some reason,

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
are not able to get information

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
from them,

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
and who are very irritated for some reason.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.000
So-called recruitment based on resentment.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
I did not tell these points

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
from the point of view

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
that you received information

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
from someone,

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
and used these motivated things.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.000
I probably told it from the point of view

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
that these motives

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
for obtaining information

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
or for performing some actions

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
can be used against you.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
If you are an object,

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
let's say, an LPR,

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
a person who makes decisions,

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
then these motives

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
can be used against you

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
in order to either get information

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
from you or force you to do something.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Therefore, there are some recommendations

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
that, let's say,

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
recommendations on counteracting

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
the establishment of so-called

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
recruitment contact,

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
or motivated contact.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Well, it is not to get involved

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
in quarrels and scandals,

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
not to show excessive awareness

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
in anything,

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
except when it is required

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
during some business negotiations.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
It is clear that

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
those people who usually

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
use these motivated approaches

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
are those people,

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
let's say,

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
who either know something

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
or can learn something.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
If a person does not know

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
what to do,

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
then, in general,

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
there is no point in

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
performing some recruitment approaches

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
in order to get some information.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Therefore, it is not appropriate,

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
probably, as a recommendation,

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
to show that you know something,

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
have some commercial secrets,

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
some secrets, and so on.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
There is a recommendation

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
related to the storage

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
of your commercial secrets,

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
your, let's say,

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
official secrets

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
from your close friends.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Well, this is due to the fact

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
that they will be able

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
to get information

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
not only from you,

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
but also from your environment,

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
that is, from your close friends.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
First of all, you are just setting up

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
these people, because they will

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
already receive information from them.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Well, of course, there is no guarantee

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
that they will protect your secrets.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
That is, they told their life

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
companions some commercial secrets,

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
and the next day

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
it became known all over the city.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Unfortunately, there were such

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
real-life cases.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Well, the analysis of your life,

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
probably,

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
is not the goal

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
of what I have achieved

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
in 30, 40,

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
50, 60 years.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
The analysis of your life

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
from the point of view of determining

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
some motives in this life,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
some moments related

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
to problems,

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
to situations

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
that can be used

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
for blackmail or discrediting.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Well, it is clear that

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
nothing can be changed

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
from the past life,

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
that is, you will not change anything

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
in your past life,

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
but at least you will be able

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
to illuminate these moments

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
from your point of view

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
to break the ground

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
from those people

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Well, the recommendation

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
may be to find out

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
your weaknesses,

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
that is, to analyze your psychological

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
components,

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
your hobbies, alcohol, sex,

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
money, character traits, and so on.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I, of course, do not urge you

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
to change these character traits

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
if you think it is necessary,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
but for God's sake.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Just keep in mind that these approaches,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
motivated approaches to disclosure of information,

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
they usually use some psychological

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
components of a person.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Knowing them, you will simply know

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
that these motives may be suitable for you

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
in order to get information from you

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
or make you do some actions.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Well, probably

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
what else can be recommended?

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Well, the analysis of contacts

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
is also a recommendation

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
to counteract the establishment

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
of such agent contacts,

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
because if you understand

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
why a person starts

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
trying to get close to you,

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
it's probably good.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
That is, you need to give a clear report

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
why a person starts trying to get close to you.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
If it is some kind of physiological

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
needs, it is understandable.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
When it is not clear why a person

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
does it, then it is always

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
a so-called hazard.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Well, this is the point.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
So, what else

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
I would like to draw

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
your attention to?

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Well, now we are with you,

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
in general, I told you

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
the moments related

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
to the threats

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
that arise from the human factor,

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
and some of the moments

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I covered the options

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
for the implementation of these threats.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
The next aspect is

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
how to build personnel work,

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
how to build relationships

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
with the staff

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
from the point of view of personnel security,

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
in order to neutralize all the moments

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
related to the threat

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
of disclosure of information

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
or the threat of committing

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
some illegal actions.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
So, personnel work.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
So, here I will cover

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
some aspects

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
that are related to security,

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
almost directly related to security,

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
but I will not go into

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
the details of this topic,

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
which should be taken into account

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
when the event will be held.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
So, this is the motivation of the staff.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Motivation of the staff.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
The term is quite fashionable,

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
motivation of the staff.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
There is even such a term as

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
motivated staff,

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
unmotivated staff.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I like the term motivated

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
because it is associated

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
with the term to swear.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Nevertheless,

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
such a term is used.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
What is motivation?

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Motivation is, in fact,

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
not a hook,

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
but some reasons

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
why a person works in an organization.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Naturally, the more reasons,

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
the more hooks,

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
the more moments

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
that make a person work

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
in an organization,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
the less problematic

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
this person is.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
With a motivated person,

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
it is much easier to solve

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
security issues.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
There is even a whole seminar

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
about motivation.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I will just tell you

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
the problem of motivation

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
from the point of view

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
of personnel security.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
All motivation is divided

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
into two large groups.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
This is immaterial.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
It is clear.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Material motivation is

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
motivation that is

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
related to certain material benefits.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Immaterial motivation is

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
motivation that is not

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
related to material benefits.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
So, more strongly

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
immaterial motivation is considered.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
It is clear that

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
material motivation is related

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
to money or material benefits.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
In any case,

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
some organization can offer

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
more material benefits,

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
and a person will leave you.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Therefore, it is believed

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
that the strongest motivation

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
is immaterial.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
The strongest, perhaps,

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
immaterial motivation is

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
ideology.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Ideology.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
It is difficult to achieve

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
ideological motivation

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
in a commercial structure.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I have not encountered

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
companies where the staff

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
is motivated from the point of view

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
of ideology.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
But if it succeeds,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
it will be a very strong and solid company.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Ideology.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
What can be the forms,

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
what can be the options?

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
It can be, for example,

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
religion.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
It can be some kind of

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
patriotic or corporate idea.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
It can be

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
the struggle of a small

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
oppressed people

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
for their self-awareness

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
and independence.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
It can be ideology or an idea.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
From the point of view of immaterial motivation,

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
let's say, in Moscow,

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
it is very common,

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
it is the closeness of work to home.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
The closeness of work to home.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
It is clear that

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
if a person lives in the north of Moscow,

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
goes to the south of Moscow every day,

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
spends several hours on the road,

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
if a person finds

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
a company that will pay,

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
all other

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
motivation systems will be the same,

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
and a person finds

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
work near the house,

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
he will leave the organization to work

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
near the house.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
So, the immaterial motivation

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
in the form of the closeness of work to home

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
is typical only for Moscow.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
For regional companies,

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
it may not be very typical.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
What can be noted

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
from the immaterial?

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Let's say, self-employment.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Self-employment.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Very strong immaterial motivation

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
is due to the fact that

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
a person works because he likes it.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
He likes to paint.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
He will paint every day.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
If you assign him to a position

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
related to leadership,

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
he will not work because he does not like it.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Here,

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
from the immaterial motivation,

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
is the moral-psychological climate.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Moral-psychological climate.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Why does a person work?

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Because it is a very comfortable

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
moral-psychological climate.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
A person may not get a salary for half a year

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
and will go to work.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Why does he go to work?

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
The team is good, the company is good.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
And a person can get

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
very decent money,

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
but he leaves work because

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
everyone is like scorpions in a jar,

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
everyone is trying to sting each other.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Material motivation

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
is money.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
A person must receive

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
a certain monetary reward

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
for his work.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
This monetary reward

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
should not be lower

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
than the average

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
in the region,

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
in the industry,

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
in the position, etc.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Then it will be material motivation

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
based on money.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
It can be from material motivation

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
some kind of social package.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Now it is a very fashionable direction.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
In personnel policy,

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
it is a social package.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
In addition to money,

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
a person receives certain benefits

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
related to social protection,

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
social security.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
It can be a compensation

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
for travel,

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
free lunch,

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
some kind of trips,

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
a social package.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
It can be a brand.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
I would put the word

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
brand here.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
A brand company.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
A person works

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
in a very respectable

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
brand company.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
He is proud of it.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
He has a certain corporate culture, etc.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Material motivation

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
usually includes

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
working conditions.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Working conditions.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
A person works

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
in good conditions,

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
with air conditioners,

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
with repairs, with Euro-repair,

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
modern equipment, etc.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
The other thing is that

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
working conditions can be much worse.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
It is not motivated.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
The material motivation

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
is financial commitment.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Financial commitment.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
It is about the fact

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
that a person binds

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
a worker to himself

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
by financial commitments.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
He can send him to school,

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
pay for his education,

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
buy him an apartment,

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
etc.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
A person is bound

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
to a company by financial commitments.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
The most important thing here

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
is not to overdo it

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
and not to abuse it.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
If a person is too much

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
bound to a company by financial commitments,

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
it is difficult to get rid of it.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
This is a very common

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
material motivation of a person.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
There may be

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
some other options.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
For example,

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
this is not material,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
but a given authority.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
A given authority.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
It can be

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
some personal goals

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
of a person.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
It can be material

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
or not.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
For example,

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
a person gets a work experience.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
He is interested in getting

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
a certain work experience.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
This is a motivation

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
of a person working in a company.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
You can write it down further.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
This is not an exhaustive list.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
These are just the main directions

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
of a person's work experience.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
I want to add

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
one more thing.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I want to stop at this point.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
The more motivated

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
a person is,

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
the less problems

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
he will have.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
I have encountered

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
situations

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
when a company

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
is creating a promising direction

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
or a promising project.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
There are two candidates

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
for this position.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
One is Ivan Ivanov,

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
the other is Petrov Petrovich.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
The situation is analyzed

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
by these people

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
and by the security service.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
The security service

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
says that Ivan Ivanov

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
is well motivated

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
and has a lot of reasons

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
why he works

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
in this company.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
There are no problems

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
with this information.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Petrov Petrovich

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
is a professional,

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
but he has no reasons

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
why he works here.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Either we should appoint Ivan Ivanov

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
or Petrov.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
We should organize

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
an event

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
to motivate this person.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
We should bind him to this company.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Then we can trust him

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
with a promising project

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
if we want him to be a leader

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
and a competitor.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
The motivation of the staff

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
is directly connected

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
with the security service.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
The next thing

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I would like to point out

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
is the security service line.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
It is

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
professionalism.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Professionalism is not only

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
among the security service employees.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Everyone should be a professional

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
in his or her field.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Then it is much more effective

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
to build a security system

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
than when

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
non-professionals work.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Professionalism is achieved

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
by a competent selection of staff.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
You can train your staff

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
to become professionals.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
You can use a staff agency.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
You can recruit people.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
You can do hand-hunting.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
You can lure staff.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
The point is

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
to form a team.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
It is a fashionable method

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
of teamwork.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
The next thing I would like to point out

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
is the moral and psychological climate.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
The moral and psychological climate.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
It is important to understand

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
that the security of the staff

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
and the security of the organization

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
depends on the moral and psychological climate.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
To put it simply,

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
if the CEO

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
rides the latest Mercedes model

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
and the employees

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
do not receive their salary for six months,

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
then there is no need

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
to talk about serious security.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
You will never build a security system there.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
The moral and psychological climate

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
is achieved by several things.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
It is a whole set of events.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
It is like a training process.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
It is a whole set of events.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
The formation of

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
the so-called corporate culture

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
is achieved.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
The corporate culture.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
I can say that

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
the corporate culture

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
is based on the behavior

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
of a person.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
It is not based on

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
any external forms.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
We all wear red jackets.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
This is our corporate culture.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
If a person wears a blue jacket,

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
it is a violation of corporate culture.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
It is not about

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
the appearance.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
It is about the behavior.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
It is a code of behavior.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
The moral and psychological climate

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
can be formed

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
by the work of psychologists.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Psychologists

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
are often used

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
for the security

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
of the staff

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
and the corporate security.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Because many problems

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
can be solved

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
by the professional work

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
of a psychologist

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
when the psychologist

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
is a professional.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
It is about

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
the moral and psychological climate.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
It is about the selection of staff.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
There are organizations

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
where psychologists work

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
professionally

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
for the security of the staff.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
But I can say that

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
the organizations

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
do not use the resources of psychologists.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
For example,

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
a team is excited

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
because it is not efficient.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
A psychologist,

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
after testing the team

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
and making a psychological portrait

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
of each person,

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
will tell the psychologist

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
to remove a person from the team.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
The team becomes calm

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
and efficient.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
This is the work of a psychologist.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Psychologists are widely used

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
when setting up staff.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
It is right to understand

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
that there is a psychological feature

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
of a person that cannot be changed.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
But it can be used.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
There are four types of personalities.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
There is a blood type,

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
a melancholic,

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
a phlegmatic, a choleric.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
It is what is given by nature

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
and what does not change.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Knowing who is in front of you

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
of these four types of personalities,

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
you can understand

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
how to use it.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
There is a concept

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
of a strong nervous system,

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
a person can work

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
for 8 hours

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
in a monotonous and scrupulous way.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Then he should rest for 8 hours.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
A weak nervous system

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
is a person who works

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
for half an hour,

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
then he should rest for half an hour.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
It does not mean that it is a bad

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
or good nervous system.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
It is a certain psychological feature.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Knowing it, you will set up people

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
and there will be fewer problems.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Psychologists can assess

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
whether a person can work with people

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
or not.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
If a person is well-led

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
by 5 people,

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
you will put him

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
on a team of 100 people.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
The psychology of a person

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
will not allow him

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
to lead 100 people.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
If he leads 5 people well,

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
he will not be able to lead 100 people.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Not because he is bad,

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
but because it is a psychological feature.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
There is a concept of an introvert.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
A person is either closed

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
or communicative.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
If you put a person

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
to work in a closed sales department,

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
he will not be able to work

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
because he is a thing in himself.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
That is why psychologists work very well

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
in the field of personnel safety.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
There are

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
other points

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
about personnel safety.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
There is a certain percentage ratio.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
If we talk about

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
theft,

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
then the issue of

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
theft is a problem.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
10% of people

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
always steal.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
No matter

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
what motivation

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
they have,

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
what salary they have.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
This is a habit.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
10%

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
never

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
steal.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
They

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
steal

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
because

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
they believe

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
that

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
no matter

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
how difficult

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
the situation is,

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
they will never steal.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
80%

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
steal when

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
there are conditions

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
and when there is no control.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
They steal

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
when there are conditions.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
When there are conditions.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Roughly speaking,

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
a person will take

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
some money

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
when he understands

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
that he will be punished.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
You can argue about the percentage.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
It is written in smart books.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
This is about our country.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
In Muslim countries,

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
where there is a fence

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
where fingers and hands are cut off,

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
the percentage may be completely different.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
In our country, the ratio is approximately the same.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
So,

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
based on this,

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
what is the task

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
of the security service?

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
It is clear that

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
those people who always steal

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
should be eliminated.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Those people who never steal

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
should be left

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
if they represent something.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
The biggest problem is

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
these 80%.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
The main task here

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
is not to create conditions for stealing.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
If you are engaged

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
in some provocative activities,

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
you will put money somewhere

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
and see who will take it and who will not.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
You will find out that

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
90% of people

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
will take the money

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
if they know that no one sees them.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
You can fire all of them

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
and get new 90%.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
The ratio will be exactly the same.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
I am very skeptical

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
about various

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
provocative activities

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
of the security service

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
because

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
the percentage is exactly the same.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
We should not create conditions.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
I would like to draw your attention

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
to one more thing.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
There is a term

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
for critical or problematic people.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
To address

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
the attention

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
of either critical people

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
or critical employees.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
What is it?

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
As I said,

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
if we talk about

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
disclosure of information,

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
the whole team is scanned

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
in terms of identifying

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
those people who can

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
do the right thing

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
or disclose the information.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Those people

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
are paid more attention.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
What do I mean?

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Let's say,

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
IT specialist

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
or IT security

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
is engaged in protection

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
of information resources.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
This is a critical person

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
because he needs special attention.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
The secretary of the company

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
may not know anything

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
but she is responsible

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
for a lot of confidential documents.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
It can be

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
the same cleaners

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
who can

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
do some illegal actions

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
in terms of

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
disclosure of information,

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
installation of listening devices, etc.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
If we talk about

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
critical employees

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
who can do some illegal actions,

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
the whole team is scanned

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
and it looks like

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
the person

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
needs money

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
for different reasons.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
The patient needs an expensive surgery

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
and the patient has no money

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
for the surgery.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
But he will have to solve this problem.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
We can assume that he will do

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
some illegal actions

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
because he will try

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
to find money illegally.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Many things

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
can be predicted.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
You know,

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
a person came from

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
a state-owned organization

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
of a factory

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
where the principle was

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
that the owner is not a guest

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
and he has to carry every nail.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
The person has a habit

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
of stealing.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
We can assume that he has this habit

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
and he has not gotten rid of it.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Let's recall a famous story

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
about a golden calf

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
when Shura Balaganov

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
gave a huge amount of money

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
to the bandit

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
who would have enough money

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
for his days.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
And he got into a tram

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
with 3 rubles.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Why did he get into the tram?

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Because of his habit.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Many things can be predicted.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
If you see

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
or hear about

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
security services

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
that there is a security guard

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
and they have some intimate relations

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
and they are connected by work,

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
so the security guard is watching the cashier,

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
then you can assume

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
that their actions will be illegal.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
They should be divorced,

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
at least by the service,

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
so that they are not connected.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Many illegal actions

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
can be predicted.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
A woman works,

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
she marries a man

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
who works in a competing company.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Can we predict any consequences?

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
I think we can.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
We can try to predict

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
and prevent

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
any consequences

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
related to these critical people.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
I will give you

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
only a few examples.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
You can describe it in detail later.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Life is too multifaceted,

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
so many things can be predicted.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
It is possible.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
I will remind you

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
about the old principle

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
of the personnel policy.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
It is the principle of a wick and a gingerbread.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
A wick and a gingerbread.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
It is very effective

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
from the perspective of personnel security.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
The principle of a wick and a gingerbread

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
should be applied

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
to people.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
There should be a gingerbread

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
in the form of motivation.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
There should be a wick

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
that is in the form of

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
responsibility.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Responsibility related to

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
the responsibility of the staff,

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
administrative responsibility,

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
criminal responsibility.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
I will also draw your attention

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
to the personnel policy

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
on the line of personnel security.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
This is the relationship

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
between the security service

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
and the personnel.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
And the personnel.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Such relations will have to be established

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
in any case.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
It should be based on

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
the example I gave

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
about the barricades.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
There should be a barricade

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
where the security service and the personnel

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
are not allowed to go.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
And there should be

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
some illegal actions

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
or potential violations.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
How to build it?

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
There are different points.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
In principle, the security service

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
should help the personnel.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
The personnel should look

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
at the security service

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
not as a monster,

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
a mini KGB,

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
who walks, looks,

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
peeps, listens.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
The security service should help

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
the personnel.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
But according to the law,

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
it may not do it.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
According to the law,

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
the security service

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
should provide security

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
only to the founder.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
It is not obligatory

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
to solve the personal problems

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
of the employees of the enterprise.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
But I think it should be done

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
to build these relations.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
And this help may not

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
be a big deal.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
For example,

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
a person sells a car

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
and receives cash.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
And the person asks

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
to give a couple of people

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
to stand next to him.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
There is nothing wrong

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
or expensive for the security service.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
But this person will treat

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
the security service

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
as an organization

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
that can help and support.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
And, of course,

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
the security service

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
should provide

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
a certain number of people.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
They are called

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
voluntary assistants.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
This problem exists.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Such people are not always

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
called sex workers,

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
secret employees,

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
drummers,

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
knockers, and so on.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
But here we should start

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
from the fact that there are

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
a lot of people

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
who are not

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
able to work.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
We should treat

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
the information

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
of the security service

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
positively or at least

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
calmly.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
If you drive a car

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
in Germany,

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
10 old ladies will call the police

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
and report that the car

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
has exceeded the speed limit.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
They do not perceive

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
this quality.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Everyone understands that a car

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
that has exceeded the speed limit

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
is a threat

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
to the residents,

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
to the elderly,

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
to the children,

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
to the grandchildren, and so on.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
The goal is to ensure

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
the security of the organization.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
The more solid and secure

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
the organization is,

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
the better the staff.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
But this problem exists.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
I will also mention

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
a rather fashionable

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
area.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
It is the use of polygraph

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
in the company testing.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
The use of polygraph.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
The use of polygraph.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
What is a polygraph?

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
It is a lie detector.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
I think everyone has heard about it.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
It is a legal business.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
It is a legal product.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
You can find

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
a lot of companies

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
that provide services

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
of polygraph.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
They sell polygraph.

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
There is nothing illegal here.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
You can't say

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
that it is a tool

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
of some special services.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
What should be taken into account

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
if the security service

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
will use polygraph

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
in the personnel security?

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
The first thing

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
is the legal aspect.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
The testing of polygraph

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
should be voluntary.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
You can't test a person

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
with polygraph

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
just because

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
the director wants it.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
If a person doesn't want

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
to be tested,

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
you can't force him.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
So, usually,

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
if a polygraph is being tested,

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
the application is collected

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
and the test is conducted.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Usually, it is a statement

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
of the testers' consent

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
to test polygraph.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
There are some features

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
of the contactless polygraph

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
that can be legended.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
You can't legend the contactless one.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
This is the first point.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Voluntary.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
The second point

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
of the polygraph testing

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
is that the result

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
is not a proof.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
You can't fire a person

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
just because he showed polygraph.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
You can't impose a conviction

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
on a person just because he showed polygraph.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
It is like Stirlitz's

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
information to think.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
It is where you need to dig deeper.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
It is a kind of information to think.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
When is polygraph used?

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Usually,

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
it is a

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
method of work.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
A method of work.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
There are organizations

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
that

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
constantly

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
use polygraph

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
when they come to work.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
If there is a need,

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
it can be done.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
When they come to work,

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
they usually find out

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
the standard options.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Does a person

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
use drugs?

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Is he connected

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
to criminal elements?

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Is he connected to criminals?

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
To competitors?

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Polygraph is used

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
in the current activity.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
What is the current activity?

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
The leader

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
wants to know

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
if the bribes are taken or not.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Do the employees

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
sit on the rolls?

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
There is a kind of current activity.

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
It is a common

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
case.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Nevertheless, there are companies

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
where the current activity

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
is provided

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
through polygraph.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
The most common

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
option is

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
a service investigation.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
A service

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
investigation.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
When something

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
happened,

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
some money was stolen,

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
then a service investigation

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
is conducted

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
using polygraph.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
It is the most common

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
option.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
The types of polygraph

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
that you need to know

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
if you

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
use polygraph services.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Polygraph.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
What is available

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
on the market,

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
what you can buy.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
There are two options.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Contact

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
and contactless.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Contactless.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Contactless.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
It is a classic

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
polygraph.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
There are 8-12 sensors

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
that track a person

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
and measure his parameters.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Breathing,

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
abdominal, chest,

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
pulse, sweat,

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
voice, pupil,

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
tremor sensor,

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
motor activity,

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
muscle activity, etc.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
These sensors are

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
connected to a block

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
where all the information is stored.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Then a computer is connected,

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
graphics are built, etc.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
The principle of operation is simple.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
It was developed in the 1920s.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
First, a person is set up.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
A polygraph is set up

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
for a specific person.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
First, a person is asked

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
questions,

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
the answers to which are not known.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
For example,

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
it is winter now,

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
and it is clear that a person answers yes.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
It is necessary to answer

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
either yes or no.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
There is no need to think,

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
fantasize, or invent.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
The parameters of a person are measured

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
when it is clear that he is telling the truth.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
After that,

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
mathematical calculations

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
give certain conclusions

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
about whether a person is telling the truth

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
or not.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
This is a classical contact polygraph.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
A contact polygraph

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
is usually implemented

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
as a mind reader.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
It is a little bit

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
complicated.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
It is a simple

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
computer program.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
It is a computer program

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
that can be used

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
to read a book.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
There is a slightly different principle.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
The principle is a reaction of a person

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
to some questions.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
It is a question

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
whether the answer is meaningful

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
or not.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Usually, it is implemented

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
in the following way.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
You test a person on drugs.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
You are interested in the topic of drugs

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
that are applicable to this person.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
Words are typed

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
that are related to drugs.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
The screen of the monitor

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
shows this word for 15 milliseconds.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Then it is closed

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
by some chaotic set of numbers.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
A person needs to press

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
a magic button

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
like a joystick.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
He needs to press it.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
The reaction of a person is measured.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
The reaction will be different

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
depending on whether

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
this word is meaningful or not.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
It can be either fast

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
or slow.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
It will change.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Then the meaning

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
of this topic

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
is determined.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
If a person

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
is indifferent to this topic

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
and has a smooth reaction,

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
his reaction will be the same

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
as when answering all other questions

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
or neutral questions.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
A person can have

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
no words.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
He will be covered by numbers.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
A person's consciousness

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
will not react

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
to this word

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
with such a small value.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
A word for 0.15 seconds

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
will not be reacted by consciousness.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
You will not see what is written there.

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
You will see only the numbers

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
that will close this word.

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
But at the subconscious level

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
a person will react.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
The reaction will be different.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
This is the basis of the action

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
of this polygraph.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
It is widely popular.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
It has many advantages

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
in relation to the contact.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
It starts from time.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Testing one person

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
on a contactless polygraph

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
is much faster.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
It can be legendarized.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
A person will press a button

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
and he will not even know

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
that he is being tested on a polygraph.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
He will just say

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
that he is being measured

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
by a person's reaction.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
It is much less painful.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
When a person is confused

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
by wires and sensors,

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
it is a serious psychological trauma

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
or psychological pressure.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
A regular button

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
is much less painful

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
for a person.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Here are two options

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
either contact or contactless

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
that are available on the market

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
and can be bought.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
There is another option

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
but it is more theoretical.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
It is developed by Americans.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
The idea is that

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
when a person tells the truth,

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
he is involved in one number

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
of brain cells.

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
If he tries to deceive,

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
he is involved in a much larger number

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
of brain cells.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
The number of brain cells

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
involved is measured.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
If there are many of them,

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
there is a possibility

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
that a person is deceiving.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
This polygraph

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
is still in the theoretical development stage.

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Contact or contactless

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
is what you can buy

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
on the market.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
If we talk about

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
the use of a polygraph,

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
what should we pay attention to?

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
If you will

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
periodically use a polygraph

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
during a service investigation,

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
you can invite a specialist.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
If you will use it every day,

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
you need to take

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
a person,

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
buy this device,

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
teach this person,

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
take him to the US,

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
and so on.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
In the vast majority of cases,

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
people usually use other services.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Here is another thing

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
I want to draw your attention to

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
regarding the polygraph.

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Keep in mind that a lot depends on the polygraphist.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
A polygraph is

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
a tool

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
that is like a gun.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
A good gun

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
will hit the target

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
in good hands,

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
and in bad hands

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
it will not hit the target.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Although the gun itself will be good.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
Therefore, a polygraph is good.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
But it is always deceiving not the polygraph,

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
but the polygraphist.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
If you will choose

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
a polygraphist or polygraphologist,

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
pay special attention to the polygraphist.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
A lot depends on him.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
There are

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
some ways to deceive the polygraph.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
There is a pharmacological way,

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
that is,

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
the use of some

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
inhibiting or stimulating drugs.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
There is a physiological

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
way,

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
a mechanical way,

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
that is, the use of some painful sensations

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
to bite your tongue,

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
to knock down

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
the polygraph.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
There is a psychological way,

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
that is, to think about something

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
that is significant or insignificant for you.

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
Nevertheless,

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
a good polygraphist will understand

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
that he is being deceived.

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
A contactless polygraph,

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
what is good about it,

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
it is difficult to deceive it,

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
because a person does not even know

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
that he is being tested and will not understand

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
what he is being tested for.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Unlike a contactless polygraph,

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
when it is clear that it is a polygraph,

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
that all these questions are being tested.

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Therefore, this is the point.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Whether you will apply it or not,

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
you will see for yourself,

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
but at least it is one of the directions

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
of the formation of the personnel security.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
Here,

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
what else

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
I will draw your attention to.

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
Try not to plant bombs

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
of slow action

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
from the point of view

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
of personnel security.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
This is according to the line

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
of personnel security.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
Do not plant bombs

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
of slow action.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
I have already given examples.

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
For example,

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
if you fire a person

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
who knows your commercial secrets,

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
in a bad way,

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
it is a bomb of slow action.

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
There are many such options.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Here I can recommend

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
the application of a test period

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
for employees,

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
because, as a rule,

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
this is also related to the issue of security.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
Apply a certain policy

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
to select personnel

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
applicable to

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
certain categories of people.

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
First of all,

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
it is critical people.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
This is related to IT specialists,

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
because, as a rule,

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
they can pose a serious threat.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
A competent selection of the head

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
of the security service,

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
where the first place,

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
in my opinion,

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
is not even a question of professionalism,

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
but a question of loyalty.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
To people

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
who are appointed

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
to conduct some promising projects.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
These are some critical people.

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Now let's talk about

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
the acceptance

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
and dismissal

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
of employees.

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
If we write down

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
the acceptance questions,

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
what does the security service decide?

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
What do the personnel decide?

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
The personnel decide

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
the selection of employees,

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
the selection of personnel

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
with personnel,

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
and the issue of

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
the documentation.

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
What does the security service decide?

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
The security service

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
mainly decides

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
the inspection of employees.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
The inspection of candidates

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
for positions in your organization.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
The difficulty here is

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
that it is very difficult

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
to collect information

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
in a legal way.

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
There is a concept

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
of personal data,

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
there are personal data laws,

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
and it is very difficult

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
to collect legal information.

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
Unlike legal information collection

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
for legal persons.

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
Everything can be done legally,

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
but for personal data

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
it is difficult.

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
The inspection of the security service

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
of candidates

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
is based on different things.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
It is mainly assessed

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
by the threat to the organization

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
or not.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
In order to make a decision

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
whether a person poses a threat

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
to the organization or not,

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
the circle of information

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
about what is collected is determined.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
What information is collected?

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
What information

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
is collected about the candidate?

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
It is clear that

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
all the information

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
about a person

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
can be collected,

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
but it will be expensive and meaningless.

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
You can collect information

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
about the coffee service

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
in the kitchen

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
and what is the name of your favorite dog.

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
From the point of view of security

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
for the organization,

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
the circle of questions

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
and answers is determined.

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
This is all about

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
objective data.

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
Objective data

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
can be obtained

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
by means of documents

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
that a person presents.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
For example, a passport,

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
driver's license,

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
education documents, etc.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
Objective data

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
can be collected

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
by means of a questionnaire

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
that a person fills out.

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
This is a normal practice

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
when a person

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
fills out a questionnaire.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
Try to make the questionnaire

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
well-composed.

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
This is the information

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
that a person provides about himself

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
and which you want to receive

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
directly from a person.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
Usually, it consists of several sheets

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
and many questions are discussed there,

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
including financial obligations

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
that a person has.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
It is clear that if a person

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
pays a loan

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
for some mortgage

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
more than you will pay per month,

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
then the question arises

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
where he gets the money.

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
In this questionnaire,

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
when you form it,

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
make sure that

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
the person gave you this information

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
voluntarily and does not object

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
to checking the information.

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
The person must sign it.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
Keep in mind that there is an article

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
on dismissal of a person

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
under the Labor Code

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000
for false information.

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
What information is collected?

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
Information on violations

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
and crimes.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
You are interested in

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
whether a person was ever

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000
involved in administrative

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
violations or crimes.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
It is clear whether a person

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
was ever involved in criminal crimes.

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
Whether he was on the wanted list,

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000
whether he was a criminal,

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
and so on.

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000
Again,

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
it is not necessarily

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.000
bad, it is definitely good.

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
However,

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:38.000
if you take a driver

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
and see that he was involved

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
10 times in violation of the speed limit,

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
2 times in the abuse

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
of alcohol,

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000
then it is clear

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000
that it is better not to take such a driver.

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:56.000
I am saying that a smart person

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000
will not be caught.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
He is punished for what?

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.000
Not for what he did,

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.000
but for what he got caught.

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000
Therefore, it is better not to take people

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.000
for criminal responsibility

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000
or for administrative violations.

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:12.000
Although all this is very individual

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
and subjective.

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000
First, we look at the direction

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.000
in which we collect information.

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000
Financial obligations.

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000
I have already said

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
financial obligations.

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:28.000
Now, unfortunately,

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:30.000
very common,

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.000
unfortunately,

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
fortunately,

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
are loans,

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
consumer loans,

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000
mortgages, and so on.

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000
This is not good

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000
from the point of view of security.

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.000
If a person has accumulated a huge amount

03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000
of financial obligations,

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:50.000
it is clear that he must pay.

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000
He can commit illegal actions

03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000
precisely because he has nothing to return.

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:00.000
Let's say,

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000
a connection with competitors.

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
It is clear that you are interested

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000
whether this Cossack is not sent

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
and whether he is not satisfied

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:12.000
with your organization,

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
with some illegal goals

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000
that his competitors

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000
have set up.

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:24.000
They look at the connection

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.000
with the organization of crime.

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
With the organization of crime.

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000
Again, from the point of view

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
of the threat that this person poses

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000
if he has some kind of

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000
extensive connection with the organization of crime.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000
It can be both a threat and not a threat.

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
Again, this information is simply collected.

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
Then it must be analyzed

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:48.000
and some decisions are made.

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000
It is analyzed from the point of view

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000
of some amoral actions.

03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.000
Amoral actions.

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000
The concept of amoral actions

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
is quite subjective.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000
But, as a rule,

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
there is a classical approach,

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.000
a classical interpretation of these things.

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:10.000
It is related to drunkenness,

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:12.000
to some unmarried relationships

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000
and everything else.

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:20.000
The connection is analyzed

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
with some organizations.

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000
It can be the most diverse organization.

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000
Good or bad organizations.

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000
Of course, from the point of view

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000
of threats.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
If you take a person

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000
and you get information

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000
that he is connected

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000
with some nationalist movements,

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:46.000
with the Kinheads,

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.000
with something else.

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000
Why do you need extra problems?

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.000
Here, from the point of view

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:54.000
of some religious views,

03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:56.000
it is evaluated

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.000
from the classical point of view

03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000
of religion, it is good.

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000
As a rule, people do not

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:04.000
commit any illegal actions.

03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.000
Although there are some religious

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:08.000
movements that can harm

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:10.000
your company.

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000
It is analyzed

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000
from the point of view

03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:20.000
of a person's psychological features.

03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.000
Psychological features.

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.000
I have already talked about them

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:30.000
when I talked about the relationship

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.000
between work and psychologists.

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:34.000
Relative relationships are analyzed.

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:44.000
Under the relative relationship

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.000
you can include many things.

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:48.000
This is the relationship

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:50.000
between fathers and children.

03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:52.000
This is the relationship

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:54.000
in the family, where parents work,

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:56.000
where the wife works, where the children work.

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000
In general, the relationship in the family

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000
is based on the fact

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.000
that a person is in the stage of divorce.

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.000
He is very worried.

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.000
It is clear that in the near future

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:10.000
he will not be a worker

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.000
because this fact of divorce

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000
can have a very strong effect on him.

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000
What is analyzed?

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:28.000
The work in the past.

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:48.000
From the point of view of committing

03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:50.000
any illegal actions,

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000
the reason for the dismissal is analyzed.

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.000
In the vast majority of cases

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:56.000
in the employment book

03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.000
they write quite classic things

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000
related to the departure

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000
at will or by agreement of the parties.

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000
90% of dismissals

03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000
are based on these articles.

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.000
The security service

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.000
must understand the real reason

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000
for the dismissal.

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000
A person can commit

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.000
some illegal actions.

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000
The company does not want to quarrel with him.

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.000
To clarify the relationship,

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:22.000
the company must write a statement

03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:24.000
and leave.

03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000
In fact, the person left

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:28.000
because he was kicked out.

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000
The material situation is analyzed.

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000
The material situation is analyzed

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000
from the point of view of the ratio

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.000
of the material situation

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:52.000
and the positions of the person.

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.000
If it is clear,

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.000
the material situation

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:58.000
corresponds to the positions

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.000
of the person

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.000
in various organizations.

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000
When a person worked

03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000
in low-level organizations,

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.000
in low-level positions,

03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.000
and has a very serious

03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:12.000
material situation,

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000
the question arises why.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000
There is a concept

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000
of a rastro sign of danger.

03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:20.000
It is necessary to understand

03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:22.000
why this happens.

03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:24.000
There is a rastro sign of danger.

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:26.000
There is some kind of

03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:28.000
mismatch and illogicity

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:30.000
of the situation.

03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.000
It is possible to analyze

03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:40.000
the number of connections

03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:42.000
with the administrative resource,

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.000
connections with some organizations,

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.000
the ability of this person,

03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:48.000
and so on.

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:50.000
The level of information

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:52.000
collected by a person

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:54.000
depends on

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.000
the position of this person.

03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000
It is clear that if you take

03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000
a person to a position of a loader,

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000
you may be interested

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:04.000
only in a very small amount

03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:06.000
of information about this person.

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.000
If you take a person to a position of a top manager,

03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:10.000
there is a more serious level

03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:12.000
of information collection

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:14.000
and verification.

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:16.000
If we talk about

03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:18.000
channels of information collection,

03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:24.000
what methods of collection are there?

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:28.000
I have already said that

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:30.000
methods are limited

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:32.000
to such concepts as personal data.

03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:34.000
Basically,

03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:36.000
it is what a person

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:38.000
reports himself

03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:40.000
on the resume,

03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:42.000
on the interviews,

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.000
on the objective materials

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000
that he brings,

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:48.000
such as documents,

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:50.000
passport,

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.000
employment certificate,

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:54.000
and so on.

03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.000
Getting information

03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.000
on the Internet,

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.000
that is, having typed the last name

03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:04.000
of a person in various

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:06.000
search engines of the Internet,

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:08.000
you can understand or get

03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:10.000
some information about this person.

03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:12.000
In particular,

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:14.000
educational schools

03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:16.000
often make graduates of a certain year

03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:18.000
with photos,

03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:20.000
surnames,

03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.000
and the person's

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:24.000
face and school

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:26.000
where he graduated.

03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:28.000
This is a real experience.

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:30.000
It is impossible to hide

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:32.000
the year and the school he graduated from.

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.000
Just typing his last name and his school

03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:36.000
is enough to hide the year.

03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:38.000
Using various databases.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:42.000
Unfortunately,

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000
there are a lot of such databases.

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.000
Unfortunately or fortunately,

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:48.000
illegal, semi-underground databases

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:50.000
can be supplied on the Internet

03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:52.000
and sold on the markets.

03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.000
Unfortunately, this is an objective reality.

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000
Our personal data

03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:00.000
is not well protected.

03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:02.000
Security services often use

03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:04.000
these databases.

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:06.000
It is necessary to assume that

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.000
this is not legal information,

03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:10.000
it can be cut off,

03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:12.000
it can be incomplete.

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:14.000
At least, if a person

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.000
comes to you to work,

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:18.000
he is identified by the database

03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:20.000
of a lost passport,

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.000
at least he should be guarded.

03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:24.000
If he does not go through

03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:26.000
any database,

03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:28.000
it does not mean that he is white and fluffy.

03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:30.000
It means that you need to dig deeper.

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:34.000
It can be

03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:36.000
a trip to the workplace,

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:38.000
a conversation with people

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:40.000
with whom he used to work

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000
or with whom he used to contact.

03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:50.000
There are other options.

03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:52.000
You can make inquiries

03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:54.000
to the educational institutions

03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:56.000
where he graduated from.

03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:58.000
It is necessary to assume that

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.000
no one is obliged to answer these inquiries.

03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:02.000
This is about the reception.

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:04.000
If, from the point of view of the security service,

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:06.000
a person is not a threat,

03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:08.000
then usually it is a questionnaire

03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:10.000
that is filled by the person.

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:12.000
The head of the security service

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:14.000
signs that he does not object.

03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:16.000
If he objects,

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:18.000
then this candidate does not need

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:20.000
to explain anything.

03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:22.000
Nothing is officially written.

03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:24.000
The leadership of the company

03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:26.000
says that, in their opinion,

03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:28.000
these are the reasons

03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:30.000
why they do not recommend

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:32.000
hiring this person.

03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:34.000
However, I say again

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:36.000
that this is not an official reason for refusal.

03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:38.000
Therefore, official papers are not written.

03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:40.000
This is all about

03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:42.000
the reception at work.

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:44.000
As for the dismissal,

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:46.000
I will write a little here.

03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:50.000
The dismissal of employees.

03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:52.000
The security service also

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.000
widely applies

03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:56.000
the reasons

03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000
for dismissal.

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:00.000
Of course, it is necessary

03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:02.000
to look at the level

03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:04.000
of the person who is dismissed.

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:06.000
Basically,

03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:08.000
what is applied

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:10.000
and what is recommended.

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:12.000
It is necessary to find out

03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:14.000
the real reasons for dismissal.

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:16.000
This is a very important point.

03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:18.000
The reason for dismissal

03:21:18.000 --> 03:21:20.000
is not a person's

03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.000
personality.

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:24.000
The real reasons for dismissal

03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:26.000
are the following.

03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:28.000
One thing is that he found a job

03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:30.000
closer to home and paid more.

03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:32.000
This is one thing.

03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:34.000
If he leaves because

03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:36.000
he is being eaten up by the team,

03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:38.000
the moral and psychological climate,

03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:40.000
or maybe he leaves because

03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:42.000
he did something and is trying

03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:44.000
to replace the traces,

03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:46.000
this is completely different.

03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:48.000
The real reasons for dismissal are

03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:50.000
trying to find out

03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:52.000
the future job.

03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.000
The amount of information

03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000
of this person is known.

03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:58.000
I have already said

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:00.000
that it is necessary

03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:02.000
to start from the worst.

03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:04.000
The worst thing

03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:06.000
is that the person

03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:08.000
can tell everything

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.000
he knows.

03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:12.000
For money or not,

03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.000
this is another question.

03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:16.000
Unfortunately, it is objective reality

03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:18.000
that he can tell everything.

03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:20.000
Therefore, as a rule,

03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:22.000
everything that a person knows

03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:24.000
comes from the worst.

03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:26.000
The risks associated

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:28.000
with the disclosure of this information

03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:30.000
are minimized.

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.000
The activity in the unit

03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:36.000
from which a person leaves

03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:38.000
is analyzed.

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:40.000
Was there any problem

03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:42.000
associated with some kind of disappearance,

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.000
loss, theft, and so on?

03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:46.000
Again, this is a reason

03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:48.000
why a person is dismissed.

03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:50.000
He wants to replace some traces.

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.000
The instruction to a person

03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:54.000
who is dismissed

03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:56.000
is related to

03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:58.000
trying to convince

03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:00.000
a person

03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:02.000
to not disclose

03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:04.000
the information

03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:06.000
he knew

03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:08.000
in the past.

03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:10.000
This is a very difficult

03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:12.000
and necessary

03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.000
instruction.

03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:16.000
He should not

03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:18.000
do

03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:20.000
any illegal

03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:22.000
actions

03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:24.000
after dismissal.

03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:26.000
Here is an interesting experience

03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:28.000
of Americans.

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:30.000
They pay money

03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:32.000
to a person

03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:34.000
to keep commercial secrets.

03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:36.000
A person is dismissed.

03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:38.000
He is obliged

03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:40.000
not to disclose

03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:42.000
the commercial secrets

03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:44.000
and to pay a certain amount of money

03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:46.000
to keep it.

03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:48.000
If there are any problems

03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:50.000
associated with disclosure,

03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:52.000
he loses some money

03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:54.000
as a bonus.

03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:56.000
This experience is not widely used

03:23:56.000 --> 03:23:58.000
in Russian companies.

03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:00.000
However, it is not prohibited.

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:02.000
It can be done without any problems.

03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:06.000
To inform

03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:08.000
the employees

03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:10.000
who work with a person

03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:12.000
that he is dismissed

03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:14.000
and he is dismissed

03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:16.000
and that he does not work

03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:18.000
with us anymore.

03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:20.000
If you want to contact him,

03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:22.000
you can.

03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:24.000
No one forbids you

03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.000
to drink vodka with him.

03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:28.000
However, it is not allowed

03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:30.000
to disclose confidential information.

03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:32.000
A company's agents

03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:34.000
are informed

03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:36.000
that this person

03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:38.000
does not work

03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:40.000
with this company anymore.

03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:42.000
A person can be

03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:44.000
informed that

03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:46.000
this person

03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:48.000
does not work with this company anymore.

03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:50.000
They can disclose some information

03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:52.000
and do some actions

03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:54.000
because they remember

03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:56.000
that this person

03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:58.000
worked with them.

03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:00.000
It is necessary to check

03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:02.000
that a person did not take

03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:04.000
any databases,

03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:06.000
any electronic devices,

03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:08.000
any access codes,

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:10.000
any passwords,

03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000
any cryptos, etc.

03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:14.000
Usually,

03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:16.000
the environment

03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.000
in which this person

03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.000
was in contact

03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:22.000
is analyzed.

03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:24.000
It means that the employees

03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:26.000
of the company

03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:28.000
who worked with him

03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:30.000
were in close relations.

03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:32.000
It can be a friendship,

03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:34.000
a love relationship,

03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:36.000
or a relationship

03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:38.000
with a company.

03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:40.000
The approach to these people

03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:42.000
is a certain work.

03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:44.000
It is mainly

03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:46.000
preventive measures.

03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:48.000
If a person wants

03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:50.000
to get information,

03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:52.000
he will contact

03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:54.000
the people

03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:56.000
he used to be in close relations with.

03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:58.000
Then there is an instruction

03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:00.000
not to disclose

03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:02.000
any information.

03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:04.000
I would like to add

03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:06.000
that the responsibility

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:08.000
of the employees

03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:10.000
of the company

03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.000
for various illegal actions

03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:14.000
is related to this.

03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:16.000
The list of illegal actions

03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.000
can be very long.

03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:20.000
The responsibility

03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:22.000
can be different.

03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:24.000
I will focus on one problem

03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:26.000
that is related to the person,

03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:28.000
to the work of the security service

03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:30.000
and to the personnel

03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:32.000
of the company.

03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:34.000
It is the disclosure

03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:36.000
of information

03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:38.000
that is a commercial secret.

03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:40.000
What can be done

03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:42.000
with a person

03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:44.000
who disclosed

03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:46.000
commercial secrets?

03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:48.000
The responsibility can be different.

03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:50.000
I will try to write it down.

03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:52.000
Here is a situation.

03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:54.000
One of the situations

03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:56.000
is the disclosure

03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:58.000
of information

03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:00.000
that is a commercial secret.

03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:02.000
I will call it KT.

03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.000
It is a classic abbreviation.

03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:06.000
It is a commercial secret.

03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:08.000
What responsibility

03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:10.000
does a person

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:12.000
who disclosed a commercial secret have?

03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:14.000
The responsibility can be different.

03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:16.000
The simplest thing

03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:18.000
that can be done

03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000
and is quite realistic

03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:22.000
is disciplinary responsibility.

03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:24.000
Disciplinary responsibility.

03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:34.000
Here we need

03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:36.000
to start from different points.

03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:38.000
There is a concept

03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:40.000
of a commercial secret regime.

03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:42.000
A commercial secret regime

03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:44.000
is created at the enterprise.

03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:46.000
It assumes certain actions of the employee.

03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:48.000
In case of violation of the employee's norms

03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:50.000
and requirements,

03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:52.000
he can be brought to disciplinary responsibility.

03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:54.000
According to the Labor Code,

03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:56.000
it is a complaint,

03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:58.000
a reprimand.

03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:00.000
Here we are not talking

03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:02.000
about the disclosure of a commercial secret.

03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:04.000
The information has not gone anywhere,

03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:06.000
no damage has been done,

03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:08.000
but for the violation of the commercial secret regime.

03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:10.000
It is used very simply,

03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:12.000
very easily and quite calmly.

03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:14.000
The most important thing is

03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:16.000
that the commercial secret regime was created

03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:18.000
and that the employees

03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:20.000
knew what it consisted of

03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:22.000
and knew their responsibilities

03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:24.000
within the framework of the commercial secret regime.

03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:28.000
It can be

03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:30.000
disciplinary prosecution,

03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:38.000
it can be a deprivation of bonus,

03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:40.000
it can be a reprimand,

03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:42.000
it can be a complaint,

03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:44.000
and so on.

03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:46.000
It can be a dismissal.

03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:50.000
A dismissal

03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:52.000
can also be a disciplinary prosecution.

03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:54.000
Nevertheless,

03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:56.000
in the Labor Code,

03:28:56.000 --> 03:28:58.000
both in the old,

03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:00.000
the new and the completely new,

03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:02.000
it is prescribed.

03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:04.000
For the disclosure of a secret

03:29:04.000 --> 03:29:06.000
by the law,

03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:08.000
various types of secrets are listed,

03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:10.000
including the commercial secret.

03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:12.000
The employee can be fired.

03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:14.000
This is a dismissal

03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:16.000
on the initiative of the employer.

03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:18.000
I have never encountered

03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:20.000
a person being fired on this article.

03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:22.000
For various reasons.

03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:24.000
First, you need to have very strong

03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:26.000
evidence of the person's guilt

03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:28.000
to fire him on this article.

03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:30.000
Because a person can

03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:32.000
appeal to court after a while.

03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:34.000
In our case, the court usually

03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:36.000
stands on the side of the employee,

03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:38.000
not on the side of the employer.

03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:40.000
And the employer will need

03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:42.000
to have very strong evidence

03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:44.000
why the person was fired on this article.

03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:46.000
I have no idea

03:29:46.000 --> 03:29:48.000
where a person can go

03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:50.000
if he was fired

03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:52.000
on the basis of a commercial secret.

03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:54.000
If it is a record

03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:56.000
of a labor book,

03:29:56.000 --> 03:29:58.000
then it is a wolf's ticket

03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:00.000
that the person will not go anywhere.

03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:02.000
Therefore, I would not recommend

03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:04.000
to abuse this.

03:30:04.000 --> 03:30:06.000
And usually, if it is a disclosure of information,

03:30:06.000 --> 03:30:08.000
people still go to other articles.

03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:10.000
The classic option is

03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:12.000
either consent of the parties

03:30:12.000 --> 03:30:14.000
or a disclosure of information

03:30:14.000 --> 03:30:16.000
on their own will.

03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:18.000
Nevertheless, if a person has already

03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:20.000
disclosed all the secrets,

03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:22.000
then he can be fired.

03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:24.000
This is the kind of article

03:30:24.000 --> 03:30:26.000
that exists.

03:30:26.000 --> 03:30:28.000
What else is the responsibility?

03:30:28.000 --> 03:30:30.000
There is a property responsibility.

03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:32.000
There is a property responsibility.

03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:44.000
According to our legislation,

03:30:44.000 --> 03:30:46.000
that is, according to the law

03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:48.000
on commercial secrecy

03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:50.000
and according to the Civil Code,

03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:56.000
there is a full property responsibility

03:30:56.000 --> 03:30:58.000
for the damage

03:30:58.000 --> 03:31:00.000
caused by the disclosure of a commercial secret.

03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:02.000
However, it is necessary to assume

03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:04.000
that it is quite difficult

03:31:04.000 --> 03:31:06.000
to prove and to investigate

03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:08.000
because everything that concerns

03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:10.000
the damage caused by the disclosure

03:31:10.000 --> 03:31:12.000
of a commercial secret is usually a lost benefit.

03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:14.000
There is a real damage,

03:31:14.000 --> 03:31:16.000
there is a lost benefit.

03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:18.000
The real damage

03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:20.000
is usually very minimal.

03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:24.000
It can be the cost of a piece of paper

03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:26.000
that was taken out of the enterprise

03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:28.000
and a formula was written on it.

03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:30.000
The real damage can be a penny.

03:31:30.000 --> 03:31:32.000
Everything else is, in fact,

03:31:32.000 --> 03:31:34.000
a lost benefit.

03:31:34.000 --> 03:31:36.000
The contracts, contracts,

03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:38.000
agreements are broken, and everything else.

03:31:38.000 --> 03:31:40.000
It is almost impossible

03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:42.000
to compensate for a lost benefit

03:31:42.000 --> 03:31:44.000
according to our judicial system.

03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:48.000
Therefore, it is necessary to assume

03:31:48.000 --> 03:31:50.000
that if the information has leaked,

03:31:50.000 --> 03:31:52.000
then, as a rule,

03:31:52.000 --> 03:31:54.000
all that concerns the property responsibility

03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:56.000
is very difficult to implement.

03:31:56.000 --> 03:31:58.000
Therefore, everything that concerns

03:31:58.000 --> 03:32:00.000
the protection of information,

03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:02.000
including that of a person,

03:32:02.000 --> 03:32:04.000
must be done in advance.

03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:06.000
As soon as this happens,

03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:08.000
it is already quite difficult

03:32:08.000 --> 03:32:10.000
to do anything.

03:32:10.000 --> 03:32:12.000
Although, according to the law,

03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:14.000
property responsibility is provided.

03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:16.000
There is criminal liability.

03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:20.000
Criminal liability.

03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:26.000
Criminal liability is provided

03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:28.000
for disclosure of commercial secrets.

03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:30.000
Keep in mind

03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:32.000
that this is a criminal act.

03:32:32.000 --> 03:32:34.000
This is a crime.

03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:36.000
Disclosure of commercial secrets

03:32:36.000 --> 03:32:38.000
to the company's employees

03:32:38.000 --> 03:32:40.000
is a crime,

03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:42.000
not even a violation of the law.

03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:44.000
This is not administrative liability,

03:32:44.000 --> 03:32:46.000
but criminal liability.

03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:48.000
Although there are a lot of subtleties

03:32:48.000 --> 03:32:50.000
and nuances here.

03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:52.000
This is an article

03:32:52.000 --> 03:32:54.000
This is an article

03:32:54.000 --> 03:32:56.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code.

03:32:56.000 --> 03:32:58.000
It has a certain feature.

03:32:58.000 --> 03:33:00.000
It is basically applied,

03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:02.000
but in some situations

03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:04.000
it is very difficult.

03:33:04.000 --> 03:33:06.000
I will try to explain these things now.

03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:08.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code

03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:10.000
of the Russian Federation

03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:12.000
In order to understand

03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:14.000
why Article 183 of the Criminal Code

03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:16.000
consists of such a large number of articles,

03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:18.000
I will explain it to you.

03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:20.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code

03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:22.000
Although Article 183 of the Criminal Code

03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:24.000
consists of four parts,

03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:26.000
it is necessary to understand

03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:28.000
how the disclosure of commercial secrets

03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:30.000
to the enterprise takes place.

03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:32.000
Basically, the disclosure goes

03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:34.000
I will try to draw here

03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:36.000
The disclosure goes

03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:38.000
through

03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:40.000
through

03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:42.000
through

03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:44.000
through

03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:46.000
through

03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:48.000
through

03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:50.000
through

03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:52.000
through

03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:54.000
through

03:33:54.000 --> 03:33:56.000
your own

03:33:56.000 --> 03:33:58.000
through your own

03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:00.000
through your own

03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:02.000
through others

03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:04.000
through your own

03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:06.000
That is, you entrusted your

03:34:06.000 --> 03:34:08.000
commercial secrets to the employee

03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:10.000
within the framework of

03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:12.000
the fulfillment of your

03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:14.000
official duties.

03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:16.000
He works with your

03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:18.000
own.

03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:20.000
Therefore, as a rule, all the work

03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:22.000
on the protection of

03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:24.000
disclosure of commercial secrets

03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:26.000
through your own, it goes

03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:28.000
through the motivation of the staff,

03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:30.000
that is, so that the person does not want to

03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:32.000
disclose the commercial secrets.

03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:34.000
If he wants to disclose them,

03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:36.000
well, as a rule, he will disclose them.

03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:38.000
That is, it must be done so that he does not want to do it.

03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:40.000
So, disclosure through others

03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:42.000
is, let's call it

03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:44.000
disclosure through people

03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:46.000
who did not trust your commercial secrets.

03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:48.000
That is, you do not give them access.

03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:50.000
But they, having hacked some of your

03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:52.000
protection funds, they got access to this information.

03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:54.000
And basically everything

03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:56.000
regarding the mechanism, algorithm,

03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:58.000
let's say, protection of commercial secret

03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:00.000
is, as a rule, protection

03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:02.000
from strangers, not from their own, but from strangers.

03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:04.000
So,

03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:06.000
based on this, I will just try

03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:08.000
to draw why

03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:10.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code

03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:12.000
consists of four

03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:14.000
parts and why

03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:16.000
some parts are used, and some

03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:18.000
parts are practically not used.

03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:20.000
So, the first part

03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:22.000
of this article

03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:24.000
183 of the Criminal Code,

03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:26.000
I will just read it a little more thoroughly.

03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:28.000
For collecting information

03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:30.000
consisting of commercial or bank secrets

03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:32.000
by stealing documents, bribery

03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:34.000
or threat, in an equally

03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:36.000
illegal way in order to disclose

03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:38.000
or illegally use this information,

03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:40.000
a fine of up to 80 thousand rubles is provided

03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:42.000
or a fine of up to 6 months

03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:44.000
for the amount of the income of the convict,

03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:46.000
or a term of up to 2 years for deprivation of freedom.

03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.000
So, what is the first part?

03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:50.000
First of all,

03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:52.000
let's draw it like this,

03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000
it is protection from strangers.

03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:58.000
So,

03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:00.000
these are some people

03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:02.000
whom you did not trust

03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:04.000
with your commercial secrets,

03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:06.000
they committed some illegal actions.

03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:08.000
Here, some illegal actions

03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:10.000
are listed,

03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:12.000
such as stealing documents, bribery, threat,

03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:14.000
in an equally illegal way.

03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:16.000
Here, as a rule,

03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:18.000
it is easy to prove.

03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:20.000
Easy to prove.

03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:22.000
That is,

03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:24.000
the illegal way is easy enough

03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:26.000
to prove, because it usually

03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:28.000
leaves certain traces.

03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:30.000
Here,

03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:32.000
what is good in this part,

03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:34.000
the first one,

03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:36.000
is that there is no connection with damage.

03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:40.000
No connection with damage.

03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:42.000
That is,

03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000
a person can break

03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.000
some of your access systems,

03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:48.000
steal commercial secrets,

03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:50.000
not to sell them to anyone,

03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:52.000
that is, no damage has been done,

03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:54.000
the information has not gone anywhere

03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:56.000
further, the criminal has not gone.

03:36:56.000 --> 03:36:58.000
All crimes are already considered legal,

03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:00.000
and, in principle, you can bring to justice

03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:02.000
in a day the responsibility for part 1 of this 183 article.

03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.000
Here.

03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:08.000
Well,

03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:10.000
let's say,

03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:12.000
all that follows from this is a fine

03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:14.000
and up to 2 years.

03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:18.000
This is the part that actually works,

03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:20.000
which is applied, although

03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:22.000
everything is limited by fines.

03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:24.000
As far as I know,

03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:26.000
the deprivation of freedom

03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:28.000
if there were, then only conditionally.

03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:30.000
But, nevertheless, this is the part that

03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:32.000
is applied and which can really

03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:34.000
work.

03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:36.000
The second, third, and fourth part

03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:38.000
is, in general, protection from your own.

03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:40.000
The second part of this

03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:42.000
183 article.

03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:48.000
Illegal disclosure or use of information

03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:50.000
that constitutes a commercial tax

03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:52.000
or a bank secret without the

03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:54.000
consent of the owner of the person

03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:56.000
to whom it was known or became known

03:37:56.000 --> 03:37:58.000
by service or work is punished

03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:00.000
by a fine of up to 120 thousand rubles

03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:02.000
or in terms of salary or new income

03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:04.000
of the defendant for a period of up to

03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:06.000
one year with the deprivation of the right

03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:08.000
to occupy a certain position or to engage

03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:10.000
in a certain activity for a period of up to

03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:12.000
three years or deprivation of freedom

03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:14.000
for a period of up to three years.

03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:16.000
So, this part,

03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:18.000
in fact, is protection

03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:20.000
from your own.

03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:22.000
From your own.

03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:24.000
That is, you entrusted a person

03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:26.000
with your commercial secrets,

03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:28.000
he took on the obligation to keep

03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:30.000
your commercial secrets, but, let's say,

03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:32.000
somewhere he talked, somewhere he told,

03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:36.000
and there was a leak

03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:38.000
of confidential information.

03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:40.000
So, here

03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:42.000
what else is there to talk about?

03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:44.000
Again, there is no connection

03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:46.000
with damage.

03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:54.000
That is, it is not tied to the fact

03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:56.000
that there must be a certain damage.

03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:58.000
That is, we are talking about the very fact

03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:00.000
that we are keeping the commercial secrets,

03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:02.000
the disclosure, we are keeping the confidential laws.

03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:04.000
And here,

03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:06.000
what else is special?

03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:08.000
There is usually no mind.

03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:12.000
Why not? Because the next part

03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:14.000
is just about those situations

03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:16.000
when the mind already exists.

03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:18.000
And if you write the first part

03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:20.000
further, you can say

03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:22.000
that there is always a mind.

03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:26.000
Because, let's say,

03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:28.000
blackmail, bribery,

03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:30.000
hacking of some safes, threats,

03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:32.000
they usually do not exist without mind.

03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:34.000
So, the second part

03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:36.000
is that there is no mind.

03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:38.000
That is, you can attract a person

03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:40.000
to this part when, as a rule,

03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:42.000
when he accidentally disclosed

03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:44.000
the commercial secrets.

03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:46.000
That is, he has no mind,

03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:48.000
no interest.

03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:50.000
I already gave this example at the beginning,

03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:52.000
when you bring the person you need

03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:54.000
to a restaurant, give him a drink,

03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:56.000
and he will tell you about the commercial secrets.

03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:58.000
Yes, this is already a criminal act,

03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:00.000
but there is no mind here,

03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:02.000
so it is about the second part,

03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:04.000
Article 183.

03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:06.000
And if we talk

03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:08.000
in response,

03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:10.000
all these fines are clear,

03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:12.000
and if we talk about the deprivation of freedom,

03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:14.000
up to three years.

03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:16.000
So, the third part

03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:20.000
of Article 183

03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:22.000
is also a defense against one's own.

03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:24.000
The same actions

03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:26.000
that have caused major damage

03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:28.000
or committed out of interest

03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:30.000
are punished with a fine of up to 200,000 rubles

03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:32.000
or in the amount of salary

03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:34.000
or income of the defendant

03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:36.000
for a period of up to 18 months

03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:38.000
with the deprivation of the right

03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:40.000
to occupy a certain position

03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:42.000
or to engage in a certain activity

03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:44.000
for a period of up to three years

03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:46.000
or deprivation of freedom

03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:48.000
for a period of up to five years.

03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:50.000
So, what is the feature here?

03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:52.000
The defense against one's own.

03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:56.000
The defense against one's own.

03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:00.000
So, there is a connection

03:41:00.000 --> 03:41:02.000
with damage.

03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:04.000
There should be major damage.

03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:10.000
Major damage

03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:12.000
or out of interest.

03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:14.000
Out of interest.

03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:22.000
Out of interest.

03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:24.000
There should be a certain intention.

03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:28.000
Roughly speaking,

03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:30.000
if a person gives information

03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:32.000
and gets a monetary reward

03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:34.000
in return,

03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:36.000
it falls under the third part

03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:38.000
of Article 183.

03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:42.000
And here,

03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:46.000
what else

03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:48.000
I could say?

03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:50.000
I would like to emphasize

03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:52.000
that this is evidence.

03:41:54.000 --> 03:41:56.000
As a rule,

03:41:56.000 --> 03:41:58.000
everything related to evidence

03:41:58.000 --> 03:42:00.000
in this article

03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:02.000
is carried out in such a way

03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:04.000
that the evidence is not visible

03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:06.000
or, as a rule,

03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:08.000
it is of interest.

03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:10.000
So, what are the options?

03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:12.000
The security service

03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:14.000
has information

03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:16.000
that they want to get

03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:18.000
the commercial secrets.

03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:20.000
The security service

03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:22.000
may have different activities.

03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:24.000
It may be some kind of

03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:26.000
preventive conversation.

03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:28.000
What can be more serious?

03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:32.000
We do everything

03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:34.000
to get it to the court.

03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:36.000
This is also a certain installation,

03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:38.000
a certain decision.

03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:40.000
Then this person is given

03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:42.000
to get the commercial secrets.

03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:44.000
He is not detained at the checkpoint.

03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:46.000
The security service

03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:48.000
is not detained at the checkpoint.

03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:50.000
All the evidence is not refutable.

03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:52.000
All this is recorded on video,

03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:54.000
on audio.

03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:56.000
All this becomes evidence of the basis.

03:42:56.000 --> 03:42:58.000
Some kind of interest

03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:00.000
is traced here.

03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:04.000
The fourth part

03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.000
of Article 183

03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:12.000
is also protection

03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:14.000
from one's own.

03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.000
It is about the same actions

03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:18.000
as part 2 or 3

03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:20.000
of the current article,

03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:22.000
which have serious consequences

03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:24.000
and punish with a free sentence

03:43:24.000 --> 03:43:26.000
up to 10 years.

03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:28.000
This is protection from one's own.

03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:34.000
And this should be

03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:36.000
serious consequences.

03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:42.000
Well,

03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:44.000
serious consequences

03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:46.000
when the commercial secret is disclosed

03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:48.000
is a rare phenomenon.

03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:50.000
Here it is up to 5 years.

03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:56.000
Although it can be assumed

03:43:56.000 --> 03:43:58.000
that the serious consequences

03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:00.000
are all that is related to death.

03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:02.000
These are the things.

03:44:04.000 --> 03:44:06.000
If it happened,

03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:08.000
then up to 10 years.

03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:12.000
In practice,

03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:14.000
part 1 is used,

03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:16.000
part 3 is used.

03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:18.000
When there is a good interest,

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000
it is usually done

03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:22.000
so that the evidence

03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:24.000
for the court is not refutable.

03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:26.000
Part 4 and 2 are used very rarely.

03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:28.000
Unfortunately,

03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:30.000
it is used quite difficultly.

03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:34.000
At least this is one of the cases

03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:36.000
in one of the directions.

03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:38.000
Responsibility of the company's employees

03:44:38.000 --> 03:44:40.000
is a very important issue.

03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:42.000
What can be done

03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:44.000
to prevent certain illegal actions?

03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:46.000
In particular,

03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:48.000
we have considered the issue

03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:50.000
of the disclosure of commercial secrets.

03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:52.000


03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:55.760


03:44:55.760 --> 03:45:02.200
The next topic, the next block that we will consider is information security.

03:45:02.200 --> 03:45:10.000
Information security, I have already said, is a state of security of information resources of a company

03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:19.680
achieved by means of a set of measures, I draw your attention to the set of measures, aimed at the protection of information.

03:45:19.680 --> 03:45:29.680
If we are writing down information resources, here is the information,

03:45:29.680 --> 03:45:43.680
it is divided into two large groups, these are open information resources,

03:45:43.680 --> 03:45:56.680
that is, information resources that have no access restrictions.

03:45:56.680 --> 03:46:01.680
As a rule, it is regulated by the law on the means of mass information,

03:46:01.680 --> 03:46:09.680
and everything that concerns open information resources is not subject to information security.

03:46:10.680 --> 03:46:14.680
And this is an information resource with limited access.

03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:24.680
Let's call it that way, information with limited access.

03:46:24.680 --> 03:46:32.680
Information with limited access is divided into two large groups,

03:46:32.680 --> 03:46:47.680
this is state secret, this is confidential information.

03:46:47.680 --> 03:46:57.680
Confidential information.

03:46:57.680 --> 03:47:03.680
This is at the level of state information resources.

03:47:03.680 --> 03:47:07.680
State secret is clear, there is a law on state secrets,

03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:11.680
certain licenses are required, certain rules must be observed,

03:47:11.680 --> 03:47:15.680
this is not a subject of our classes, our seminars.

03:47:15.680 --> 03:47:17.680
Confidential information.

03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:19.680
What is confidential information?

03:47:19.680 --> 03:47:27.680
There is a presidential decree, 188, on the approval of the list of confidential information,

03:47:27.680 --> 03:47:31.680
where it is written what confidential information is.

03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:36.680
What is confidential information?

03:47:36.680 --> 03:47:44.680
The first is personal data.

03:47:44.680 --> 03:47:50.680
This is information about the facts, events and circumstances in a citizen's private life,

03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:52.680
which allows you to identify his personality.

03:47:52.680 --> 03:47:59.680
Just six months ago, the law on personal data was introduced,

03:47:59.680 --> 03:48:05.680
where the rules of the game are prescribed on the market of personal data.

03:48:05.680 --> 03:48:11.680
Personal data is protected,

03:48:11.680 --> 03:48:17.680
and those organizations that face personal data must protect personal data.

03:48:17.680 --> 03:48:21.680
In principle, any employer faces personal data,

03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:27.680
so any employer must take measures to protect personal data of its employees.

03:48:27.680 --> 03:48:35.680
There are articles in the Labor Code on personal data,

03:48:35.680 --> 03:48:39.680
or rather on the protection of personal data of the employer.

03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:47.680
Unfortunately, we must note that personal data is not well protected,

03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:53.680
so a large number of personal data in semi-legal form is presented on the market

03:48:53.680 --> 03:48:57.680
as part of some kind of personal data.

03:48:57.680 --> 03:48:59.680
Nevertheless, this is an objective reality,

03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:03.680
and I think that in time, order will be established here.

03:49:03.680 --> 03:49:05.680
What is it?

03:49:05.680 --> 03:49:13.680
This is a commercial secret.

03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:19.680
I will talk about the commercial secret in more detail later.

03:49:19.680 --> 03:49:25.680
There is a commercial secret law,

03:49:25.680 --> 03:49:33.680
that is, there are rules of the game regarding how the commercial secret should be kept.

03:49:33.680 --> 03:49:41.680
It should be borne in mind that any commercial structure can have a commercial secret.

03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:45.680
This is legal information that represents a commercial value,

03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:51.680
and this information can be in the company.

03:49:51.680 --> 03:49:57.680
The next one is the so-called service secret.

03:49:57.680 --> 03:50:05.680
This is a service secret.

03:50:05.680 --> 03:50:11.680
There is a concept of a service secret,

03:50:11.680 --> 03:50:17.680
but unfortunately, there is no law on the service secret at the legislative level,

03:50:17.680 --> 03:50:23.680
so you can only guess what a service secret is.

03:50:23.680 --> 03:50:27.680
In fact, this is information of state bodies,

03:50:27.680 --> 03:50:31.680
which are subject to the closure of state bodies,

03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:33.680
but do not fall under the regime of the state secret.

03:50:33.680 --> 03:50:39.680
In a simplified version, this is the so-called DSP bar for service use.

03:50:39.680 --> 03:50:45.680
As a rule, the service secret is related to the work of state bodies.

03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:51.680
What else falls under confidential information?

03:50:51.680 --> 03:50:57.680
Under confidential information, there are so-called professional secrets.

03:50:57.680 --> 03:51:05.680
Professional secret.

03:51:05.680 --> 03:51:11.680
Professional secret is where there is a certain profession.

03:51:11.680 --> 03:51:17.680
At the legislative level, there are about 15 types of secrets related to certain professions.

03:51:17.680 --> 03:51:25.680
The most common are the notary secret, the lawyer's secret, the medical secret, and so on.

03:51:25.680 --> 03:51:31.680
This is also a section of confidential information.

03:51:31.680 --> 03:51:35.680
This is a confidential matter of the shipyard.

03:51:35.680 --> 03:52:03.680
This is confidential information about the essence of the invention,

03:52:03.680 --> 03:52:07.680
the use of the model or industrial sample.

03:52:07.680 --> 03:52:17.680
This is so-called confidential information.

03:52:17.680 --> 03:52:23.680
I will stop at the commercial secret.

03:52:23.680 --> 03:52:27.680
This is a direction of activity.

03:52:27.680 --> 03:52:35.680
Many organizations are forming a commercial secret regime.

03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:41.680
This activity arose after the adoption of the commercial secret law.

03:52:41.680 --> 03:52:45.680
There are already certain developments that can be shared.

03:52:45.680 --> 03:52:59.680
I will write it in abbreviated form.

03:52:59.680 --> 03:53:11.680
The commercial secret.

03:53:11.680 --> 03:53:19.680
The commercial secret appeared not yesterday and not 10 years ago.

03:53:19.680 --> 03:53:25.680
At the level of the Russian state, before the revolution, there was a concept of a production secret.

03:53:25.680 --> 03:53:29.680
In fact, this is a commercial secret.

03:53:29.680 --> 03:53:35.680
After the revolution of 1917, there was a concept of a commercial secret.

03:53:35.680 --> 03:53:41.680
Commercial activity was developed during the NEP.

03:53:41.680 --> 03:53:51.680
After the NEP, when commercial activity ceased to exist, the concept of a commercial secret was abolished.

03:53:51.680 --> 03:53:57.680
In 1990, when a new regulatory base was created,

03:53:57.680 --> 03:54:03.680
when the law on the basis of business activity in the USSR was adopted,

03:54:03.680 --> 03:54:09.680
the concept of a commercial secret was born.

03:54:09.680 --> 03:54:13.680
The Civil Code has an entire article on the commercial secret.

03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:21.680
This article regulates the existence of a commercial secret,

03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:27.680
the possibility of protecting the commercial secret in all legal ways,

03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:33.680
and the responsibility for the disclosure of the commercial secret.

03:54:33.680 --> 03:54:39.680
These are the three fundamental points that are in the Civil Code on the commercial secret.

03:54:39.680 --> 03:54:43.680
At the level of the law, this problem also arose in the 1990s.

03:54:43.680 --> 03:54:49.680
Somewhere in 1998, the commercial secret bill existed.

03:54:49.680 --> 03:54:57.680
It was not fully implemented.

03:54:57.680 --> 03:55:03.680
The commercial secret law was implemented only in 2004,

03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:09.680
when it was signed by the President.

03:55:09.680 --> 03:55:15.680
What does it say?

03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:21.680
What do I want to draw your attention to when we talk about the commercial secret law?

03:55:21.680 --> 03:55:29.680
There are some fundamental points that you should know if you are going to create a commercial secret regime.

03:55:29.680 --> 03:55:35.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

03:55:35.680 --> 03:55:43.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

03:55:43.680 --> 03:55:51.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

03:55:51.680 --> 03:55:59.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

03:55:59.680 --> 03:56:05.680
What is it about?

03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:13.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

03:56:13.680 --> 03:56:21.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

03:56:21.680 --> 03:56:29.680
If it is not recorded on material media, you cannot create a commercial secret regime.

03:56:29.680 --> 03:56:37.680
Material media can be either paper media or electronic media.

03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:45.680
Electronic media must be recorded on material media.

03:56:45.680 --> 03:56:53.680
It can be floppy disks, hard drives, hard drives, anything.

03:56:53.680 --> 03:57:01.680
The second point is the legal way to obtain a commercial secret.

03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:11.680
The second point is the legal way to obtain a commercial secret.

03:57:11.680 --> 03:57:17.680
It has always been believed that a commercial secret can be stolen,

03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:23.680
that it can be obtained in some illegal way.

03:57:23.680 --> 03:57:29.680
A commercial secret is a commodity that can be bought or sold.

03:57:29.680 --> 03:57:35.680
It can be obtained as a result of systematic investigations.

03:57:35.680 --> 03:57:43.680
The third point is what cannot be a commercial secret.

03:57:43.680 --> 03:57:49.680
It cannot be a commercial secret.

03:57:49.680 --> 03:57:59.680
Countries in the world have developed in two different ways.

03:57:59.680 --> 03:58:05.680
Some countries have decided what can be a commercial secret.

03:58:05.680 --> 03:58:11.680
The law states that information about this or that can be a commercial secret.

03:58:11.680 --> 03:58:17.680
Other countries, including Russia, have taken a different path.

03:58:17.680 --> 03:58:23.680
We have decided on the level of the law, before that there was a government resolution,

03:58:23.680 --> 03:58:29.680
and we have decided to keep our commercial secrets as an exception.

03:58:29.680 --> 03:58:35.680
It is considered a more democratic method.

03:58:35.680 --> 03:58:41.680
However, when this problem first arose in the early 1990s,

03:58:41.680 --> 03:58:47.680
it was not clear what a commercial secret should be.

03:58:47.680 --> 03:58:51.680
What cannot be a commercial secret?

03:58:51.680 --> 03:59:01.680
The first thing that cannot be a commercial secret is identification data.

03:59:01.680 --> 03:59:09.680
Identification data.

03:59:09.680 --> 03:59:15.680
All the information about identification data can be a set of documents,

03:59:15.680 --> 03:59:21.680
documents confirming the registration of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs

03:59:21.680 --> 03:59:27.680
in accordance with the Regulations of the State, documents giving the right to engage in entrepreneurial activity,

03:59:27.680 --> 03:59:33.680
that is, licenses, a list of individuals who have the right to act without confidence, and so on.

03:59:33.680 --> 03:59:37.680
The next point is what cannot be a commercial secret.

03:59:37.680 --> 03:59:43.680
As far as I understand, identification data never tries to be a commercial secret,

03:59:43.680 --> 03:59:49.680
on the contrary, all licenses and patents are put in a frame somewhere in plain sight.

03:59:49.680 --> 03:59:57.680
Everything that concerns workers and working conditions.

03:59:57.680 --> 04:00:11.680
Information about workers and working conditions in commercial and non-commercial organizations cannot be a commercial secret.

04:00:11.680 --> 04:00:15.680
What is it about? The number of workers, the availability of free jobs,

04:00:15.680 --> 04:00:20.680
the system of labor payment, labor conditions, labor security,

04:00:20.680 --> 04:00:26.680
the employment of employers on the basis of salary payment, social payments,

04:00:26.680 --> 04:00:28.680
the indicators of production trauma, and so on.

04:00:28.680 --> 04:00:31.680
All this information cannot be a commercial secret.

04:00:31.680 --> 04:00:36.680
Here, the question usually arises about the labor payment system.

04:00:36.680 --> 04:00:43.680
That is, it is possible or impossible to make absolute figures, that is, a salary is a commercial secret.

04:00:43.680 --> 04:00:46.680
There are different approaches.

04:00:46.680 --> 04:00:51.680
In principle, the labor payment system can be quite simple,

04:00:51.680 --> 04:00:55.680
advance payment, payment and bonus.

04:00:55.680 --> 04:00:57.680
This cannot be a commercial secret.

04:00:57.680 --> 04:01:03.680
In principle, I think that you can make your commercial secrets in absolute quantities.

04:01:03.680 --> 04:01:09.680
The issue is quite controversial, even at the level of judicial decisions.

04:01:10.680 --> 04:01:29.680
Information about non-commercial organizations cannot be a commercial secret.

04:01:29.680 --> 04:01:35.680
The size of income and expenditure structures, the size of the total property, the use of unpaid labor, and so on.

04:01:36.680 --> 04:01:42.680
The point is that a commercial secret is not clearly tied to a commercial organization.

04:01:42.680 --> 04:01:45.680
A commercial secret can be in a state enterprise.

04:01:45.680 --> 04:01:52.680
Here, at the level of the law, it is not limited to the fact that a commercial secret is necessarily a commercial enterprise.

04:01:52.680 --> 04:01:54.680
Just terminology.

04:01:54.680 --> 04:02:09.680
Information about state enterprises, state enterprises, state enterprises, unitary enterprises and state institutions,

04:02:09.680 --> 04:02:15.680
the composition of property, the use of funds of appropriate budgets, conditions of competitions, auctions, and so on.

04:02:15.680 --> 04:02:17.680
Here is an interesting point.

04:02:17.680 --> 04:02:21.680
Everything related to information is related to the implementation of security requirements.

04:02:22.680 --> 04:02:32.680
The implementation of security requirements.

04:02:32.680 --> 04:02:37.680
What is this about?

04:02:37.680 --> 04:02:39.680
This is about the security of citizens.

04:02:39.680 --> 04:02:44.680
According to the logic of the law, corporate security is not taken into account.

04:02:44.680 --> 04:02:47.680
Security of all citizens is taken into account.

04:02:48.680 --> 04:02:57.680
Corporate security, security of the organization, security of the legal entity, is usually a commercial secret.

04:02:57.680 --> 04:02:59.680
This is some kind of classified information.

04:02:59.680 --> 04:03:04.680
We are talking about the security of citizens.

04:03:04.680 --> 04:03:12.680
Pollution of the environment, state of fire safety, sanitary, epidemiological and radiation situation.

04:03:13.680 --> 04:03:18.680
Roughly speaking, if there is a factory and it dumps some not very useful substances into the river,

04:03:18.680 --> 04:03:22.680
then the information that it does this cannot be a commercial secret.

04:03:22.680 --> 04:03:32.680
If some products are produced, that there are some not very useful products or ingredients for a person,

04:03:32.680 --> 04:03:35.680
information about this cannot be a commercial secret.

04:03:35.680 --> 04:03:39.680
Everything related to corporate security is usually a commercial secret.

04:03:40.680 --> 04:04:01.680
Information about violations of the law cannot be a commercial secret.

04:04:01.680 --> 04:04:07.680
Information about the obligation to disclose them or the inability to restrict them is established by various federal laws.

04:04:07.680 --> 04:04:10.680
Everything else can be a commercial secret.

04:04:12.680 --> 04:04:22.680
Generally, there are some methods of determining a commercial secret.

04:04:22.680 --> 04:04:36.680
At the level of our law on commercial secrets, ideology is all that is allowed and all that is not prohibited.

04:04:36.680 --> 04:04:41.680
Therefore, the method exists, such a concept as a total method.

04:04:41.680 --> 04:04:47.680
Although in practice, as far as I know, it is practically not applied, but in general, it exists.

04:04:48.680 --> 04:04:50.680
How does the situation work?

04:04:50.680 --> 04:04:53.680
All the information resources of the company are taken,

04:04:53.680 --> 04:04:58.680
from there information resources that cannot be a commercial secret are taken out,

04:04:58.680 --> 04:05:02.680
everything related to open information is removed,

04:05:02.680 --> 04:05:06.680
because it makes no sense to close information that can be obtained in the open.

04:05:06.680 --> 04:05:12.680
The state secret is removed, some other information is removed, and everything else is done in a commercial secret.

04:05:13.680 --> 04:05:18.680
This is a total method, all the information that can be disclosed.

04:05:18.680 --> 04:05:29.680
As a rule, this is a very expensive event, and rarely any companies can afford to close their information resources.

04:05:29.680 --> 04:05:33.680
Therefore, other methods are usually used,

04:05:34.680 --> 04:05:38.680
or there is such a concept as the plagiarism method.

04:05:42.680 --> 04:05:44.680
What does the plagiarism mean?

04:05:44.680 --> 04:05:54.680
It assumes that there is such a concept as a plagiarism, that is, a methodology, I would say.

04:05:55.680 --> 04:06:01.680
A company is taken, which is approximately similar to yours in terms of volume,

04:06:01.680 --> 04:06:07.680
in terms of the number of people, in terms of the produced product or provided services.

04:06:07.680 --> 04:06:15.680
If there is a commercial secret mode, then it is looked at and determined what is done in that company.

04:06:15.680 --> 04:06:22.680
And do the same thing in your company, because the companies work on the same market.

04:06:22.680 --> 04:06:24.680
It is widely used.

04:06:24.680 --> 04:06:28.680
There is a method called the expert method.

04:06:33.680 --> 04:06:39.680
Expert, as a rule, is the attraction of experts, that is, the attraction of specialists from the outside.

04:06:41.680 --> 04:06:45.680
And there is a method called the analytical method.

04:06:45.680 --> 04:06:47.680
Analytical.

04:06:51.680 --> 04:07:01.680
That is, a certain analysis of the company's activities is carried out from the point of view of what is necessary to do in a commercial secret.

04:07:02.680 --> 04:07:05.680
Basically, the analytical method is based on what?

04:07:05.680 --> 04:07:11.680
It is based on what interests the competitor.

04:07:17.680 --> 04:07:23.680
That is, they try to put themselves in the shoes of competitors and try to understand what can interest the competitor.

04:07:23.680 --> 04:07:27.680
And the second direction of the analytical method is what will cause damage.

04:07:32.680 --> 04:07:36.680
That is, we try to understand what information can damage the disclosure.

04:07:36.680 --> 04:07:43.680
Based on this, they try to determine what information should be included in the commercial secret.

04:07:43.680 --> 04:07:49.680
From these methods, the first, second and fourth, this company can do it on its own.

04:07:49.680 --> 04:07:58.680
The third method, that is, the attraction of experts, is that you find an organization, pay them money, and based on these three methods, they try to determine everything.

04:07:59.680 --> 04:08:01.680
This is based on methods.

04:08:01.680 --> 04:08:04.680
Now the next point.

04:08:07.680 --> 04:08:11.680
The law, if we analyze it this way, is very organizational.

04:08:11.680 --> 04:08:24.680
That is, you will not find any innovations there, you will not find any rigidly regulating things applicable to your company.

04:08:24.680 --> 04:08:26.680
It is very organizational.

04:08:26.680 --> 04:08:28.680
That is, it is general and very organizational.

04:08:28.680 --> 04:08:31.680
That is, rights, duties, what can be done, what cannot be done.

04:08:31.680 --> 04:08:37.680
Naturally, each company creates its own commercial secret regime and creates it for itself.

04:08:37.680 --> 04:08:41.680
Here, by the way, is a very subtle point that I would like to draw your attention to.

04:08:41.680 --> 04:08:44.680
At least, many companies face this.

04:08:44.680 --> 04:08:56.680
If you have to pass your commercial secret to some other organization, within the framework of something, within the framework of consulting, within the framework of some kind of contractual cooperation,

04:08:56.680 --> 04:09:02.680
keep in mind that the commercial secret regime in another organization can be completely different.

04:09:02.680 --> 04:09:09.680
Unlike, say, the state secret regime, which is unified at all enterprises, where there are state secrets, and throughout Russia.

04:09:09.680 --> 04:09:17.680
The commercial secret regime is unique, it is individual, it is created directly in each company, and is approved by the management of the company.

04:09:17.680 --> 04:09:21.680
In your company, the commercial secret regime can be very strong and very serious.

04:09:21.680 --> 04:09:29.680
You will pass it on to some other company, there may be a completely different regime, and everything may be completely different, much worse.

04:09:29.680 --> 04:09:32.680
Therefore, keep this in mind.

04:09:32.680 --> 04:09:36.680
And, in principle, I would not recommend passing commercial secrets anywhere.

04:09:36.680 --> 04:09:43.680
That is, you can talk about the serious preservation of commercial secrets only when these commercial secrets are with you.

04:09:43.680 --> 04:09:54.680
As soon as you pass your commercial secrets somewhere, you can very conditionally say that these commercial secrets will be protected or preserved.

04:09:54.680 --> 04:10:10.680
Another point I would like to emphasize is the relationship between enterprises and various state bodies within the framework of the commercial secret regime.

04:10:10.680 --> 04:10:18.680
It is clear that there are controlling law enforcement agencies that can come to the company and carry out some actions.

04:10:18.680 --> 04:10:25.680
This can be within the framework of inspection activities, it can be within the framework of investigative activities, it can be within the framework of operational activities.

04:10:25.680 --> 04:10:31.680
It is pointless and impossible to protect yourself from this with the help of commercial secrets,

04:10:31.680 --> 04:10:42.680
simply because, according to our legislation, you must provide information on the motivated requirements of these state bodies, including the component of the commercial secret.

04:10:42.680 --> 04:10:49.680
This will not limit or limit various inspections.

04:10:49.680 --> 04:10:59.680
Another thing is that if you provide your commercial secrets to state bodies, they take on the obligation to preserve your commercial secrets.

04:10:59.680 --> 04:11:12.680
The next point I would like to draw your attention to is the so-called commercial secret regime.

04:11:13.680 --> 04:11:17.680
The regime of the CT.

04:11:17.680 --> 04:11:22.680
It is impossible to say that we have a commercial secret or not.

04:11:22.680 --> 04:11:34.680
You can say that there is a commercial secret regime only when you conduct a number of events that will allow you to say that you have a commercial secret regime.

04:11:34.680 --> 04:11:38.680
And, of course, all the consequences resulting from this.

04:11:39.680 --> 04:11:48.680
I have already said, I emphasize again, that the commercial secret regime is an individual event.

04:11:48.680 --> 04:11:54.680
The commercial secret regime is individual for each company and it can be different in different companies.

04:11:54.680 --> 04:11:58.680
The commercial secret regime is determined by the company's manager.

04:11:58.680 --> 04:12:04.680
That is, he approves certain documents that say what the commercial secret regime is and how it will be implemented.

04:12:05.680 --> 04:12:12.680
There is no maximum list of events on the commercial secret regime.

04:12:12.680 --> 04:12:19.680
There is a minimum number of events that you have to do to say that you have a commercial secret regime.

04:12:19.680 --> 04:12:24.680
This minimum is listed in the law of the commercial secret regime.

04:12:24.680 --> 04:12:26.680
I will now talk about them in more detail.

04:12:26.680 --> 04:12:28.680
There is no maximum, of course.

04:12:28.680 --> 04:12:34.680
According to the Civil Code and the law of the commercial secret regime,

04:12:34.680 --> 04:12:41.680
a company can implement any legal methods and methods of protecting its commercial secrets.

04:12:41.680 --> 04:12:44.680
I emphasize, legal methods, but any.

04:12:44.680 --> 04:12:49.680
What is the minimum on the commercial secret regime?

04:12:49.680 --> 04:12:51.680
What is the minimum that must be done?

04:12:51.680 --> 04:12:56.680
The first is to determine the information component of the commercial secret.

04:12:56.680 --> 04:13:06.680
The first is to determine the information component of the commercial secret.

04:13:06.680 --> 04:13:11.680
That is, you must determine what your commercial secret is.

04:13:11.680 --> 04:13:15.680
There are certain subtleties and difficulties.

04:13:15.680 --> 04:13:19.680
How does it usually happen?

04:13:19.680 --> 04:13:27.680
Usually, the security service is tasked with creating a list of information components of the commercial secret.

04:13:27.680 --> 04:13:34.680
The security service usually sends out letters to the structural units asking for suggestions

04:13:34.680 --> 04:13:39.680
on including some information components in the section of the commercial secret.

04:13:39.680 --> 04:13:45.680
The unit is based on the fact that the more information is hidden, the better.

04:13:45.680 --> 04:13:54.680
The security service composes and analyzes all this,

04:13:54.680 --> 04:13:57.680
and throws out at least half of it,

04:13:57.680 --> 04:14:03.680
because it makes no sense to hide information resources that can be openly available.

04:14:03.680 --> 04:14:11.680
Therefore, they usually try to protect the most serious and potentially significant information.

04:14:11.680 --> 04:14:15.680
If this succeeds, then they will expand this list of information.

04:14:15.680 --> 04:14:21.680
Therefore, as a recommendation, if you are going to do the commercial secret regime,

04:14:21.680 --> 04:14:26.680
try to close the smallest part of your information resources.

04:14:26.680 --> 04:14:30.680
This may not be very expensive and easy to organize.

04:14:30.680 --> 04:14:34.680
If you succeed, then try to expand this list.

04:14:34.680 --> 04:14:38.680
No one forbids you to periodically revise it, expand it, narrow it down.

04:14:38.680 --> 04:14:40.680
It's up to you.

04:14:40.680 --> 04:14:43.680
What will you face here?

04:14:43.680 --> 04:14:48.680
The list of information components of the commercial secret is usually information about.

04:14:48.680 --> 04:14:57.680
This is some information about what information is subject to closure.

04:14:57.680 --> 04:15:00.680
Usually, this is 1, 2, maximum 3 pages.

04:15:00.680 --> 04:15:05.680
The difficulty is to determine what is under these information.

04:15:05.680 --> 04:15:09.680
You can close the company's plan documents.

04:15:09.680 --> 04:15:13.680
The plan document of the company is the commercial secret.

04:15:13.680 --> 04:15:15.680
This is information that is subject to closure.

04:15:15.680 --> 04:15:18.680
Then there should be a person, a person in office,

04:15:18.680 --> 04:15:23.680
who would determine what documents are distributed to these plan documents of the company.

04:15:23.680 --> 04:15:29.680
In the list, it can be one item, but in reality, it can be hundreds, thousands of documents.

04:15:29.680 --> 04:15:33.680
Every day there will be a couple of dozen more documents.

04:15:33.680 --> 04:15:41.680
It is much more difficult to determine which documents are related to the company's plan documents.

04:15:41.680 --> 04:15:43.680
It is much more difficult.

04:15:43.680 --> 04:15:50.680
Determining the information component of the commercial secret and, of course, its approval of this list.

04:15:50.680 --> 04:15:56.680
It is usually approved either by order, the classic form, that is, the order of the company's manager.

04:15:56.680 --> 04:16:01.680
Such information about this, about that, is related to the commercial secret.

04:16:01.680 --> 04:16:04.680
This is a classic option.

04:16:04.680 --> 04:16:08.680
Sometimes this option is used, it is just an approval signature.

04:16:08.680 --> 04:16:14.680
That is, I approve, there is a general director, where the list of information components of the commercial secret will also be listed.

04:16:14.680 --> 04:16:21.680
This is the first thing to do to determine the commercial secret regime.

04:16:21.680 --> 04:16:24.680
The second thing that is usually done.

04:16:24.680 --> 04:16:33.680
In the law, this is a huge set of measures.

04:16:33.680 --> 04:16:36.680
This is a restriction of access to information.

04:16:36.680 --> 04:16:43.680
Restriction of access to information.

04:16:43.680 --> 04:16:56.680
This is a whole set of measures, including personnel, organizational, regime, technical, and other things,

04:16:56.680 --> 04:16:59.680
concerning the restriction of access to information.

04:16:59.680 --> 04:17:05.680
That is, you have determined that some information is a commercial secret, and then you must restrict access to this information.

04:17:05.680 --> 04:17:13.680
If this is a small number of documents or a small number of information resources, this can be done.

04:17:13.680 --> 04:17:18.680
As soon as these information resources take up half of the company's information resources,

04:17:18.680 --> 04:17:23.680
this is very difficult, very expensive, and usually it is simply not feasible.

04:17:23.680 --> 04:17:29.680
Therefore, in any case, if you have a leak of information,

04:17:29.680 --> 04:17:36.680
you will have to prove that you have restricted access to this information.

04:17:36.680 --> 04:17:43.680
Here is a criminal, he committed a crime and violated your access restriction system.

04:17:43.680 --> 04:17:49.680
That is, if you determine that the company's plan documents are a commercial secret,

04:17:49.680 --> 04:17:53.680
and these papers are printed out, lying around,

04:17:53.680 --> 04:17:59.680
then you don't have to talk about the commercial secret regime, because no one will do any hacking.

04:17:59.680 --> 04:18:02.680
That is, the information will be lost in any case.

04:18:02.680 --> 04:18:05.680
This is the second restriction of access to information.

04:18:05.680 --> 04:18:21.680
The third restriction of access to information is the solution of personnel problems.

04:18:22.680 --> 04:18:26.680
What is it usually?

04:18:26.680 --> 04:18:32.680
This is the definition of the people you will trust the information.

04:18:32.680 --> 04:18:39.680
The definition of the circle of persons.

04:18:39.680 --> 04:18:48.680
That is, the definition of those people you will trust your commercial secrets.

04:18:48.680 --> 04:18:51.680
There can be not many of them,

04:18:51.680 --> 04:18:55.680
you usually define certain people, personally,

04:18:55.680 --> 04:18:58.680
for example, Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov, have access to commercial secrets.

04:18:58.680 --> 04:19:09.680
Moreover, it is not necessary to allow a person to access all your commercial information.

04:19:09.680 --> 04:19:16.680
We are talking about permission to commercial secrets only within the framework of fulfilling your duties.

04:19:16.680 --> 04:19:19.680
If this is a financial person, then everything that concerns finances.

04:19:19.680 --> 04:19:22.680
If this is a technologist, then everything that concerns technology.

04:19:22.680 --> 04:19:25.680
But you have to define the circle of persons.

04:19:25.680 --> 04:19:28.680
And this circle of persons must be officially approved.

04:19:28.680 --> 04:19:36.680
Basically, it is determined through an order that Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov are allowed to access official or commercial information.

04:19:36.680 --> 04:19:42.680
These employees must take obligations.

04:19:42.680 --> 04:19:44.680
Take obligations.

04:19:44.680 --> 04:19:55.680
Take obligations to keep commercial secrets.

04:19:55.680 --> 04:19:57.680
That is, you have defined a person,

04:19:57.680 --> 04:20:02.680
after that, a person must take obligations to keep commercial secrets.

04:20:02.680 --> 04:20:07.680
But usually, what are the options for taking obligations?

04:20:07.680 --> 04:20:14.680
They can be taken, for example, within the framework of labor relations, within the framework of a labor agreement,

04:20:14.680 --> 04:20:19.680
where one of the parameters is laid down that the preservation of the secrets is protected by the law,

04:20:19.680 --> 04:20:22.680
which has become known within the framework of fulfilling the duties of the employee.

04:20:22.680 --> 04:20:27.680
This can be a separate agreement or a separate agreement on the preservation of commercial secrets.

04:20:27.680 --> 04:20:33.680
By analogy, there is a contract on the preservation of the bank secret.

04:20:33.680 --> 04:20:37.680
In legal systems, this blank exists.

04:20:37.680 --> 04:20:39.680
It is taken approximately by analogy.

04:20:39.680 --> 04:20:41.680
That is, a person takes obligations.

04:20:41.680 --> 04:20:46.680
Moreover, I would recommend to conclude a separate agreement, a separate agreement,

04:20:46.680 --> 04:20:50.680
simply because in a separate agreement, a separate agreement,

04:20:50.680 --> 04:20:54.680
you can describe in great detail, let's say, many points.

04:20:55.680 --> 04:20:59.680
In particular, what is understood under the disclosure of a commercial secret.

04:20:59.680 --> 04:21:01.680
That is, this is a rather specific thing.

04:21:01.680 --> 04:21:04.680
And what is the disclosure of a commercial secret?

04:21:04.680 --> 04:21:13.680
There, again, from the point of view of psychological impact on a potential offender,

04:21:13.680 --> 04:21:20.680
that is, there is a certain psychological impact when a person concludes a separate agreement.

04:21:20.680 --> 04:21:24.680
And then criminal, administrative, labor and so on.

04:21:24.680 --> 04:21:27.680
This is more effective from the point of view of psychology.

04:21:27.680 --> 04:21:31.680
In a separate agreement, in a separate agreement,

04:21:31.680 --> 04:21:36.680
it can be prescribed that a person after dismissal keeps your commercial secrets.

04:21:36.680 --> 04:21:43.680
Moreover, if we read according to the law, then even by default there is a certain period,

04:21:43.680 --> 04:21:45.680
it is three years.

04:21:45.680 --> 04:21:49.680
That is, if a person has taken on himself the obligation to preserve a commercial secret,

04:21:49.680 --> 04:21:51.680
but did not prescribe it for what period,

04:21:51.680 --> 04:21:54.680
then by default it is considered that within three years after dismissal,

04:21:54.680 --> 04:21:57.680
the employee is obliged to keep your commercial secrets.

04:21:57.680 --> 04:22:01.680
In practice, let's say, it is quite difficult to control,

04:22:01.680 --> 04:22:04.680
and even more difficult to bring a person to responsibility.

04:22:04.680 --> 04:22:13.680
Therefore, if you want a person to keep your commercial secrets after dismissal,

04:22:13.680 --> 04:22:16.680
it is better to conclude a separate agreement,

04:22:16.680 --> 04:22:24.680
because the labor agreement is terminated with the termination of labor relations.

04:22:24.680 --> 04:22:30.680
And there, as a rule, it is difficult to apply the norms

04:22:30.680 --> 04:22:35.680
regarding what happens after termination of labor relations.

04:22:35.680 --> 04:22:37.680
Therefore, it is better to conclude a separate agreement.

04:22:37.680 --> 04:22:41.680
In any case, such obligations in one form or another must be taken.

04:22:42.680 --> 04:22:52.680
So, the framework of the issue, the solution is that employees must know what the commercial secret is.

04:22:52.680 --> 04:23:01.680
That is, a person takes on the obligation to preserve a commercial secret,

04:23:01.680 --> 04:23:07.680
he must be informed that the information that we trust you with is a commercial secret.

04:23:08.680 --> 04:23:10.680
And he must sign it.

04:23:10.680 --> 04:23:13.680
That is, any action must be signed.

04:23:13.680 --> 04:23:15.680
He takes on the obligation, he must sign it.

04:23:15.680 --> 04:23:18.680
He is pleased with what is a commercial secret, he must sign it.

04:23:20.680 --> 04:23:25.680
And in relation to personnel issues, I will probably also draw your attention to the fact that

04:23:25.680 --> 04:23:41.680
it is very important to create conditions for employees to perform the commercial secret regime.

04:23:41.680 --> 04:23:44.680
What is it?

04:23:44.680 --> 04:23:50.680
As a rule, if a commercial secret regime is created, a certain normative base is formed,

04:23:50.680 --> 04:23:54.680
instructions are created, where it is clearly regulated what can be done, what cannot be done.

04:23:54.680 --> 04:23:58.680
This is applicable to specific people, to specific official duties.

04:23:58.680 --> 04:24:00.680
This is the first thing.

04:24:00.680 --> 04:24:09.680
And the second thing is that if you prescribe that an employee must store a commercial document,

04:24:09.680 --> 04:24:14.680
a document that constitutes a commercial secret, in a safe, then you must at least put this safe in it.

04:24:14.680 --> 04:24:16.680
These are obvious things.

04:24:16.680 --> 04:24:21.680
Nevertheless, this is also a certain commercial secret regime that must be.

04:24:22.680 --> 04:24:34.680
The next thing, everything that concerns the commercial secret regime, is the regulation of relations with counteragents.

04:24:34.680 --> 04:24:42.680
Let's call it the regulation of contractual relations.

04:24:42.680 --> 04:24:52.680
What is it about?

04:24:52.680 --> 04:24:54.680
The regulation of contractual relations.

04:24:54.680 --> 04:25:02.680
If you transfer your commercial secrets to other organizations within the framework of some work,

04:25:02.680 --> 04:25:07.680
then in the contract on the basis of which you provide this information,

04:25:07.680 --> 04:25:14.680
you must prescribe that another organization, where you transfer all this, must keep your commercial secrets,

04:25:14.680 --> 04:25:22.680
apply all the measures of protection, you can prescribe that you can control the measures that another organization will apply.

04:25:22.680 --> 04:25:26.680
Always assume that the commercial secret regime is individual,

04:25:26.680 --> 04:25:32.680
and another organization may have a much worse regime, simply because they see it that way.

04:25:32.680 --> 04:25:36.680
This must also be done in a mandatory manner.

04:25:36.680 --> 04:25:43.680
And perhaps the last thing that concerns the commercial secret regime,

04:25:43.680 --> 04:25:48.680
the minimum that you must do, is the application of a distinctive neck to a material carrier.

04:25:48.680 --> 04:26:04.680
The application of a distinctive neck to a material carrier.

04:26:04.680 --> 04:26:08.680
Let's call it KT.

04:26:08.680 --> 04:26:09.680
Of course, I am decoding it.

04:26:09.680 --> 04:26:11.680
The commercial secret.

04:26:11.680 --> 04:26:16.680
As I said at the beginning, the commercial secret must be fixed on the material carriers.

04:26:16.680 --> 04:26:21.680
These material carriers, it can be a paper carrier, it can be an electronic carrier,

04:26:21.680 --> 04:26:25.680
they must have a certain restrictive neck.

04:26:25.680 --> 04:26:30.680
A regular restrictive neck is a commercial secret with an indication of whether it has this information,

04:26:30.680 --> 04:26:34.680
for legal entities, a full name and location,

04:26:34.680 --> 04:26:40.680
for individual entrepreneurs, the surname, name, address, citizen, who are an individual entrepreneur, a place of residence.

04:26:41.680 --> 04:26:46.680
This does not always suit companies,

04:26:46.680 --> 04:26:54.680
because as soon as a commercial secret appears on some paper,

04:26:54.680 --> 04:27:00.680
the employees immediately start thinking about how to sell this document to make money on it.

04:27:00.680 --> 04:27:06.680
Therefore, sometimes this is not applicable to some organizations, to some companies,

04:27:06.680 --> 04:27:10.680
but in principle, it is legally obligatory.

04:27:10.680 --> 04:27:19.680
Here is a list of events, a minimum of events that must be done to create a commercial secret.

04:27:19.680 --> 04:27:22.680
Here is another rather subtle point regarding the neck.

04:27:22.680 --> 04:27:29.680
At the legislative level, it is not determined whether this neck can be divided into some sub-necks.

04:27:29.680 --> 04:27:36.680
Confidential, strictly confidential, commercial secret, strictly commercial secret, special commercial secret.

04:27:36.680 --> 04:27:41.680
At the legislative level, this is not the case, so I would not recommend doing this,

04:27:41.680 --> 04:27:44.680
simply because it is not in the law.

04:27:44.680 --> 04:27:48.680
If there are any problems and a judicial decision is required,

04:27:48.680 --> 04:27:51.680
then there may be different approaches to these problems.

04:27:52.680 --> 04:27:56.680
Now, the next point.

04:27:56.680 --> 04:27:59.680
The commercial secret has certain characteristics.

04:27:59.680 --> 04:28:03.680
The characteristics of a commercial secret are its commercial value,

04:28:03.680 --> 04:28:08.680
that is, you cannot hide information that is not a commercial value for you.

04:28:08.680 --> 04:28:12.680
Although the approach is quite individual, for different companies,

04:28:12.680 --> 04:28:15.680
the commercial value may have different information,

04:28:15.680 --> 04:28:18.680
that is, different information may have different commercial value.

04:28:18.680 --> 04:28:21.680
This is inaccessibility, this is mandatory,

04:28:21.680 --> 04:28:27.680
that is, you must restrict access to information in a mandatory manner.

04:28:27.680 --> 04:28:33.680
This is security, that is, a certain commercial secret regime must be created.

04:28:33.680 --> 04:28:35.680
This is an unlimited security period.

04:28:35.680 --> 04:28:37.680
Here is a rather subtle point,

04:28:37.680 --> 04:28:40.680
due to the fact that at the legislative level,

04:28:40.680 --> 04:28:46.680
the period during which you create a commercial secret regime is not specified.

04:28:46.680 --> 04:28:50.680
It can be a year, it can be half a year, it can be one day.

04:28:50.680 --> 04:28:53.680
That is, you can create a commercial secret regime for one day.

04:28:53.680 --> 04:28:57.680
You can create a commercial secret regime for 100 years,

04:28:57.680 --> 04:28:59.680
that is, depending on the need,

04:28:59.680 --> 04:29:05.680
unlike, say, some other restrictive rights,

04:29:05.680 --> 04:29:09.680
in the form of copyright, there is a clear, definite period.

04:29:09.680 --> 04:29:12.680
The commercial secret period is not defined,

04:29:12.680 --> 04:29:15.680
it is up to the company's managers.

04:29:21.680 --> 04:29:23.680
Now the question arises,

04:29:23.680 --> 04:29:26.680
what does it usually mean to have a commercial secret?

04:29:26.680 --> 04:29:30.680
I have already mentioned some methods that exist.

04:29:30.680 --> 04:29:33.680
There are certain approaches.

04:29:33.680 --> 04:29:40.680
What should we attribute to a commercial secret?

04:29:43.680 --> 04:29:45.680
As far as I understand,

04:29:45.680 --> 04:29:51.680
this problem is usually a technology.

04:29:55.680 --> 04:29:59.680
If the company has some technologies,

04:29:59.680 --> 04:30:01.680
so-called know-how,

04:30:01.680 --> 04:30:05.680
that is, some technological innovations,

04:30:05.680 --> 04:30:07.680
that is, technological moments,

04:30:07.680 --> 04:30:10.680
then, as a rule, if a commercial secret regime is created,

04:30:10.680 --> 04:30:12.680
it is necessarily included there.

04:30:14.680 --> 04:30:16.680
This can be,

04:30:20.680 --> 04:30:24.680
let's say, some kind of management information.

04:30:26.680 --> 04:30:28.680
Management information.

04:30:31.680 --> 04:30:33.680
Management information.

04:30:33.680 --> 04:30:36.680
That is, everything that concerns management issues.

04:30:37.680 --> 04:30:39.680
I have already mentioned this.

04:30:39.680 --> 04:30:42.680
This is all about the company's plans.

04:30:42.680 --> 04:30:45.680
First of all, this refers to some kind of strategic plan,

04:30:45.680 --> 04:30:50.680
that is, strategic development plans, and everything else.

04:30:52.680 --> 04:30:55.680
This is all about financial issues.

04:30:57.680 --> 04:30:59.680
Financial.

04:30:59.680 --> 04:31:04.680
There are things that you have to introduce

04:31:04.680 --> 04:31:06.680
into the commercial secret regime.

04:31:06.680 --> 04:31:09.680
In particular, in the accounting law,

04:31:09.680 --> 04:31:11.680
if I'm not mistaken,

04:31:11.680 --> 04:31:16.680
accounting records should be related to confidential information.

04:31:18.680 --> 04:31:20.680
The rest of the things should be considered

04:31:20.680 --> 04:31:25.680
depending on the financial documents.

04:31:25.680 --> 04:31:27.680
This is analytics.

04:31:28.680 --> 04:31:34.680
Especially if you have an analytical unit in your company

04:31:34.680 --> 04:31:36.680
that analyzes the situation,

04:31:36.680 --> 04:31:41.680
that is, it can conduct some analytical work,

04:31:41.680 --> 04:31:44.680
make some analytical reports, documents.

04:31:44.680 --> 04:31:46.680
The results of these analytical studies,

04:31:46.680 --> 04:31:50.680
as a rule, belong to the commercial secret regime.

04:31:51.680 --> 04:31:56.680
Despite the fact that they can be obtained from open sources,

04:31:56.680 --> 04:31:59.680
that is, from the same mass media,

04:31:59.680 --> 04:32:04.680
they can already have limited access to do some analytical work.

04:32:05.680 --> 04:32:09.680
This is all about the information of negotiations.

04:32:12.680 --> 04:32:14.680
This includes who,

04:32:14.680 --> 04:32:17.680
or rather, what companies are negotiated with,

04:32:17.680 --> 04:32:20.680
what topic, what conditions, everything that concerns.

04:32:20.680 --> 04:32:23.680
Everything that concerns some kind of contracts,

04:32:23.680 --> 04:32:25.680
contracts in business relations.

04:32:25.680 --> 04:32:27.680
Pricing policy,

04:32:27.680 --> 04:32:29.680
it can be the terms of the contract,

04:32:29.680 --> 04:32:31.680
benefits, and everything else.

04:32:33.680 --> 04:32:35.680
There may be some other things.

04:32:35.680 --> 04:32:37.680
That is, naturally, each company,

04:32:37.680 --> 04:32:41.680
depending on what it does,

04:32:41.680 --> 04:32:44.680
it compiles its information

04:32:44.680 --> 04:32:46.680
related to the commercial secret.

04:32:47.680 --> 04:32:49.680
So...

04:32:52.680 --> 04:32:54.680
Well, here, probably,

04:32:54.680 --> 04:32:57.680
this is what I would like to emphasize again.

04:32:57.680 --> 04:33:00.680
Will you create the commercial secret regime?

04:33:00.680 --> 04:33:01.680
You will not.

04:33:01.680 --> 04:33:03.680
These are your questions.

04:33:03.680 --> 04:33:05.680
If you create the commercial secret regime,

04:33:05.680 --> 04:33:09.680
then try to close a very small amount of information first.

04:33:09.680 --> 04:33:11.680
If you succeed, then gradually expand.

04:33:11.680 --> 04:33:15.680
Because closing information is a rather expensive method.

04:33:15.680 --> 04:33:17.680
And, as a rule,

04:33:17.680 --> 04:33:21.680
not all companies can seriously approach this.

04:33:21.680 --> 04:33:24.680
And they cannot seriously allocate serious funds

04:33:24.680 --> 04:33:26.680
to protect, to close information.

04:33:26.680 --> 04:33:29.680
If it is half a percent of information resources,

04:33:29.680 --> 04:33:31.680
you can still close.

04:33:31.680 --> 04:33:34.680
If you are trying to close 30% of information resources,

04:33:34.680 --> 04:33:36.680
yes, it is possible, but it is very expensive.

04:33:38.680 --> 04:33:41.680
So, this is about the commercial secret.

04:33:41.680 --> 04:33:43.680
Well, in relation to the responsibility

04:33:43.680 --> 04:33:45.680
for disclosure of the commercial secret,

04:33:45.680 --> 04:33:47.680
I will not talk about it now,

04:33:47.680 --> 04:33:49.680
because I have already talked about it

04:33:49.680 --> 04:33:52.680
in the section called personnel security.

04:33:52.680 --> 04:33:54.680
So, here, probably,

04:33:54.680 --> 04:33:57.680
this is what I would like to focus on.

04:33:57.680 --> 04:34:02.680
So, this is about, let's say,

04:34:04.680 --> 04:34:09.680
in general, protection of information with limited access.

04:34:09.680 --> 04:34:12.680
So, all protection of information with limited access,

04:34:12.680 --> 04:34:16.680
in general, I have already said that it is complex.

04:34:16.680 --> 04:34:19.680
That is, you cannot protect information resources

04:34:19.680 --> 04:34:22.680
just with some piece.

04:34:22.680 --> 04:34:26.680
The forms in which the information is located

04:34:26.680 --> 04:34:28.680
are determined by means of these forms,

04:34:28.680 --> 04:34:32.680
the methods of protection of information are determined.

04:34:32.680 --> 04:34:36.680
So, as a rule, everything that concerns a complex solution,

04:34:36.680 --> 04:34:38.680
protection,

04:34:40.680 --> 04:34:45.680
is organizational measures,

04:34:48.680 --> 04:34:50.680
is legal measures,

04:34:54.680 --> 04:34:56.680
is technical measures.

04:35:00.680 --> 04:35:04.680
Technically, IT security measures are included here,

04:35:04.680 --> 04:35:08.680
and protection from channels of information leakage is included.

04:35:08.680 --> 04:35:12.680
This is a confidential matter of production,

04:35:16.680 --> 04:35:18.680
an official matter of production.

04:35:20.680 --> 04:35:25.680
And this is, let's call it, a regime event.

04:35:29.680 --> 04:35:31.680
A regime event.

04:35:32.680 --> 04:35:36.680
Now, in a nutshell,

04:35:36.680 --> 04:35:41.680
I would like to talk about a confidential matter of production,

04:35:41.680 --> 04:35:43.680
because I mentioned it,

04:35:43.680 --> 04:35:47.680
and now I will just remind you about a confidential matter of production.

04:35:47.680 --> 04:35:52.680
So, the question related to a confidential matter of production.

04:35:52.680 --> 04:35:55.680
This is also a component of IT security.

04:35:55.680 --> 04:35:57.680
As I said,

04:35:57.680 --> 04:36:00.680
this is one of the directions,

04:36:00.680 --> 04:36:05.680
some events are related to IT security.

04:36:05.680 --> 04:36:10.680
So, when does a confidential matter of production occur?

04:36:13.680 --> 04:36:16.680
A confidential matter of production.

04:36:19.680 --> 04:36:22.680
Naturally, it occurs, first of all,

04:36:22.680 --> 04:36:25.680
when some information is protected,

04:36:25.680 --> 04:36:27.680
this is clear.

04:36:27.680 --> 04:36:31.680
And the second, when confidential information is presented in the form of certain documents,

04:36:31.680 --> 04:36:35.680
they can be material, paper, electronic.

04:36:35.680 --> 04:36:40.680
The point is that these documents are created somewhere,

04:36:40.680 --> 04:36:43.680
they are moved somewhere, stored somewhere,

04:36:43.680 --> 04:36:45.680
some resolutions are applied to them,

04:36:45.680 --> 04:36:47.680
something is done on them,

04:36:47.680 --> 04:36:49.680
that is, when there are certain documents of circulation.

04:36:49.680 --> 04:36:51.680
If these two conditions coincide,

04:36:51.680 --> 04:36:55.680
then it is necessary to create a confidential matter of production.

04:36:55.680 --> 04:36:58.680
It consists of two parts,

04:36:58.680 --> 04:37:00.680
in such a classic version.

04:37:00.680 --> 04:37:05.680
This is all that concerns the material matter of production.

04:37:05.680 --> 04:37:07.680
Material.

04:37:07.680 --> 04:37:10.680
Confidential matter of production.

04:37:10.680 --> 04:37:12.680
Everything that concerns the electronic.

04:37:12.680 --> 04:37:14.680
Electronic.

04:37:14.680 --> 04:37:16.680
Confidential matter of production.

04:37:17.680 --> 04:37:19.680
Electronic.

04:37:19.680 --> 04:37:21.680
Confidential matter of production.

04:37:21.680 --> 04:37:25.680
It occurs only when there is such a concept as an electronic document.

04:37:25.680 --> 04:37:28.680
The concept of an electronic document can only be understood

04:37:28.680 --> 04:37:33.680
when the authorship and authenticity of this electronic document is carried out,

04:37:33.680 --> 04:37:36.680
that is, when the electronic digital signature is applied.

04:37:36.680 --> 04:37:40.680
If you do not apply an electronic digital signature in the company,

04:37:40.680 --> 04:37:45.680
then, in general, it is pointless to create an electronic confidential matter of production.

04:37:45.680 --> 04:37:48.680
It will no longer be an electronic matter of production,

04:37:48.680 --> 04:37:52.680
but an electronic copy of the material matter of production.

04:37:52.680 --> 04:37:54.680
As soon as the ECP arises,

04:37:54.680 --> 04:37:58.680
you can create an electronic confidential matter of production.

04:37:58.680 --> 04:38:02.680
Please note that there is a law on electronic digital signatures,

04:38:02.680 --> 04:38:05.680
where certain rules of the game with the ECP are defined.

04:38:05.680 --> 04:38:12.680
A law on information, information technologies and information protection has also been adopted recently,

04:38:13.680 --> 04:38:19.680
where the electronic digital signature is recognized as an analogue of the confidential signature.

04:38:19.680 --> 04:38:23.680
Both the document signed by the electronic digital signature

04:38:23.680 --> 04:38:29.680
and the document signed by the confidential signature have the same legal power.

04:38:29.680 --> 04:38:32.680
But regarding the electronic digital signature,

04:38:32.680 --> 04:38:36.680
we also note that this is not a protection of information.

04:38:36.680 --> 04:38:42.680
The goal of the electronic digital signature is to confirm the authorship and authenticity of the document.

04:38:42.680 --> 04:38:45.680
That is, protection should be built separately.

04:38:45.680 --> 04:38:48.680
This is not a means of protection, but a means of authorship and authenticity.

04:38:48.680 --> 04:38:52.680
Everything that concerns the material matter of production,

04:38:52.680 --> 04:38:55.680
it consists of two directions.

04:38:55.680 --> 04:38:58.680
This is everything that concerns the document of circulation.

04:38:58.680 --> 04:39:12.680
And this is everything that concerns the archive, the information storage.

04:39:12.680 --> 04:39:16.680
In the simplified version of the archive, it is like an archive.

04:39:16.680 --> 04:39:21.680
In the more complex version of the archive, there is only the concept of an active archive.

04:39:21.680 --> 04:39:23.680
That is, the documents are submitted there,

04:39:23.680 --> 04:39:26.680
and from there they can be obtained.

04:39:26.680 --> 04:39:31.680
And it is necessary to check whether there is permission for these documents,

04:39:31.680 --> 04:39:34.680
which are submitted to the archive, whether the documents are returned,

04:39:34.680 --> 04:39:37.680
whether copies are made of them, whether they are changed.

04:39:37.680 --> 04:39:39.680
That is, the so-called life of the archive.

04:39:39.680 --> 04:39:42.680
Confidential case of production.

04:39:45.680 --> 04:39:48.680
Before creating a confidential case of production,

04:39:48.680 --> 04:39:54.680
the game rules are usually determined by some round stones.

04:39:54.680 --> 04:39:57.680
In particular, what to determine.

04:40:00.680 --> 04:40:06.680
That is, what questions should be answered before creating a confidential case of production.

04:40:10.680 --> 04:40:17.680
The first thing to do, let's say, when creating a confidential case of production,

04:40:17.680 --> 04:40:26.680
is to determine who appropriates and removes the neck.

04:40:31.680 --> 04:40:34.680
This is a rather unimportant question,

04:40:34.680 --> 04:40:41.680
because you have determined that, for example, the planned documents of the company are a commercial secret.

04:40:42.680 --> 04:40:45.680
Then there should be some official who would determine

04:40:45.680 --> 04:40:48.680
what documents the company's planned documents contain,

04:40:48.680 --> 04:40:51.680
which documents to include in the confidential case of production.

04:40:51.680 --> 04:40:54.680
This is a rather difficult option.

04:40:54.680 --> 04:40:56.680
You can go along the way that,

04:40:56.680 --> 04:41:00.680
usually in small organizations, some official determines this.

04:41:00.680 --> 04:41:04.680
You can go along the way that the document's executor determines

04:41:04.680 --> 04:41:09.680
whether the confidential information of this document is confidential,

04:41:09.680 --> 04:41:12.680
whether to include it or not in the confidential case of production.

04:41:14.680 --> 04:41:27.680
So, let's say, what documents should be included in the confidential case of production.

04:41:29.680 --> 04:41:31.680
This is also an important question,

04:41:31.680 --> 04:41:34.680
because in the classic case,

04:41:34.680 --> 04:41:39.680
the documents containing or making up the commercial secret are included in the confidential case of production.

04:41:41.680 --> 04:41:48.680
But in practice, there are a lot of documents that need to be included in this confidential case of production.

04:41:48.680 --> 04:41:53.680
These are some strict reporting forms, some numbered documents and everything else.

04:41:54.680 --> 04:41:59.680
So, what kind of accounting is determined?

04:42:05.680 --> 04:42:07.680
What is it about?

04:42:07.680 --> 04:42:10.680
There are two options for accounting documents.

04:42:10.680 --> 04:42:15.680
It can be manual accounting or automated accounting.

04:42:15.680 --> 04:42:22.680
One of the distinguishing features of the confidential case of production is strict accounting control.

04:42:23.680 --> 04:42:25.680
Any document that is created,

04:42:25.680 --> 04:42:28.680
it is assigned a number, it must be registered,

04:42:28.680 --> 04:42:33.680
the number of copies that are taken from it must be determined,

04:42:33.680 --> 04:42:36.680
which officials can get acquainted with it.

04:42:36.680 --> 04:42:38.680
If Ivanov gave it to Petrov,

04:42:38.680 --> 04:42:43.680
it means that it is necessary to clearly record that at that time Ivanov gave the document to Petrov.

04:42:43.680 --> 04:42:45.680
That is, strict accounting control.

04:42:45.680 --> 04:42:49.680
It can be handled in a manual version,

04:42:49.680 --> 04:42:53.680
that is, in the form of various magazines, registers, notes, and so on.

04:42:53.680 --> 04:42:55.680
It can be handled in an electronic version.

04:42:55.680 --> 04:43:02.680
Now there are quite a lot of products that are handled in an electronic version of the confidential case of production.

04:43:05.680 --> 04:43:07.680
This must be determined.

04:43:07.680 --> 04:43:14.680
It is determined, let's say, how to create.

04:43:14.680 --> 04:43:16.680
How to create?

04:43:16.680 --> 04:43:19.680
It is about two options,

04:43:19.680 --> 04:43:26.680
separately or on the basis of the open one.

04:43:26.680 --> 04:43:31.680
It is clear that in any company there is an open case of production.

04:43:31.680 --> 04:43:33.680
There is a case of production gospel,

04:43:33.680 --> 04:43:37.680
where documents are written, how to design, how to create, how to send.

04:43:37.680 --> 04:43:42.680
The confidential case of production can be created on the basis of the open case of production,

04:43:42.680 --> 04:43:46.680
that is, some information sections are allocated, which are closed,

04:43:46.680 --> 04:43:48.680
safes are inserted, and so on.

04:43:48.680 --> 04:43:54.680
This is the first option, it is perhaps the simplest and most common.

04:43:54.680 --> 04:43:58.680
The second option is to create a confidential case of production separately,

04:43:58.680 --> 04:44:01.680
that is, in no way connected with the open case of production.

04:44:01.680 --> 04:44:04.680
This option is also possible, there are pluses and minuses,

04:44:04.680 --> 04:44:06.680
you need to proceed with a specific situation.

04:44:06.680 --> 04:44:10.680
What is determined?

04:44:11.680 --> 04:44:13.680
How are documents created?

04:44:13.680 --> 04:44:17.680
How and where are they created?

04:44:19.680 --> 04:44:21.680
Some premises are determined,

04:44:21.680 --> 04:44:24.680
where you can create a confidential case of production.

04:44:24.680 --> 04:44:29.680
The officials who can create documents are determined.

04:44:29.680 --> 04:44:31.680
The means of protection are established,

04:44:31.680 --> 04:44:35.680
technical means, all sorts of, say, alarms, and so on.

04:44:35.680 --> 04:44:41.680
It is determined how to store, how to create,

04:44:41.680 --> 04:44:48.680
how to create, how to store confidential documents.

04:44:48.680 --> 04:44:50.680
Well, the storage is generally clear,

04:44:50.680 --> 04:44:58.680
the main goal here is to make it so that the unauthorized persons

04:44:58.680 --> 04:45:00.680
exclude access to these documents.

04:45:00.680 --> 04:45:03.680
Basically, these are either safes or systems,

04:45:03.680 --> 04:45:06.680
say, some kind of metal cabinets.

04:45:06.680 --> 04:45:11.680
Everything depends on the need, value, and safety of these documents.

04:45:11.680 --> 04:45:21.680
In terms of storage, the moment of destruction of documents is determined.

04:45:25.680 --> 04:45:28.680
There are different approaches to destruction.

04:45:28.680 --> 04:45:33.680
The classic option is destruction in shredders,

04:45:33.680 --> 04:45:36.680
special machines for shredding documents.

04:45:36.680 --> 04:45:38.680
They come in different classes.

04:45:40.680 --> 04:45:44.680
There are shredders that cut a sheet of paper only along,

04:45:44.680 --> 04:45:48.680
and there are shredders that cut a sheet of paper not only along, but also across.

04:45:48.680 --> 04:45:54.680
There are shredders that are guaranteed not to be restored.

04:45:54.680 --> 04:45:57.680
That is, they cut such a small number of particles,

04:45:57.680 --> 04:45:59.680
A4, in my opinion, for 15,000 parts.

04:45:59.680 --> 04:46:05.680
Basically, they cut a standard sheet of A4 into powder.

04:46:07.680 --> 04:46:12.680
I would recommend using shredders that are guaranteed not to be restored,

04:46:12.680 --> 04:46:15.680
that is, those that cut not only along, but also across.

04:46:15.680 --> 04:46:19.680
If necessary, you can buy large shredders.

04:46:19.680 --> 04:46:23.680
There are shredders that can destroy a whole pack of papers at once.

04:46:24.680 --> 04:46:28.680
They are expensive, but the principle is the same.

04:46:28.680 --> 04:46:31.680
The same knives, just bigger, and the same motors, only more powerful.

04:46:33.680 --> 04:46:37.680
They are expensive, but if necessary, there are also such shredders.

04:46:39.680 --> 04:46:43.680
I would recommend setting up a rule in the company,

04:46:43.680 --> 04:46:49.680
which says that any company documents should be destroyed using shredders.

04:46:49.680 --> 04:46:54.680
Because as soon as you start to determine that these documents can be put in a garbage basket,

04:46:54.680 --> 04:46:57.680
these documents can be put in shredders,

04:46:57.680 --> 04:47:00.680
usually, again, taking into account the human factor,

04:47:00.680 --> 04:47:04.680
someone will confuse something, someone will throw something wrong.

04:47:04.680 --> 04:47:10.680
Therefore, it may make sense to determine that all documents are destroyed using shredders.

04:47:11.680 --> 04:47:20.680
And garbage baskets are intended for apple peels, banana peels, empty cans of beer, etc.

04:47:21.680 --> 04:47:25.680
Here is what I would like to draw your attention to in relation to the destruction of documents.

04:47:25.680 --> 04:47:30.680
This is a collegiality of destruction.

04:47:32.680 --> 04:47:37.680
It may make sense to make such a procedure in the organization,

04:47:37.680 --> 04:47:41.680
that some confidential documents are destroyed collegially.

04:47:41.680 --> 04:47:43.680
That is, a commission is created,

04:47:43.680 --> 04:47:47.680
this can be the executor of the document and the security service employee,

04:47:47.680 --> 04:47:55.680
who is signed that this sheet of paper was not turned into a tube and not taken out,

04:47:55.680 --> 04:47:57.680
but it was destroyed.

04:47:58.680 --> 04:48:03.680
This may be unacceptable in many companies,

04:48:03.680 --> 04:48:09.680
because it is a bureaucratic procedure, it distracts the forces of the means.

04:48:09.680 --> 04:48:14.680
But in some situations and according to some confidential documents, this is probably possible.

04:48:15.680 --> 04:48:17.680
This is for destruction.

04:48:17.680 --> 04:48:19.680
You can destroy documents by burning,

04:48:19.680 --> 04:48:24.680
although it is probably convenient when there are a lot of documents.

04:48:24.680 --> 04:48:29.680
If there are not many documents, it makes sense to use shredders.

04:48:30.680 --> 04:48:36.680
In relation to the destruction of documents, what else is determined?

04:48:37.680 --> 04:48:45.680
As a rule, the order of the transfer of confidential documents is determined.

04:48:46.680 --> 04:48:48.680
Here, what I will draw your attention to,

04:48:48.680 --> 04:48:53.680
in any case, there will be a need to transfer some confidential documents,

04:48:53.680 --> 04:48:55.680
move some documents,

04:48:55.680 --> 04:48:58.680
some documents will be taken by the management to work at home.

04:48:58.680 --> 04:49:00.680
Unfortunately, this is an objective reality.

04:49:00.680 --> 04:49:05.680
Ideally, the document should not go beyond the controlled room.

04:49:05.680 --> 04:49:10.680
But life is multifaceted, and this is why such situations arise.

04:49:10.680 --> 04:49:13.680
You can foresee such situations,

04:49:13.680 --> 04:49:20.680
and it makes sense to determine some order of transferring documents from the controlled territory.

04:49:20.680 --> 04:49:24.680
In the vast majority of cases, a certain permission is required.

04:49:24.680 --> 04:49:25.680
How is it determined?

04:49:25.680 --> 04:49:26.680
A permission is required.

04:49:26.680 --> 04:49:30.680
The official who gives this permission is required.

04:49:33.680 --> 04:49:36.680
When moving between objects,

04:49:36.680 --> 04:49:41.680
usually several people move the confidential document in their car.

04:49:41.680 --> 04:49:45.680
That is, a driver goes, a person with a document goes.

04:49:47.680 --> 04:49:50.680
It is forbidden for them to deviate from the route,

04:49:50.680 --> 04:49:52.680
it is forbidden to take passengers,

04:49:52.680 --> 04:49:54.680
it is forbidden to enter some five-star hotels.

04:49:54.680 --> 04:49:58.680
But there should be an order of transfer plus an order of movement.

04:50:02.680 --> 04:50:10.680
The order of movement is beyond the control zone.

04:50:11.680 --> 04:50:20.680
Usually, the order of transferring confidential documents is determined.

04:50:29.680 --> 04:50:33.680
The order of transferring confidential documents is about the provision,

04:50:33.680 --> 04:50:36.680
for example, within the framework of some verification activities.

04:50:37.680 --> 04:50:40.680
We are talking about the creation of certain algorithms in action.

04:50:40.680 --> 04:50:47.680
For example, a tax office, a police, a fire brigade, or anyone else comes.

04:50:47.680 --> 04:50:51.680
They can require certain documents within the framework of verification activities.

04:50:51.680 --> 04:50:57.680
What is the order of providing these documents within the framework of verification activities?

04:50:57.680 --> 04:51:00.680
This order must be regulated, determined.

04:51:00.680 --> 04:51:04.680
It should not go beyond the framework of the current legislation.

04:51:04.680 --> 04:51:09.680
But in order to regulate it, it is necessary to introduce a certain order,

04:51:09.680 --> 04:51:11.680
that is, there must be some kind of instruction.

04:51:12.680 --> 04:51:17.680
Here you can include the order of providing information,

04:51:17.680 --> 04:51:19.680
for example, in the Internet resource,

04:51:19.680 --> 04:51:22.680
the order of providing confidential information,

04:51:22.680 --> 04:51:26.680
for example, at some negotiations, at some exhibition events.

04:51:26.680 --> 04:51:29.680
That is, it is the confidential documents.

04:51:30.680 --> 04:51:36.680
And, probably, a certain control is determined.

04:51:38.680 --> 04:51:41.680
Control over the confidential production.

04:51:41.680 --> 04:51:44.680
Control can be…

04:51:44.680 --> 04:51:52.680
Well, I have already said that various control measures can go both planned and unplanned.

04:51:52.680 --> 04:51:57.680
Control over the copying and multiplying technique,

04:51:57.680 --> 04:52:02.680
control over multiplication, printing, sending documents.

04:52:02.680 --> 04:52:08.680
Unfortunately, the modern office is flooded with various copying and multiplying techniques.

04:52:08.680 --> 04:52:13.680
Any confidential document does not imply unauthorized multiplication.

04:52:13.680 --> 04:52:17.680
Therefore, it is necessary to clearly track the number of copies made,

04:52:17.680 --> 04:52:20.680
who met which copy and where they are.

04:52:21.680 --> 04:52:24.680
Therefore, there must be a certain control.

04:52:24.680 --> 04:52:28.680
Technical means are also included here.

04:52:28.680 --> 04:52:31.680
Control over the copying of information from the computer,

04:52:31.680 --> 04:52:34.680
for example, on the movement of documents on the network,

04:52:34.680 --> 04:52:37.680
on the sending of confidential documents,

04:52:37.680 --> 04:52:41.680
for example, by email, and so on.

04:52:42.680 --> 04:52:45.680
I would probably include control here,

04:52:45.680 --> 04:52:51.680
and the question of who will be subject to the confidential production.

04:52:51.680 --> 04:52:56.680
That is, the management of the company must have a certain designated official,

04:52:56.680 --> 04:52:59.680
to whom the confidential production will be closed.

04:52:59.680 --> 04:53:03.680
That is, who will solve the issues of the confidential production.

04:53:03.680 --> 04:53:08.680
Because, as a rule, there are a lot of issues and problems in the confidential production,

04:53:08.680 --> 04:53:13.680
which require solutions, including at the level of the management.

04:53:14.680 --> 04:53:17.680
This is the confidential production.

04:53:17.680 --> 04:53:20.680
When all these issues are determined,

04:53:20.680 --> 04:53:23.680
the confidential production is created,

04:53:23.680 --> 04:53:26.680
the necessary equipment is purchased,

04:53:26.680 --> 04:53:29.680
the necessary regulatory documents are created,

04:53:29.680 --> 04:53:32.680
personnel training is carried out,

04:53:32.680 --> 04:53:39.680
and then this system, when properly operated, should work.

04:53:40.680 --> 04:53:46.680
Here, look at the automated systems of the confidential production on the market.

04:53:46.680 --> 04:53:50.680
They are presented, they are configured for a specific organization,

04:53:50.680 --> 04:53:53.680
they can be sold as scramble systems.

04:53:53.680 --> 04:53:56.680
Therefore, the issues that are solved,

04:53:56.680 --> 04:54:03.680
they must be solved in accordance with the answers to the issues that you have set for yourself.

04:54:09.680 --> 04:54:12.680
Economic security

04:54:12.680 --> 04:54:17.680
The next topic that we will discuss is economic security.

04:54:17.680 --> 04:54:22.680
I will remind you that economic security,

04:54:22.680 --> 04:54:25.680
economic security,

04:54:25.680 --> 04:54:30.680
in fact, is the security of business processes that take place in the company.

04:54:30.680 --> 04:54:34.680
It is built in several directions.

04:54:34.680 --> 04:54:37.680
This is business intelligence.

04:54:38.680 --> 04:54:41.680
Business intelligence.

04:54:41.680 --> 04:54:44.680
This is information and analytical work.

04:54:44.680 --> 04:54:49.680
This is analysis and risk management.

04:54:51.680 --> 04:54:54.680
Economic risks.

04:54:56.680 --> 04:55:00.680
This is protection against fraud.

04:55:03.680 --> 04:55:06.680
Protection against fraud.

04:55:08.680 --> 04:55:13.680
This can be protection against hostile absorption.

04:55:18.680 --> 04:55:21.680
Hostile absorption.

04:55:23.680 --> 04:55:27.680
This can be protection against some illegal actions,

04:55:27.680 --> 04:55:30.680
depending on the company's activities.

04:55:30.680 --> 04:55:33.680
If this is the financial sphere,

04:55:33.680 --> 04:55:36.680
then protection against illegal actions,

04:55:36.680 --> 04:55:39.680
such as non-return of loans,

04:55:39.680 --> 04:55:42.680
with plastic cards,

04:55:42.680 --> 04:55:45.680
with fraud in plastic cards, etc.

04:55:45.680 --> 04:55:48.680
This is more protection against fraud.

04:55:48.680 --> 04:55:51.680
Economic security.

04:55:51.680 --> 04:55:54.680
This topic is very extensive.

04:55:54.680 --> 04:55:57.680
I can talk for hours about economic security.

04:55:57.680 --> 04:56:00.680
I will probably stop at one direction,

04:56:00.680 --> 04:56:03.680
and I will talk about business intelligence.

04:56:05.680 --> 04:56:08.680
Business intelligence.

04:56:09.680 --> 04:56:12.680
There are different interpretations.

04:56:12.680 --> 04:56:15.680
There is corporate intelligence,

04:56:15.680 --> 04:56:18.680
there is competitive intelligence,

04:56:18.680 --> 04:56:21.680
there is business intelligence.

04:56:21.680 --> 04:56:24.680
In fact, business intelligence is built in two directions.

04:56:24.680 --> 04:56:27.680
This is information work.

04:56:28.680 --> 04:56:31.680
This is analytical work.

04:56:39.680 --> 04:56:42.680
This is a kind of information collection,

04:56:42.680 --> 04:56:45.680
and this is done exclusively by legal means.

04:56:45.680 --> 04:56:48.680
Business intelligence does not engage in illegal methods.

04:56:48.680 --> 04:56:51.680
Information collection is also industrial espionage.

04:56:51.680 --> 04:56:54.680
There may be non-ethical methods,

04:56:54.680 --> 04:56:57.680
but legal ones.

04:56:57.680 --> 04:57:00.680
Analytical work is done from the point of view of business intelligence.

04:57:00.680 --> 04:57:03.680
There are two directions in business intelligence.

04:57:03.680 --> 04:57:06.680
The first direction is strategic.

04:57:15.680 --> 04:57:18.680
The second direction is operational.

04:57:18.680 --> 04:57:21.680
The third direction is strategic.

04:57:24.680 --> 04:57:27.680
What is a strategic direction?

04:57:27.680 --> 04:57:30.680
It is a solution of strategic tasks

04:57:30.680 --> 04:57:33.680
from the perspective of the security of the organization.

04:57:33.680 --> 04:57:36.680
What do I mean by strategic tasks?

04:57:36.680 --> 04:57:39.680
This is the analysis of the legislation

04:57:39.680 --> 04:57:42.680
from the point of view of a particular company,

04:57:42.680 --> 04:57:45.680
that is, in the field of activity of a particular company.

04:57:46.680 --> 04:57:49.680
This is an analysis of the competitive environment,

04:57:49.680 --> 04:57:52.680
that is, what companies exist in this market,

04:57:52.680 --> 04:57:55.680
how they develop, what threats they pose.

04:57:55.680 --> 04:57:58.680
This is an analysis of the market as a whole,

04:57:58.680 --> 04:58:01.680
the analysis of the possibility of the emergence of some products or substitutes,

04:58:01.680 --> 04:58:04.680
the analysis of some resources of this market,

04:58:04.680 --> 04:58:07.680
the analysis of the needs of this market.

04:58:07.680 --> 04:58:10.680
These are quite similar things

04:58:10.680 --> 04:58:13.680
from the point of view of strategic planning.

04:58:14.680 --> 04:58:17.680
Although business intelligence

04:58:17.680 --> 04:58:20.680
is about threats and risks.

04:58:20.680 --> 04:58:23.680
Strategic planning can come from the point of view of profit,

04:58:23.680 --> 04:58:26.680
business intelligence comes from the point of view of threats.

04:58:29.680 --> 04:58:32.680
The operational direction is a private local direction.

04:58:34.680 --> 04:58:37.680
Usually, it is about checking a particular company,

04:58:37.680 --> 04:58:40.680
a particular organization.

04:58:41.680 --> 04:58:44.680
You want to conclude an agreement with a particular organization,

04:58:44.680 --> 04:58:47.680
you want to see what kind of organization it is,

04:58:47.680 --> 04:58:50.680
what it is like,

04:58:50.680 --> 04:58:53.680
whether it will pay for its obligations,

04:58:53.680 --> 04:58:56.680
who is behind this company,

04:58:56.680 --> 04:58:59.680
and how decent this company is.

04:58:59.680 --> 04:59:02.680
This is a so-called payment capability check,

04:59:02.680 --> 04:59:05.680
or partner reliability.

04:59:05.680 --> 04:59:08.680
This is a local operational direction.

04:59:09.680 --> 04:59:12.680
Information is collected for negotiations.

04:59:12.680 --> 04:59:15.680
That is, it is planned to carry out some negotiations

04:59:15.680 --> 04:59:18.680
with a person or an organization.

04:59:18.680 --> 04:59:21.680
Information is collected for negotiations.

04:59:21.680 --> 04:59:24.680
Or, in the vast majority of cases,

04:59:24.680 --> 04:59:27.680
this is a collection of information before concluding a deal.

04:59:27.680 --> 04:59:30.680
If you work as a swordsman's watchman,

04:59:30.680 --> 04:59:33.680
in a twelve-chair,

04:59:33.680 --> 04:59:36.680
in the morning money, in the evening chair,

04:59:36.680 --> 04:59:39.680
this is very relevant.

04:59:39.680 --> 04:59:42.680
If you work with the source,

04:59:42.680 --> 04:59:45.680
that is, first you send money somewhere,

04:59:45.680 --> 04:59:48.680
then you wait for some product,

04:59:48.680 --> 04:59:51.680
or vice versa, you send a product,

04:59:51.680 --> 04:59:54.680
then you wait for money,

04:59:54.680 --> 04:59:57.680
then it makes sense to check

04:59:57.680 --> 05:00:00.680
whether the organization will pay for the debts that do not exist.

05:00:00.680 --> 05:00:03.680
There are stages of business intelligence.

05:00:06.680 --> 05:00:09.680
I will dwell on them a little.

05:00:09.680 --> 05:00:12.680
The first stage is the task setting.

05:00:17.680 --> 05:00:20.680
The more correct and clear you set the task,

05:00:20.680 --> 05:00:23.680
the easier and cheaper it will be

05:00:23.680 --> 05:00:26.680
to go into business intelligence.

05:00:26.680 --> 05:00:29.680
Because the task must always be set clearly

05:00:29.680 --> 05:00:32.680
based on the questions

05:00:32.680 --> 05:00:35.680
you want to get an answer to.

05:00:35.680 --> 05:00:38.680
This is about the same as the lie detector test,

05:00:38.680 --> 05:00:41.680
which I talked about in the security video.

05:00:41.680 --> 05:00:44.680
That is, you can't just test a person on a lie detector.

05:00:44.680 --> 05:00:47.680
As a rule, they test the answer to some questions.

05:00:47.680 --> 05:00:50.680
The same cannot be done

05:00:50.680 --> 05:00:53.680
when you ask to collect all the information

05:00:53.680 --> 05:00:56.680
from some company,

05:00:56.680 --> 05:00:59.680
but it will be completely useless for use.

05:00:59.680 --> 05:01:02.680
That is, you need to set the task in the following way.

05:01:02.680 --> 05:01:05.680
Collect the information I need

05:01:05.680 --> 05:01:08.680
to make a decision.

05:01:08.680 --> 05:01:11.680
The decision may be to sign a contract with this company

05:01:11.680 --> 05:01:14.680
or not.

05:01:14.680 --> 05:01:17.680
The information is collected and analytical work is carried out

05:01:17.680 --> 05:01:20.680
from the point of view of the organization's payability.

05:01:20.680 --> 05:01:23.680
You need to pay attention to this

05:01:23.680 --> 05:01:26.680
because you need to set the question very clearly and correctly.

05:01:26.680 --> 05:01:29.680
The second stage is the information collection.

05:01:32.680 --> 05:01:35.680
There are different methods of collecting information.

05:01:35.680 --> 05:01:38.680
I will talk about them in more detail.

05:01:38.680 --> 05:01:41.680
That is, they collect information

05:01:41.680 --> 05:01:44.680
in various methods.

05:01:44.680 --> 05:01:47.680
The third stage is the evaluation of information.

05:01:56.680 --> 05:01:59.680
This is about translating it into information.

05:02:00.680 --> 05:02:03.680
Information is some kind of information.

05:02:03.680 --> 05:02:06.680
To make a decision, it is pointless to collect information.

05:02:06.680 --> 05:02:09.680
You need to collect it,

05:02:09.680 --> 05:02:12.680
evaluate it and transfer the information to the data.

05:02:12.680 --> 05:02:15.680
The data is different from the information

05:02:15.680 --> 05:02:18.680
because the data is already evaluated.

05:02:18.680 --> 05:02:21.680
The evaluation can take place in different directions.

05:02:21.680 --> 05:02:24.680
From the point of view of reliability,

05:02:24.680 --> 05:02:27.680
completeness, relevance,

05:02:27.680 --> 05:02:30.680
secrecy, reliability of the source and so on.

05:02:33.680 --> 05:02:36.680
The fourth stage is the analysis.

05:02:39.680 --> 05:02:42.680
After the information is translated into the data,

05:02:42.680 --> 05:02:45.680
analytical work is carried out based on this data.

05:02:45.680 --> 05:02:48.680
Again, this is done to answer the questions

05:02:48.680 --> 05:02:51.680
that are initially put in the task.

05:02:53.680 --> 05:02:56.680
The fifth stage is the preparation of conclusions.

05:02:57.680 --> 05:03:00.680
The preparation of conclusions is usually done

05:03:00.680 --> 05:03:03.680
in the form of a certain document.

05:03:03.680 --> 05:03:06.680
This is an information-analytical note,

05:03:06.680 --> 05:03:09.680
a reference.

05:03:09.680 --> 05:03:12.680
It is made up of two parts.

05:03:12.680 --> 05:03:15.680
This is the information part.

05:03:15.680 --> 05:03:18.680
The information that has been collected

05:03:18.680 --> 05:03:21.680
is stated here.

05:03:21.680 --> 05:03:24.680
The information is then collected

05:03:24.680 --> 05:03:27.680
and the information that has been collected is stated.

05:03:27.680 --> 05:03:30.680
This is either information or certain information.

05:03:30.680 --> 05:03:33.680
The part that is dedicated to the answers to those questions.

05:03:33.680 --> 05:03:36.680
The conclusions should be the answer

05:03:36.680 --> 05:03:39.680
to the questions that were asked.

05:03:42.680 --> 05:03:45.680
Here you need to start from the fact

05:03:45.680 --> 05:03:48.680
that business intelligence

05:03:48.680 --> 05:03:51.680
is a prediction of the future.

05:03:51.680 --> 05:03:54.680
An attempt to find out what will happen.

05:03:54.680 --> 05:03:57.680
Will the organization pay its debts?

05:03:57.680 --> 05:04:00.680
Will it fulfill its obligations?

05:04:00.680 --> 05:04:03.680
Or not?

05:04:03.680 --> 05:04:06.680
Therefore, the conclusions are usually not categorical.

05:04:06.680 --> 05:04:09.680
Certain terminologies are carried out.

05:04:09.680 --> 05:04:12.680
The most likely is the possibility.

05:04:12.680 --> 05:04:15.680
If you can calculate the percentage,

05:04:15.680 --> 05:04:18.680
the percentage is calculated.

05:04:18.680 --> 05:04:21.680
It is difficult to calculate the percentage.

05:04:21.680 --> 05:04:24.680
This is possible when you can apply

05:04:24.680 --> 05:04:27.680
mathematical calculations or statistics.

05:04:27.680 --> 05:04:30.680
There is a poll at the elections.

05:04:30.680 --> 05:04:33.680
You can say that a certain percentage

05:04:33.680 --> 05:04:36.680
will vote for Ivanov and Ivan Ivanovich.

05:04:36.680 --> 05:04:39.680
You can make a certain percentage

05:04:39.680 --> 05:04:42.680
based on statistics in an information-analytical note.

05:04:42.680 --> 05:04:45.680
If this cannot be done,

05:04:45.680 --> 05:04:48.680
then you can use terminologies.

05:04:48.680 --> 05:04:51.680
This is a gradation of the five-point system.

05:04:51.680 --> 05:04:54.680
Very likely, likely, unlikely,

05:04:54.680 --> 05:04:57.680
unlikely.

05:04:57.680 --> 05:05:00.680
Again, it depends on how you look at it.

05:05:00.680 --> 05:05:03.680
You can look at a bottle half empty

05:05:03.680 --> 05:05:06.680
or a bottle half full.

05:05:06.680 --> 05:05:09.680
You can say that Ivanov and Ivan Ivanovich

05:05:09.680 --> 05:05:12.680
will win the elections with a 50% chance.

05:05:12.680 --> 05:05:15.680
Petrov and Petrovich will win with a 50% chance.

05:05:15.680 --> 05:05:18.680
Therefore, you should be careful

05:05:18.680 --> 05:05:21.680
with conclusions.

05:05:21.680 --> 05:05:24.680
It is desirable to do so,

05:05:24.680 --> 05:05:27.680
so that later it is not so shameful

05:05:27.680 --> 05:05:30.680
for the conclusions you have presented.

05:05:30.680 --> 05:05:33.680
I will focus on two things.

05:05:33.680 --> 05:05:36.680
This is information collection and information analysis.

05:05:36.680 --> 05:05:39.680
What are the methods of information collection?

05:05:39.680 --> 05:05:42.680
There are so-called office methods.

05:05:42.680 --> 05:05:45.680
They are easy to access.

05:05:45.680 --> 05:05:48.680
What do I include here?

05:05:48.680 --> 05:05:51.680
These are various media

05:05:51.680 --> 05:05:54.680
that can be easily obtained

05:05:54.680 --> 05:05:57.680
by using the information collection

05:05:57.680 --> 05:06:00.680
and information analysis.

05:06:00.680 --> 05:06:03.680
I will not go into details.

05:06:03.680 --> 05:06:06.680
I will just show you

05:06:06.680 --> 05:06:09.680
the methods of information collection.

05:06:09.680 --> 05:06:12.680
Here is the Internet.

05:06:12.680 --> 05:06:15.680
There is a large number of Internet resources

05:06:15.680 --> 05:06:18.680
that can be used for business intelligence.

05:06:18.680 --> 05:06:21.680
You can include various books, CD-ROMs,

05:06:21.680 --> 05:06:24.680
databases, etc.

05:06:24.680 --> 05:06:27.680
These are the methods that can be used

05:06:27.680 --> 05:06:30.680
for obtaining information without leaving the office.

05:06:30.680 --> 05:06:33.680
There is a concept of office hard-to-access methods.

05:06:37.680 --> 05:06:40.680
Office hard-to-access methods.

05:06:43.680 --> 05:06:46.680
This is about collecting this information

05:06:46.680 --> 05:06:49.680
without leaving the office.

05:06:58.680 --> 05:07:01.680
There are certain difficulties

05:07:01.680 --> 05:07:04.680
in obtaining this information.

05:07:04.680 --> 05:07:07.680
For example, there are some information arrays

05:07:07.680 --> 05:07:10.680
that are difficult to read.

05:07:10.680 --> 05:07:13.680
They are in Chinese.

05:07:13.680 --> 05:07:16.680
They can be translated,

05:07:16.680 --> 05:07:19.680
but it requires some effort.

05:07:19.680 --> 05:07:22.680
For example, the translator's effort is required.

05:07:22.680 --> 05:07:25.680
There can be some closed reports,

05:07:25.680 --> 05:07:28.680
some unpublished collections or reference books, etc.

05:07:29.680 --> 05:07:32.680
There are methods that require

05:07:32.680 --> 05:07:35.680
leaving the office.

05:07:35.680 --> 05:07:38.680
They are called field methods.

05:07:46.680 --> 05:07:49.680
What I mean by field methods

05:07:49.680 --> 05:07:52.680
is various surveys, interviews,

05:07:52.680 --> 05:07:55.680
exhibitions, observations, presentations.

05:07:56.680 --> 05:07:59.680
You can come to a research firm,

05:07:59.680 --> 05:08:02.680
observe the company's activities

05:08:02.680 --> 05:08:05.680
for a certain period of time.

05:08:05.680 --> 05:08:08.680
You can understand whether this firm is alive or not.

05:08:08.680 --> 05:08:11.680
You can understand whether someone leaves the firm

05:08:11.680 --> 05:08:14.680
or not, whether some cars enter the firm

05:08:14.680 --> 05:08:17.680
or not.

05:08:17.680 --> 05:08:20.680
You can understand the number of cars

05:08:20.680 --> 05:08:23.680
that leave the firm, etc.

05:08:24.680 --> 05:08:27.680
There are so-called operational methods.

05:08:35.680 --> 05:08:38.680
What do they imply?

05:08:38.680 --> 05:08:41.680
They imply the implementation of certain

05:08:41.680 --> 05:08:44.680
operational events.

05:08:44.680 --> 05:08:47.680
These are events related to certain games.

05:08:47.680 --> 05:08:50.680
This is an example of a game

05:08:50.680 --> 05:08:53.680
or a visit to a restaurant

05:08:53.680 --> 05:08:56.680
and to infuse a person with a drink.

05:08:56.680 --> 05:08:59.680
These are also operational methods.

05:08:59.680 --> 05:09:02.680
A meeting of a light chess player

05:09:02.680 --> 05:09:05.680
with the company's secretary

05:09:05.680 --> 05:09:08.680
is also an operational method.

05:09:11.680 --> 05:09:14.680
There are so-called expert methods.

05:09:20.680 --> 05:09:23.680
Expert methods imply the attraction of experts.

05:09:23.680 --> 05:09:26.680
There is a number of organizations

05:09:26.680 --> 05:09:29.680
that provide information resources.

05:09:29.680 --> 05:09:32.680
There are many information companies

05:09:32.680 --> 05:09:35.680
that can collect information

05:09:35.680 --> 05:09:38.680
about a particular organization,

05:09:38.680 --> 05:09:41.680
conduct analysis of the region,

05:09:41.680 --> 05:09:44.680
industry, etc.

05:09:50.680 --> 05:09:53.680
I would like to draw your attention

05:09:53.680 --> 05:09:56.680
to the following point.

05:09:56.680 --> 05:09:59.680
We have official methods

05:09:59.680 --> 05:10:02.680
of obtaining information

05:10:02.680 --> 05:10:05.680
from state bodies.

05:10:05.680 --> 05:10:08.680
Unlike personal data,

05:10:08.680 --> 05:10:11.680
there are official channels

05:10:11.680 --> 05:10:14.680
of obtaining information

05:10:14.680 --> 05:10:17.680
from state bodies by legal entities.

05:10:18.680 --> 05:10:21.680
This can be obtained

05:10:21.680 --> 05:10:24.680
from the Tax Service,

05:10:24.680 --> 05:10:27.680
from the Spark information database,

05:10:27.680 --> 05:10:30.680
a professional system

05:10:30.680 --> 05:10:33.680
for analyzing markets and companies.

05:10:33.680 --> 05:10:36.680
There is an opportunity

05:10:36.680 --> 05:10:39.680
to obtain official information

05:10:39.680 --> 05:10:42.680
from the Redina State Register

05:10:42.680 --> 05:10:45.680
on real estate.

05:10:45.680 --> 05:10:48.680
There is an opportunity

05:10:48.680 --> 05:10:51.680
to obtain official information

05:10:51.680 --> 05:10:54.680
from the Trade and Industry Chamber database.

05:10:54.680 --> 05:10:57.680
There are many Internet resources

05:10:57.680 --> 05:11:00.680
for obtaining information

05:11:00.680 --> 05:11:03.680
from the official website

05:11:03.680 --> 05:11:06.680
and from the state websites

05:11:06.680 --> 05:11:09.680
and specialized websites

05:11:09.680 --> 05:11:12.680
that provide information

05:11:12.680 --> 05:11:15.680
about a particular organization

05:11:15.680 --> 05:11:18.680
or specific areas of activity.

05:11:18.680 --> 05:11:21.680
There are information resources

05:11:21.680 --> 05:11:24.680
in the form of professional databases.

05:11:24.680 --> 05:11:27.680
For example,

05:11:27.680 --> 05:11:30.680
there is a company called LexisNexis

05:11:30.680 --> 05:11:33.680
and there is a company called

05:11:33.680 --> 05:11:36.680
Dunton Brandstreet.

05:11:36.680 --> 05:11:39.680
These are international databases

05:11:39.680 --> 05:11:42.680
that provide information

05:11:42.680 --> 05:11:45.680
and can be used to obtain information.

05:11:45.680 --> 05:11:48.680
There is a professional database

05:11:48.680 --> 05:11:51.680
on the Russian market.

05:11:51.680 --> 05:11:54.680
There is a company called SINZ,

05:11:54.680 --> 05:11:57.680
Lex, Lines, RIP, Integrum,

05:11:57.680 --> 05:12:00.680
Intralex, Astarte, and many more.

05:12:01.680 --> 05:12:04.680
There is a database

05:12:04.680 --> 05:12:07.680
that is not official

05:12:07.680 --> 05:12:10.680
and is presented on the Russian market.

05:12:10.680 --> 05:12:13.680
It can be used to obtain information

05:12:13.680 --> 05:12:16.680
about companies that are interested.

05:12:16.680 --> 05:12:19.680
It includes manufacturers of goods and services,

05:12:19.680 --> 05:12:22.680
statistical reporting,

05:12:22.680 --> 05:12:25.680
labyrinth, customs, press,

05:12:25.680 --> 05:12:28.680
registration room,

05:12:29.680 --> 05:12:32.680
and many more.

05:12:32.680 --> 05:12:35.680
At least, it can be used

05:12:35.680 --> 05:12:38.680
as a channel to obtain information.

05:12:38.680 --> 05:12:41.680
Now I will draw an analytical work

05:12:41.680 --> 05:12:44.680
in a few words.

05:12:48.680 --> 05:12:51.680
In general,

05:12:51.680 --> 05:12:54.680
the work of an analytical

05:12:54.680 --> 05:12:57.680
is more complex

05:12:58.680 --> 05:13:01.680
than the work of an information specialist.

05:13:01.680 --> 05:13:04.680
It is more difficult

05:13:04.680 --> 05:13:07.680
to find a good analyst

05:13:07.680 --> 05:13:10.680
than a good information specialist.

05:13:15.680 --> 05:13:18.680
Unfortunately,

05:13:18.680 --> 05:13:21.680
there are not many specialists

05:13:21.680 --> 05:13:24.680
in the field of business intelligence

05:13:24.680 --> 05:13:27.680
and it is much more difficult to find one.

05:13:27.680 --> 05:13:30.680
An analytical work is carried out

05:13:30.680 --> 05:13:33.680
in two directions.

05:13:33.680 --> 05:13:36.680
The first one is the work of an analyst

05:13:36.680 --> 05:13:39.680
as a person.

05:13:44.680 --> 05:13:47.680
The second one is the work

05:13:47.680 --> 05:13:50.680
of automated analytical systems.

05:13:55.680 --> 05:13:58.680
I am quite calm

05:13:58.680 --> 05:14:01.680
about automated analytical systems

05:14:01.680 --> 05:14:04.680
because they cannot replace

05:14:04.680 --> 05:14:07.680
the analytical mind of a person.

05:14:07.680 --> 05:14:10.680
They can work well

05:14:10.680 --> 05:14:13.680
when they are used as a help

05:14:13.680 --> 05:14:16.680
for the work of an analyst.

05:14:16.680 --> 05:14:19.680
The basis should be done

05:14:19.680 --> 05:14:22.680
for the work of an analyst,

05:14:22.680 --> 05:14:25.680
but the automated systems

05:14:25.680 --> 05:14:28.680
can handle the processing

05:14:28.680 --> 05:14:31.680
of large amounts of information.

05:14:31.680 --> 05:14:34.680
They work very well

05:14:34.680 --> 05:14:37.680
when it is necessary

05:14:37.680 --> 05:14:40.680
to process and track the connections

05:14:40.680 --> 05:14:43.680
between a huge number of information resources.

05:14:43.680 --> 05:14:46.680
They work very well

05:14:46.680 --> 05:14:49.680
according to the scenarios.

05:14:49.680 --> 05:14:52.680
If the system is used in a different region

05:14:52.680 --> 05:14:55.680
or in a different country,

05:14:55.680 --> 05:14:58.680
it will tell you that it is working

05:14:58.680 --> 05:15:01.680
according to the scenario.

05:15:01.680 --> 05:15:04.680
Such things are well tracked.

05:15:04.680 --> 05:15:07.680
The disadvantage of automated systems

05:15:07.680 --> 05:15:10.680
is that they do not take into account

05:15:10.680 --> 05:15:13.680
many things that an analyst can take into account

05:15:13.680 --> 05:15:16.680
such as inner feelings, experience,

05:15:16.680 --> 05:15:19.680
voice, intuition, etc.

05:15:19.680 --> 05:15:22.680
It is a machine, it works

05:15:22.680 --> 05:15:25.680
according to a certain algorithm.

05:15:25.680 --> 05:15:28.680
Life is more complicated.

05:15:28.680 --> 05:15:31.680
It should happen

05:15:31.680 --> 05:15:34.680
according to the automated system.

05:15:34.680 --> 05:15:37.680
Ivan Ivanovich went to the sauna

05:15:37.680 --> 05:15:40.680
with Petrov and Petrovich

05:15:40.680 --> 05:15:43.680
and everything began to go a little differently.

05:15:43.680 --> 05:15:46.680
The disadvantage of automated systems

05:15:46.680 --> 05:15:49.680
is that they have a tough result.

05:15:49.680 --> 05:15:52.680
They can estimate some events

05:15:52.680 --> 05:15:55.680
because the automated system

05:15:55.680 --> 05:15:58.680
is a computer, it is a unit of zeros.

05:15:58.680 --> 05:16:01.680
As a result, we can say

05:16:01.680 --> 05:16:04.680
that there will be a scenario A,

05:16:04.680 --> 05:16:07.680
or scenario B, or scenario C.

05:16:07.680 --> 05:16:10.680
We already put the development scenario

05:16:10.680 --> 05:16:13.680
An analyst can say

05:16:13.680 --> 05:16:16.680
that there will be not the same scenarios,

05:16:16.680 --> 05:16:19.680
but scenarios C or E.

05:16:19.680 --> 05:16:22.680
The machine will not be able to do this.

05:16:22.680 --> 05:16:25.680
It is a system that works according to the program.

05:16:25.680 --> 05:16:28.680
It will say that there will be either the first,

05:16:28.680 --> 05:16:31.680
second or third scenario.

05:16:34.680 --> 05:16:37.680
This is the end of our seminar.

05:16:38.680 --> 05:16:41.680
I hope that the information

05:16:41.680 --> 05:16:44.680
that you have learned in this video

05:16:44.680 --> 05:16:47.680
will help you to build an effective

05:16:47.680 --> 05:16:50.680
corporate security system

05:16:50.680 --> 05:16:53.680
and protect yourself from the threats

05:16:53.680 --> 05:16:56.680
that exist in your business.

05:16:56.680 --> 05:16:58.680
Thank you.
