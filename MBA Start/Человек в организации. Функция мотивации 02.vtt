00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Everything we have discussed before is directly related to motivation.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
What is motivation? Let's look at it again.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
In order to make all the tasks set before the organization or before a person

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
during the annual interview or in the planned trial period

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
were achieved, it is not enough to have only a set of qualified personnel.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Really? Why?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Because it is necessary to organize the work in such a way

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
that everyone puts the maximum effort to perform the tasks set.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
And this is already difficult.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
And this is really management.

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
And how to organize the work of people so that they put the maximum effort,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
not to sit at work from one call to another.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
This is already management art.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
By the way, in management courses,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
they read a lot of different subjects.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Marketing, economics, finance.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
All this is very important, all this is necessary.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Without it, it is impossible.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Maybe because I am a director of personnel,

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
so it seems to me that the most important aspect of management is human resources.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
But maybe not only because of this.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Everything that happens is done by human hands and brains.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
If we cannot manage people, we will not be able to manage the economy.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
People make it.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
We will not be able to manage marketing.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
What is marketing?

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
If you buy some product, this product should be delivered by a person.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
If you do not know how to manage these people, who will deliver the information?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Therefore, management of human resources,

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
motivation of these resources is the most important aspect of management.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Successful and unsuccessful managers are those who know how to manage the staff.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
So, let's move on to the motivation function.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
The eternal topic, the infinite.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
We start this infinite topic, the insanely interesting topic.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
What is it interesting about?

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
About the fact that any person wants to feel motivated when he goes to work.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
He wants to do what he likes.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
And to do so and to receive money for it,

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
so that he receives pleasure and satisfaction not only from work, but also from the reward.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
And the company is interesting because it wants to have motivated employees,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
who will work more and more effectively.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
How to achieve this?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Almost like a fairy tale, almost an unfulfilled dream.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
But in some companies it comes true, some companies strive for it.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
One of the problems in today's market,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
which organizations face in the field of stimulating employees,

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
is that two generally known principles are used.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Increase in salary or fired.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
If you don't like it, you can quit.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
We pay like this.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Someone works well, he was paid more.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
That's it.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
There are no other stimuli.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
In principle, you can say, well, what is right?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
A person works for money.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
For the idea, of course, we are interested in a lot of different components when we get to work,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
which we will talk about a little later.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
But salary is an important factor.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Although, as many studies show,

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
salary is not the main criterion of evaluation when a person changes his job.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Look how interesting.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
We often choose a job because we leave one and go to another, where they pay more.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
On the other hand, when we leave a job,

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
the argument that I am leaving where I am paid more is not always the main one.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Even today in large Western companies,

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
managers are best known for some motivation theories.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
Because motivation is a serious, important argument in any company.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
And, of course, to know about various theories, approaches, trends,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
what were, what are now,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
and, in principle, you can even read what will be fashionable and what will be accepted on the market after a while.

04:50.000 --> 05:00.000
Any manager or person who considers his career growth as managerial,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
that is, a soldier who does not want to be a general,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
so any general should know the basics of managing and managing people.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And the most important component is motivation.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
Naturally, high efficiency and adequate stimulation of employees is an important function of management.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And it absolutely cannot be ignored.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
It cannot be made very simple and it cannot be complicated,

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
but it is necessary to have an idea of ​​art of motivation.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And now let's talk about this art.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Question. Why do you work?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Is the question asked correctly?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Or better to ask why do you work in this position?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
From your point of view, which question is more correct?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
If we can answer the first question right away, why do you work?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
The answer is, I work for money.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Then the second question, I work for money in this position,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
is unlikely to be answered by a person right away,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
because he will think about it, why I really work in this position.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Think about it, why do you work in the position you are in now?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Why?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, money is clear, not free.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And why else?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Let's try to answer these questions.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
What motivates you to work in this or that position?

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
Behavior at work can be controlled by external and internal factors.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
The external factor is the stimulus-reaction,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
the internal factor is the behavior of a person at work,

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
and it is controlled by the influence on the inner world of a person, on his needs.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
That is, I work in this position because my needs are being fulfilled,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
I achieve something, I get satisfaction.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
That is, a certain motivation.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Speaking of motivation and the theory of motivation,

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
let's start with the last century.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Capitalism was developing, it was 200 years old,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
100 years have passed, it was developing,

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
and people began to think about why some companies are more successful,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
others are less successful.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
What makes people work more effectively,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
and how many wolves do not feed, but look into the forest.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
How to influence people to work?

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
Naturally, people began to be interested in these issues.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
The very first thing that comes to mind is psychology.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
At the turn of the centuries,

07:54.000 --> 08:02.000
such an interesting science as psychoanalysis appeared.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Psychoanalysis was created at the end of the last century

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
by the Austrian scientist Sigmund Freud.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I think almost everyone knows Freud.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
The personality is odious, the theory is known,

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
although probably more known as the theory of sleep, the theory of sex.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
And few people now even associate it with the theory of psychoanalysis

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
from the point of view of even some motivational things.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Psychoanalysis also arose not from nothing.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
The basis for this is psychology,

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
where psycho is the soul, and logos, as we know, is science.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
This is a science about the patterns of the development and functioning of the psyche.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
Do not confuse it with psychiatry, which deals with the violation of the functioning of the psyche.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
By the way, there are really confused people here.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And psychoanalysis is also not psychiatry.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Freud's successors are the famous Jung,

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
as well as Alfred Alder, and some others.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
In fact, it is probably better to be a successor than to create a direction.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Because, as a rule, the successor always argues with the founder's father.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Therefore, all his successors argued with Freud.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
And the successors, based on his psychoanalysis, created their own theories, their own approaches,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
argued with Freud's postulates.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
But it is Freud who is the father of psychoanalysis.

09:44.000 --> 09:53.000
And, in fact, the theory of human behavior is the first and one of the most influential theories of personality in psychology.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
The theory of personality.

09:55.000 --> 10:06.000
And usually it refers to the classical psychoanalysis created by Sigmund Freud.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
By the way, many people forget about this.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
That it was really a theory of personality in psychology, and this is a classical psychoanalysis.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
The structure of the human psyche is distinguished by two spheres, the conscious and the unconscious.

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
The unconscious is the biological nature of a person and is governed by instincts.

10:30.000 --> 10:40.000
The instinct of self-preservation, for example, which regulates the sensory sphere of natural needs.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
I want to eat, I will go and eat.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Here the fire is dangerous, I will not go there.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
The instinct of self-preservation.

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
And the conscious, which controls the unconscious and determines behavior in the public sphere, in the public environment.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
There is a conflict between the conscious and the unconscious.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Then the balance between the two spheres of the psyche collapses.

11:08.000 --> 11:18.000
Here psychoanalysis helps to understand the problem of this conflict.

11:19.000 --> 11:29.000
The psyche is automatically regulated by the principle of satisfaction, which is modified in the principle of reality.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
And with various violations, a reset is carried out through the unconscious sphere.

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
When some negative information accumulates and I cannot perceive it, I just reset it, I do not refuse it.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
It is not there.

11:46.000 --> 11:58.000
Later Freud worked out his views.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
He conducted a lot of experiments.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
I will not talk about it now, we will not dwell on it.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
But his ego and super ego are really very well known.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
The self and the super self.

12:10.000 --> 12:19.000
The self is a part of a person's personality, which is in contact with the outside world.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
The self and the super self are very interesting qualities.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
This is what a person should do in society.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
This is morality, this is honor, this is shame.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
This is super ego.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Freud distributed such interesting things at different levels.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
That is, I am the world and my morality, shame, honor, conscience.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Probably, conscience will be the key word in the super ego.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
The super ego is my conscience.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
My conscience, through this prism, I look at the world around me.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
In this case, why do we dwell on Freud?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Because he is the father of psychoanalysis.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Many theories of motivation will use him as a basis.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
Naturally, after rethinking, changing, improving, maybe even before recognition.

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
But he is the first brick on which a huge building called the theory of motivation is built.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
At the same time, they lived at the same time.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, Edith von Freud.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
One in Russia, the other in Europe.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, he developed, in general, he is a famous physiologist.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
By the way, he became the first Russian Nobel laureate in 1903.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
He studied the science of higher neural activity.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
I think the first thing that comes to mind when any of us hears the surname Pavlov,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
is the experience with dogs, these are conditional and unconditional reflections.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Again, conscious, unconscious, conditional, unconditional.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Everything is very interconnected.

14:17.000 --> 14:25.000
As at the beginning of the last century, science developed in different countries in approximately the same direction.

14:25.000 --> 14:33.000
Pavlov, the creation of the theory of conditional and unconditional reflections,

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
was another brick on which the Americans built their theories.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
And they called themselves, of course, not they, later they were defined as behaviorists.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
From the English word behave.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
That is, those who studied behavior, conditional and unconditional reflections of behavior.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
So, behaviorism, behavior, one of the directions in psychology.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
If Freud is psychoanalysis, Pavlov is physiology, then it is psychology.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Psycho-soul, logos, science of the soul.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
That is, it is one of the directions of the science of the soul.

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
The program was proclaimed in 1913 by the American researcher John Watson,

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
who believed that it was necessary to study not consciousness, but behavior.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
That's where they are called behaviorists.

15:36.000 --> 15:45.000
They studied the reaction of a person, his reaction to some things happening from the outside.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
That is, to certain irritants, let's say, external.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Studying the direct connections of stimuli and reactions, reflexes,

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
behaviorism attracted the attention of psychologists to study the skills, skills and experience.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
He opposed psychoanalysis.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Behaviorism initiated various psychological and psychotherapeutic schools.

16:12.000 --> 16:19.000
By the way, today, not so fashionable as it was fashionable 10 years ago,

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
the so-called NLP, Neuro-linguistic programming.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
It is very controversial how useful it is, how not useful it is,

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
what this NLP actually affects when it affects a person.

16:38.000 --> 16:52.000
But the basis for NLP and behavioral therapy was behaviorism.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Freud, Pavlov and behaviorism.

16:56.000 --> 17:05.000
These are three bricks on which various tendencies, schools, theories arose and collapsed.

17:05.000 --> 17:13.000
It is interesting to note that the Americans had an ambiguous relationship with Sigmund Freud.

17:14.000 --> 17:22.000
For example, psychoanalysis was almost devoted to anathemas and was considered a false science.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
Although later they reduced the momentum a little and decided that it was not a false science,

17:30.000 --> 17:39.000
that psychoanalysis could be used, but in psychiatry and only by those who have a doctor's diploma, a medical diploma.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
People without such a diploma cannot do psychoanalysis in America.

17:44.000 --> 17:52.000
Such things happened in the middle of the last century.

17:52.000 --> 18:01.000
In our country, in the 30s, behaviorism was developing.

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
By the way, Bekhterev was one of those who considered and studied these issues.

18:10.000 --> 18:19.000
But, as in many scientific trends of those years, they were unpopular, harmful.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
It's almost like Weissman and Morgan in genetics, for which Vavilov suffered.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
The same was here.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
Such subtle things were considered wrong.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
They did not agree with the concept of the construction of communism and socialism.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
And as a science, it developed only abroad.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
Why are we going to consider Western theories and Western scientists?

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
Because since the 30s, it was forbidden to do this.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Literally, for fear of death.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
And there is only one hope that now, as the country develops,

19:11.000 --> 19:21.000
as experience accumulates, maybe some of you will contribute to the creation of new theories, new trends.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
Maybe some of you will be interested and will do this in your life.

19:27.000 --> 19:38.000
And I am sure that in 10-15 years we will have our own scientists, academics, our own works, theories, schools.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I would really like to hope for this.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
But for now, we will see everything that was created not by us, but before us.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
We will see what we can use and how we can use it, how useful it can be.

19:51.000 --> 19:59.000
And we will take something for granted and say, I know this, it's interesting, but in this case it is not applicable, because it has accelerated.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
Or it does not match the views that I adhere to.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
To management, to business, to motivation.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
The Bifurcat theory of motivation.

20:12.000 --> 20:22.000
The Bifurcats noted that the term motivation is too general and not scientific enough.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
To be honest, I agree with them somewhere.

20:24.000 --> 20:36.000
It is really very general and today there are so many different theories that it is more theoretical than scientific, although it can be scientific as well.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Experimental psychology, under this name, actually studies the needs.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
We will talk a lot about this.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Or the attraction of the drive.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
There is a theory of drives, that is, the theory of attraction.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
By the way, now this is a very fashionable word, drive.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Do you have a drive or do you not have a drive to work?

20:55.000 --> 21:07.000
Slang, which came to us quite recently, was used more than 80-70 years ago as one of the theories of motivation.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
Do you have a drive? That is, a movement, an attraction, to do something.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
I am motivated by work, some process.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I have a desire to drive.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Drive is like to lead, to manage.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I like to manage the process.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
And, of course, these attractions had a purely physiological nature.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Behaviorists explained behavior through the scheme of stimulus-reaction.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Again, let's remember Pavlov.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
This is their brick, on which they built their building.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Pavlov's dog.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Stimulus-reaction, unconditional and conditional.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
And considering the stimulus as an active source of reaction.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
Based on this, motivation began to be understood as a state.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
I am motivated, I have a state that makes me do something.

22:05.000 --> 22:19.000
Because the function of this state drives my body to move.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
That is, I am motivated to act, live, work, think actively.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
There is an external stimulator, of course, but it exists.

22:33.000 --> 22:41.000
For example, what is the most active stimulator for motivation, for drive?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Our boss came and said,

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
Sidorov, come to the desk and do what I told you in the morning.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Great drive, motivation, reaction.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
The boss said, under this reaction, I am quickly motivated,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I sit at the table like a bunny, I do everything.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Here is the stimulus-reaction.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Please, it doesn't work, it works, great.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The system is in action.

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
So, behaviorists considered motivation as a drive.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
As something that had a purely physiological nature.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Stimulus-reaction.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
What other theories arose?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
The theory of reinforcement of motives.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
The theory was new, but as we say, everything new is well forgotten old.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
If we remember that the theory of reinforcement of motives had a hedonic theory,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
and hedonism is an ethnic doctrine,

23:44.000 --> 23:52.000
originally developed in the ancient Greek Kyrenean school of the 4th century BC.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It's not even the last century.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
The goal of life and the highest good was to enjoy.

23:59.000 --> 24:09.000
When I was preparing for this lecture, I read it with pleasure and thought,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
how it corresponds to the spirit of our time.

24:13.000 --> 24:24.000
Many people now enjoy the good and believe that the goal of life is to achieve the good and enjoy.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
This is what they work for.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Motivation? Motivation.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Yes, this is their motivation.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Enjoyment is not a reward for the good, but the good itself.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
This was the opinion of the philosophers and Epicureans of ancient Greece.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And they are philosophers.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
It's interesting that enjoyment is not a reward, but a benefactor.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
It's a deep philosophical thought, but we won't dwell on it.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Although you can think about it on the board.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
The good is defined as something that brings enjoyment.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
If something brings me pleasure, it's good.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And if it's suffering, it's evil.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It's simple and logical.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
The Greeks formulated two principles, which are also very logical.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
The Greeks were wise in many things, including medicine.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
People strive to maximize pleasure.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
It works now.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
And people strive to minimize suffering.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It also works.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Why should I multiply my suffering when I can multiply my pleasure?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And live for pleasure.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
A great theory.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It works for many.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
It can be said to be the goal of life for a certain level.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
It can be said that it's bad or good.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
There are people who think it's good.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
They accept it and they are effective.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Because it's motivation for them.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
And for someone motivation is a completely different principle.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Absolutely different.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
Taking the principle of hedonism as a basis,

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
Thorndike proposed the law of effect.

26:22.000 --> 26:30.000
Behavioral reactions, which follow the perceived experience, are fixed.

26:31.000 --> 26:40.000
But if the reaction follows unpleasant experience, they disappear.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Is it logical? Yes.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Again, motivation is a reaction.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Motivation with a plus.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I will remember it.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
It's good.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
If I did this job well,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
and I did it like this, I will remember it.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And I was given a bonus for it.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I will remember it.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I will work like this.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
But if I did it like this,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
and I was told to fire me if I did it again,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I will not work like this.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Motivation and reaction.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
It works.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
There are many people and many options for different methods.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
It's perfect to have employees who are all like a selection.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
All from the same incubator.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And all listen to the same team.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
And they are motivated by something simple and ordinary.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
There are no such people.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Therefore, there are so many opinions and approaches.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
Therefore, management of human resources is not only science.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
It requires colossal endurance, calmness and good health.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
So, not only Thorndike was engaged in the theory of motif reinforcement.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Ihal was engaged in this theory.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Let's pay attention again.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
There is a father, a founder, a brick, and a large building grows on it.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Again, a brick and a building.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
And then a plaza and a huge pyramid.

28:04.000 --> 28:13.000
He, as a habit, understood the connection between the reaction and a specific stimulus,

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
which arose as a result of positive reinforcement or punishment.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
He didn't offer anything radically different from Thorndike.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
He just deepened and developed it.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
He changed his mind a little.

28:31.000 --> 28:39.000
In principle, the theory of motif reinforcement has several authors.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
They looked at the same thing from different points of view.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
This also has a right to life.

28:46.000 --> 28:55.000
Skinner demonstrated that behavior can be effectively changed by reinforcing the desirable and ignoring the undesirable.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
Let's manage people this way.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
We will actively highlight and praise those who are effective.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
And we will not react to those who do not work very well.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
We will not scold them.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
We will not offend them.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
We will not close the doors to their reactions.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
We will not let them do this.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
By the way, this is a really interesting approach.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
It can also be used today.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
We can actively reward, raise salaries, motivate with education,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
give vouchers for rest to all families,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
to the best employees,

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
so that others would be envious of this theory,

29:47.000 --> 29:58.000
but so that others would want to succeed next year.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
I agree with him that he left the punishment.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
Punishment can force, change behavior.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
Punishment never leads to efficiency.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
If we take the history of our country,

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
what has been talked about a lot in recent decades,

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
there were many films about the system of camps, the system of punishment.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
One of the theories is that we have become such a power

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
because we want to ask the question,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
if there were no camps,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
maybe we would have become even more powerful,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
even more interesting,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
and maybe we would not have had such shocks.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Maybe punishment is not necessary.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
An interesting point.

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
In this case, I like Skinner because he does not reject,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
he just lowers the punishment.

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
Maybe in management, for some it is not his style,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
and for some it is the style that a person was looking for,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
or the one that he uses in everyday work.

31:15.000 --> 31:25.000
There is a group of theorists,

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
let's say, theorists who are already closer to us in time,

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
who, using those bricks and foundations,

31:35.000 --> 31:43.000
began to develop more deep

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
and motivated theories.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
The most famous, the first brick in this pyramid,

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
is Abraham Maslow.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
He is followed by Alderfer, McLelland,

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
and he is written and pronounced differently,

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Herzberg,

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
but more often Herzberg,

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
if you see it written differently,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
you mean that it is the same person.

32:18.000 --> 32:24.000
Let's consider the theory of each of them.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
All of them are based on the theory of Abraham Maslow,

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
so we will dwell on his theory in detail.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
If you remember, a few slides ago I said

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
that even in Western companies,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
although this theory is more than 40 years old,

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
the most common knowledge is Maslow's theory,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
which is known by the management.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
In principle, this theory is really interesting,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
controversial, but in any case,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
it reflects in great detail

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
the various motivational principles

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
that exist in a person.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
Let's consider the motivational theory in detail.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
After that, I advise you to return to this slide

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
and look at everything highlighted in blue.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
What is the difference between them?

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Although they are all based on the same thing.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Maslow's theory, the main brick,

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
the main one for building a pyramid.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Everyone later relied on this theory,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
argued with it, agreed, disagreed,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
refined, developed.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Abraham Maslow divided the needs

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
into primary and secondary.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
There are five steps in total.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
There are more detailed maps,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
but if someone is interested,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
he can already see the original source.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
I do not advise reading any literature

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
on this topic,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
any analytical one.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
If you are interested,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
read only the primary sources.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
You are smart, educated, interested people.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Make your own conclusions,

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
analyze them yourself.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
First, it will be your personal experience,

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
which will be reflected in your practice.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
It is the individual, unique, exclusive.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
And no one will tell you better than the primary source

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
about the theory of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
like Maslow himself.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
So, in this case, in this lecture,

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
these are the strokes, this is the quintessence.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
If you want to dig deeper,

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
go to the primary source.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Read Freud, Maslow,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
read someone else who interested you.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
No, you will have enough knowledge

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
to understand where it comes from,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
what is taken,

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
and what can be used for yourself.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
That is, the main aspects,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
the strokes, the Rakhmetov method.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
We read only what we need,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
if you want to go to the primary source for your soul.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
So, Maslow.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Five steps.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
The first, the simplest.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Water, air, food.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
We can't live without it.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It's physiology.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
These are our physiological needs.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
The second step is safety.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
It is really very important

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
to have stable work.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
The third step is the need for social contacts,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
belonging to an organization.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
The fourth step is the need for recognition.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
Look, each step adds.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
It doesn't mean that if a person has a need for recognition,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
he doesn't need a physiological need.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
It's just that there is a need for recognition.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
And the third step is the need for social contacts.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
He doesn't need a physiological need for recognition.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's one of the other things.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
That's why it's a pyramid.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
And the last and the highest is the need for self-expression,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
for the disclosure of one's own abilities,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
in creativity, in various relationships, in growth,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
in everything.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Are all five steps inherent in everything?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Yes and no.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.000
It depends on how much we need it today.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
Imagine a person who is 20, 35 and 65 years old.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
What needs will they have?

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
I think that a person who is 25

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
will have all five needs.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
He will definitely need to disclose the need for self-expression.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
For someone who is 65,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
there will be enough safety needs.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
He has already achieved everything in life.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
He has seen everything.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
He has been in all roles,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
in all situations.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Now he is already old.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
We all have a physiological need.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
But he needs a stable pension,

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
medical care,

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
and safety needs for him.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
So that no one attacks him on the street.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
He will live his life in his country house,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
reading books,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
going to museums,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
meeting friends.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
He may not need social contacts.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
For someone, they will need to go to the theater,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
to the museum.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
For someone, they will need self-expression.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Such people continue to work.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
These are creative people,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
these are unchanging leaders.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
People work until the age of 80-90.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
If we take people of science, actors,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and many other specialties,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
it does not matter.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It can be a person of a working specialty,

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
who continues to work when he is over 70.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
He has needs that do not allow him to stop

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
and calmly go to rest.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
These needs

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
actually depend on the state

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
in which we see a person.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Either he becomes in a state of rest,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
or he is looking for something in life,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
because he is going further and further

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
on this ladder.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Let's start with the third stage.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
The first, physiological, and the second

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
are very simple and understandable.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
The third stage is social needs.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
For us, a person,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
in an organization,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
what does it mean?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
For the leaders,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
how can I provide my employees

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
with this need?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
How can I close it?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
How can I create a single team at work?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
How many trainings are there now,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
even out-of-town,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
on team building, on creating a team?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Here it is, the third need.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
Periodically hold a general meeting,

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
both a general and a managerial one.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Do not destroy informal groups without need.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Why?

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
We have not yet talked about informal groups.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
They exist in every organization,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
absolutely in every one.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Some have a plus sign,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
others have a minus sign.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
There are formal and informal leaders.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Often, informal leaders

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
can be stronger than formal leaders.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
How to influence and how to fight?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
In theory, this is a topic of a separate lecture.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
And it would be ideal to include

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
conflictology, psychology,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
psychotypes,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
managing conflicts

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
and stress resistance

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
in this topic.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
All together.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
Because it is a very serious and deep topic.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
In principle,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
the advice is this.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
If there are informal groups,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
it is not recommended to destroy them.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
This is a fact.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
But to try to control them,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
or at least keep your hand on the pulse,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
what happens?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
What kind of leader? How does he influence?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Maybe he has a very positive influence on everyone.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Or vice versa.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
What will be harmful for the organization?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Try to control without destroying.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Create conditions for the activity

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
of employees outside the organization.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Corporate holidays are very popular now.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
There are no companies

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
where corporate holidays

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
were not held at least in the New Year.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
In any. Absolutely.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
General outings,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
summer holidays,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
barbecues, sports events.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
For example,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
a coffee shop is very important.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
If you have a huge office

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and there is a coffee shop on the floors,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
where people can come to pour coffee,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
tea, water, talk,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
communicate,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
it is very important.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
By the way, I did not write,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
but a smoking room

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
is also a place where a person

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
satisfies social needs.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
This is a place where you can find out,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
as in a coffee shop,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
all the latest news,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
gossip,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and hear at meetings.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
An amazing place.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
In many companies it is now forbidden to smoke,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
so the center is in a coffee shop.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
If there were no coffee shops,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
it would probably be good to create them.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
The fourth step.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
The need for respect.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Indeed,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
when I respect a person,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I trust him.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
That is, by trusting, I can provide

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
a person with more substantive work,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
evaluate and encourage employees,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
show respect to them,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
provide some additional rights,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
impose some additional duties

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
on a person.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I trust, I respect a person,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I trust him

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
more authority.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
A lot of things

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
can be done

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
in your team,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
satisfying the need for respect.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Moreover, this need exists

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
in every person who works.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Any person,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
any person who works,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
wants to be respected,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
appreciated in the team.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
This is very important.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Any person

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
is pleased

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
to hear at least from time to time

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
that he or she likes

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
how you work.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Well done. This is very important.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Probably, without this,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
there is no real leadership

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
of people.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
People often react

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
to such comments

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
more emotionally,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
there is a surge of

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
more efficiency than the bonus.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Well, the bonus is a bonus.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Yes, I earned it, it's nice.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
But you work very well,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
keep up, I'm watching you.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Well done.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It is often expensive.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Very expensive,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
especially from the manager,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
and if it is in the presence of comrades,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
employees,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
it is very important.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
The last stage is self-expression.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It is not always achieved,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
not everyone needs it.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
For example, work that allows

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
to develop one's abilities,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
one's potential,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
or difficult work,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
work that allows to make decisions on one's own.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
In principle, this is already the leaders

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
of the highest link.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Work that allows them to make decisions on their own.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
By and large,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
it is like a disease,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
like a strong drug.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
In general, leadership is really a drug.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
The ability to solve difficult tasks

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
is often fast.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Once we counted with colleagues

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
with managers of the highest link

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
how much time they often spend

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
on making difficult decisions.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
These are top managers.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Managers who have the right

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
to solve strategic issues,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
issues of the budget,

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
which can be changed

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
by a simple move of the story

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
in this company.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Often on very serious things.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
After some work,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
how much time do they spend?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Many said,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
sometimes half a minute,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
sometimes one and a half.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
That is, a second.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Literally once,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I take responsibility.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Yes, I made a decision.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
This is a drug,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
but it is very important

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
for people of this kind.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Creative work, of course,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
is also a certain drug,

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
natural self-expression

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
and getting new knowledge

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
and information.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Let's go back to the IT sector.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Getting new knowledge and information

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
is not only self-expression for them,

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
it is a necessary need.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Otherwise, they simply

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
do not have the right

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
to do it.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
They are late for the market.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
That is, what will be fashionable

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
in three years,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
they must know now

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
and understand how it can be applied.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
If they find out exactly in three years,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
they will be late for three years

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
in the competition.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Maslow, bricks.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
All the rest are built

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
on this brick.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Alderfer.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
He reworked the hierarchy of needs a little.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Remember, right?

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Freud, Jung and others

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
reworked his theory.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Pavlov, behaviorists,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
reworked,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
added to his theory.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
The same here.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Brick, pyramid, brick, pyramid.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
What did he change?

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
He proposed

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
to highlight three main groups

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
of needs.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
What are these groups?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
In general, this theory

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
is called

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
abbreviated ERG.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
English abbreviation.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
In Russian,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
the first is existence.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
That is, existence.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
The second is relatedness.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
That is, it is a belonging.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I translate it simply from English,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
because in the text you see

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
a little, let's say, more scientific

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
translation.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
And the needs of growth.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Growth is just development.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
So,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
existential needs.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
That is,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
existing needs.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
This is the satisfaction of basic needs.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
What are our basic needs?

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Remember, the first and second steps.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
The first and second.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Physiology, air, water, food and safety.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Polyclinic,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
stable salary, pension.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Safety.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
The second is social.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Belonging.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
And the fourth step.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
The third is belonging, the fourth is social.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
We establish and support

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
significant contacts, connections,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
interaction with other people.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
These two steps

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
are combined into one.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
So, the first and the second

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
are existential needs.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
The third and the fourth are social needs.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
And the fifth

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
are the needs of growth.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
The self-expression.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Here is self-improvement,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
personal growth,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
needs of self-respect.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
What did

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Alderfer do

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
new?

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
He simplified the oil theory.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
If we remember this theory,

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
there are not five steps,

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
but only three.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
From the point of view of mathematics,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
it is easier to remember three

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
than five.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
From the point of view of

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
the content,

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
it is the same.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
The next one.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
The theory of Maclean.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
The leading role of consciousness

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
in determining human behavior.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
How interesting!

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Here something sounds

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
from what we have already considered.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Conscious, unconscious.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Here is the leading role of consciousness.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
A person has three

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
basic important needs.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
What are they?

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Here, with the oil,

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
he does not interfere.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
This is something separate.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
In that slide,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
there are four theories.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Comments under his theory.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
In comparison with the oil theory,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
you will not find a blue highlight.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Because he really has a difference.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
What are the three

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
important needs?

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Power, success,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
and involvement.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Involvement, by the way,

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
is correlated

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
with the needs of the oil.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Power.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
The desire to influence other people.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Respect for self-expression in the oil.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
A little differently,

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Maclean's theory sounds.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Maybe even more rigidly,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
more principled,

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
more accentuated.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
What kind of people

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
have such needs?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
They are good orators.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
They demand high attention

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
from other people.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Leaders.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Leaders are energetic people.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
They attract people.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
They lead people.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Success.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Bringing work to

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
a successful completion.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
People focused on the result.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Look how everything is interconnected.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
We had corporate cultures.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
The culture of power.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
The culture of achievements.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
The task, the result.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And here it is interconnected.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
You can't consider

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
motivation separately,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
the person in the company culture separately.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Everything is together.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Everything is interconnected.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Power, success, corporate culture

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
that chooses people

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
who have needs in power,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
in management,

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
in success, and involvement.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
These are people

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
who identify themselves

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
with the company.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
They are involved in what happens

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
in the company, what is done there.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
They build relationships.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
They provide help.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
They are ideal in communication.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
These are people

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
who are

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
communicative,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
sociable.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Everyone is absolutely interesting to them.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
These are the three

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
interesting needs

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
that were highlighted by McLeod.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
They are worth considering.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
And the theory of two factors.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It is

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
the theory of Herzberg.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
The theory was created

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
based on interviews

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
taken at various workplaces

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
in different professional groups

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
and in different countries.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
The interviewers were asked to describe

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
the situation in which they felt

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
complete satisfaction and, on the contrary,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
dissatisfaction with their work.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I can imagine

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
how difficult the surveys were,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
how difficult it was to bring them together

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
and to draw some results.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
But he did it successfully

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
and drew the theory of two factors.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
The answers were classified

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
into two groups.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Studying the collected material,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Herzberg came to the conclusion

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
that satisfaction and dissatisfaction

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
with work are caused by

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
various factors.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
The motivating factors are motivators.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
The satisfaction factor is career growth.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Responsibility factor is

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
positive assessment of achievements.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
The content of work is

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
the main motivator.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
The factors of labor conditions

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
are hygienic factors.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
The dissatisfaction factor is

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
the amount of salary

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
compared to competitors.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I don't like it

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
because I know that

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
competitors pay more

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
for the same work I do.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Indeed,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
everyone is watching each other.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
We should pay attention to the market.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
There is no secret in the market.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Although everyone is very careful

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
about their salaries,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
we have a very good information leak.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Benefits, social status,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
guarantees

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
and influence on personal life.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
This has become very popular

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
in recent years.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
It is called

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
life and work balance.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Many companies

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
take this balance

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
as a value

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
in their values,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
in their guidelines.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
They guarantee

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
their employees

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
this unique balance.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
They say that

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
they don't need to work

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
until death.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
They say that

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
they don't need to work

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
until death.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
They say that

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
they don't need to work

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
until death.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
They say that

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
they need to sleep,

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
go to a visit,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
spend time with friends.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
They say that

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
it is not right

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
to work in a duodara.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It is not effective.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
This is where

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
life and work balance

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
comes from.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It is from two-factor theory.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
In order to effectively motivate

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
your subordinates,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
the boss should understand

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
the essence of the problem.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
The essence of the problem is the process.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
If the theory we have just discussed,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
the four,

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
the main subject of the video,

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
were called substantive,

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
the next theory we will discuss

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
is the process theory of motivation.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
There are the substantive,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
the process theory of motivation,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
the main subject of the video,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
the process theory of motivation,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
the main subject of the video,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
and the next theory of motivation.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
The process theory of motivation

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
is based on the fact

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
that a person

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
puts in his work

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
a certain amount of effort

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
that depends not only

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
on his needs but also

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
on certain aspects of the working situation.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
A person distributes

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
the work to his subordinates.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
There are three main process theories of motivation.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
What are they?

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
The theory of expectation,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
the presence of an active need

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
is not the only and necessary condition,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
the presence of a need

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
is not the necessary condition

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
of motivation,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
the theory of justice,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
and the model of Porter-Lowler.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
We'll discuss them later.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
The theory of expectation.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
The point is

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
why a person chooses

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
a certain line of behavior.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
The theory of expectation

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
is based on the fact

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
that

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
active needs

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
are not

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
a necessary condition

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
for motivation

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
of a person to work.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I wonder

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
what are the keys

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
to this theory?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
The key to this theory is

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
the result,

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
validity and expectation.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
What is the result?

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
What are the interesting and strange keys?

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
What is the result?

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
It is anything related to the need

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
of behavior in the workplace.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
What can be?

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
For example,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I am stressed,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
which I got at work.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Salary, yes.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Respect from colleagues,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
is it related to the need

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
and consequence

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
of behavior at work?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Validity is related to it.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Subjective satisfaction

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
with the result.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Subjective.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
And expectation.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Expectation of successful performance

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
with the application

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
of the appropriate efforts.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I make an effort

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
and I expect

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
a reward.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
These are my efforts

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
and my expectations for a reward.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Employees form expectations

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
related to the results

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
of their behavior using the preliminary experience.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
For example,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
they decide how likely

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
to make something meaningful for them.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Let's take a salesman as an example.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
A successful salesman

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
thinks

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
that if he makes

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
more than 9 deals

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
per week,

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
and his percentage depends

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
on the quantity

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
and volume of the produced product,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
he will get

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
a higher reward.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
It is highly likely

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
that he will make a few more calls

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
to potential buyers.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
It is a great motivation.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
But when a salesman thinks

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
that the product is well used

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
and that additional sales

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
will not change the result,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
that there will be no reward,

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
that he can leave work

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
in the afternoon

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
for additional efforts,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and so on,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
will he make

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
additional efforts?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
If a person is 100% sure

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
that his additional efforts

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
will lead to additional expectations,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
that is,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
they are realized,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
that he made an effort

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
and his expectations were met,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
then he will do it.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
He will satisfy his needs

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
and he will work effectively.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
If he is not sure of this,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
he will not work effectively.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
The theory of justice

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
is a very important one.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
The theory of justice

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
is the main postulate of this theory.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Employees evaluate

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
their relationships

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
by comparison.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
The theory of justice

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
is one of the most effective theories.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
We always look into the pocket of our neighbor.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Always.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
And rarely

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
we compare something else

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
except for the salary.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I am in marketing, he is in marketing.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
We do the same thing.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
He thinks it can be different.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
He thinks he does better, more,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
more qualified.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I have my own subjective approach.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
The theory of justice.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Since we are in the same position,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
we are called Aditakov,

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
marketing manager,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
we must get the same salary.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
To be fair.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
If I do not see justice,

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I am not satisfied,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
then, of course,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
I strive to restore this justice.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I will hire my boss,

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
raise my salary.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
What should I do to get a raise?

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
But Sidor in another department

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
gets other money.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
There are two options.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Either I will be fired or I will get a raise.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Until people

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
start to think

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
they get a fair reward,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
they will strive to reduce

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
the intensity of work.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
While I go to my boss

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
and beg for a raise,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
my efficiency is close to zero.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I am effectively busy

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
with the theory of justice

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
towards myself, my beloved.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
But not towards

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
the efficiency of my work.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
By the way,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
the salary review

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
is held twice a year

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
in large companies.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
They compare themselves

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
with IT specialists

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
in the market, banks, banks, etc.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Now there are more and more

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
professional companies

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
that make such reviews.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Hey Group,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
which offers these reviews,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and Watson White,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
a global supplier of salary reviews,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
have been launched.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The Russian market

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
is getting more and more

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
industry-focused.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
They hold this review twice a year

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and it is very useful for employers.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Because you can always say to your employee,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
my dear,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I have a good argument

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
that I pay you more than the market.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
You will have good arguments.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
The other question is

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
whether he will calm down

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
after this review.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It all depends on the person.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But it is always good

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
to have such an argument on the table.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The model of Porter-Lowry

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
contains features

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
of both the theory of expectation

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
and the theory of justice.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
As usual,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
the picture is the same,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
just a little different.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But the same basic premise.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And they argue with it,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
improve, finish.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
The same here.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So, what have they changed

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
in these two theories

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and what have they come to?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So, Lyman Porter

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
and Edward Lowler

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
have been launched

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
in the same year.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And Edward Lowler

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
has developed a complex

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
process theory of motivation,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
including elements

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
of the theory of expectation

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and the theory of justice.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
What are the five variables

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
they have laid down as a basis?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
These are the efforts spent,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
the perception,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
the results obtained,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
the reward itself

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
for all this above,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
and, of course,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
the degree of satisfaction.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I spent my efforts,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I had the perception

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
that I am so effective,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
so irreplaceable,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I have phenomenal results,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
well, in principle,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
the reward suits me,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
but suddenly I find out

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
that Vasya Vasichkin

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
from the neighboring department

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
received a bonus of $100 more

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
than me.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
To some extent,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
my satisfaction will be zero

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and all my efforts

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
from the previous four points

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
will be reduced to zero

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
because the theory of justice

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
will just rumble in me,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and the theory of expectations

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
will melt like smoke.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
The results achieved

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
depend on the efforts,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
abilities,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
characteristic features

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
and awareness of their role.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
The degree of confidence

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
is also important.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
The degree of confidence

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
is that this level of effort

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
will really bring

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
a certain level of reward.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Where can there be

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
misunderstandings,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
misunderstandings?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
These are really

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
the efforts spent

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and the results obtained.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
It seems to me

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
that the level of confidence

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
is not what I expected.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But my boss thinks

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
otherwise.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Therefore, my reward

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
is not what I expected.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And in this theory,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
of course,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
a certain ratio

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
is established

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
between the reward

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
and the results.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And this ratio

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
is very important

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
to calculate correctly.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
To position it correctly

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and to convey it

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
to the employee correctly.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
If you want to get

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
this reward,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
describe clearly

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
what it should do and how.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And at each stage

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
what result do you expect from it?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Then he will consider

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that he got it

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
fairly or unfairly

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
not received it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Because, as a rule,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
when a person has received

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and there are no questions

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
according to his expectations,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
it will be easier for you

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
to explain to your employee

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
that the theory of his expectations

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and your theory of fairness

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
are just

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
in full correlation

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
with each other.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And there should be a complete

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
mutual understanding that

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
if he made more efforts

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
in these and in these places,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
then his expectations in terms of reward

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
would be justified to a greater extent.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Let's continue our conversation

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
about the model of Porter-Lowler.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
They explained the mechanism of motivation

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
as follows.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The results achieved by the employee

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
depend on

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
three variables.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
1. The efforts spent.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
2. Abilities.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
3. Characteristics of a person.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And here, in the subsection,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
consciousness plays

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
its role

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
in a certain process.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
In this process of achieving results.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So, the efforts, abilities

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and characteristics of a person

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
are spent.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Speaking from the employee's

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
own perspective,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
the employee always takes into account

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
the efforts spent.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And what does the manager take into account

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
when comparing employees?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Is it only the efforts spent?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
No. Abilities.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
One is more capable than the other.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Or one has one ability,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
the other has another.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Someone is very motorized,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
and starts the project easily.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But in order to continue

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
the project to the end,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
to do routine work,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
for example,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
you need people with different abilities

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and characteristics.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
For example, if you have cholera at the beginning,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
then you have bloodsuckers and melancholy.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Therefore, the characteristics of a person

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
play a very important role

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
when achieving results.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Some people are more successful

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
and achieve more results,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
others are less successful

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
and achieve fewer results.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Is it because

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
those who achieve fewer results

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
are not in their place,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
do not do their job,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and in general,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
should we ask the question

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
that maybe we should change them

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
to more successful ones?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
The question is complex.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Maybe. Or maybe not.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Because not all people can be equally successful.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
And not every person

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
can be equally successful

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
from year to year.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
There are always ups and downs

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
for every person.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And another

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
very interesting point

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that should be noted

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
is that the level of effort

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
in turn depends

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
on the value of the reward

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and on how much

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
a person believes

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
in this connection

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
between his expenses and efforts

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
and the possibility of receiving

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
this reward.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
A very important remark

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
is the value of the reward.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
If a person is not interested

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
in his $100 bonus

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
because it is not money for him,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
he will not

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
spend

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
the maximum of his efforts

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
very effectively.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
If $100 bonus is a matter

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
of life and death,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
the result will be completely different.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
If the value of the reward

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
is not money,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and, for example,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
if a person does it,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
he will have a career growth

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
up the ladder.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And for him this value

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
will be extremely effective.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
If he does not have such a goal,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
he does not want to make a career.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I met many such people

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
because they are interested

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
in developing at a professional level.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
By the way, salaries also move

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
in two directions.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Here we have a career vector

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
and a vector of professionalism.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
If before the higher the manager

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
in the position, the more salary,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
now colossal salaries

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
are required to become a professional.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
To do this, you do not need to occupy

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
a high position in management,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
it is enough to be a professional

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
in your field, a guru,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
to receive often more

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
than a top manager.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
That is, the value of the reward,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
if a career prospect opens up for me

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and I am interested in it,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I will work.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
If not, then no.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And it is very important

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
to determine

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
what other achievements

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
require a level of result

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
can attract

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
internal rewards.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
What else is important for a person?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
We have already talked about the award.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Praise.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Promotion in service.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That is, if I am awarded

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
with all the company,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I think that

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
such a goal is worthy

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
of my efforts.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Here is such a model

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
combining the theory of expectation

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
with the theory of justice.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
It was created, by the way,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
very interesting.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Again, applicable.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
How many people,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
how many theories,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
how many theories,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
how many different adherents

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
of this approach.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Each model is interesting,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
applicable in practice.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I think that

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
some of the listed things

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
that we have studied today,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
that you will take into account,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
you have already used,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
you will use.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
In any case,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
these are existing models,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
they work and are applied

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
in practice in companies.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
In conclusion,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
we will talk a little,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
we will summarize

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
and talk about

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
what we have studied today

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and how we can use it.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
The first,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
probably, are the questions

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
that the head of any link

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
should ask himself

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
on motivation.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
After listening, analyzing

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
all the material,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
think and ask yourself,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
what do my subordinates need?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
There are two directions.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
The first one.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
What do my subordinates need?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And the list.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
What do they need?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
For example, more attention

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
from the head, that is, from me.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
More attention to details,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
to some informal groups.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That is, to determine

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
what exactly is interesting for them.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Probably, to use

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
an annual interview for this.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Or just to talk to people,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
to organize a meeting,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
to discuss.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
The second step,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
which prompts this question,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
the second option is

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
do I know what they need at all?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Maybe you know

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and will quickly write a list.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Or have you not thought about it at all?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Should they need something?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
They are paid so much,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
everything is fine.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Think about it.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
In what world

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
do the needs satisfy

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
during the activity

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
aimed at achieving the goal of the organization?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
That is, your organization has some goals

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
and there are people.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And how much

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
these goals and needs of people

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
who work in the organization

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
for these goals are satisfied?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
That is, if people are satisfied,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
it is clear that the organization

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
will achieve these goals.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Another question.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
If the satisfaction of work

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and productivity

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
of employees has increased,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
why did it happen?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's a good question.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Indeed.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And if they have not grown,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
why did it happen?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
When they have grown,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
they usually ask

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
why?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
They never ask so strictly.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Why are you so effective?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Interestingly,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
in my practice,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Western managers

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
asked managers

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
why they had such

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
large sales this year,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
even with a voice complaint.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
The managers were shocked.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
They said,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
they sell so much more

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
than planned.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
A very reasonable answer.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
You had the wrong budget.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
You lowered the budget.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
The budget should be different.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
If the budget was not 100,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
but 120,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and the implementation is 125,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
then the bonus would be

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
only 5%

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
for the re-implementation of the budget

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
of 120.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Otherwise, it turns out 25,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
because the budget was 100.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Everything is interconnected.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
The effective work can

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
make the management happy.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Sometimes it will make you happy

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
when the organization is formed,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
and sometimes it won't.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It means that

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
something was planned wrong.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
When you ask questions,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
other questions arise.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
How to measure

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
the results of the work?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Can it be measured?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
How can it be measured?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
If it is possible to measure

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and how often should it be evaluated?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
How much did we achieve

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
our goals?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
If we have not advanced enough,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
we know why

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and what to do

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to not fail

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
in business next year

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and not be out of the market.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Do not leave it.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Do not lose your share

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
in the market, your interest, your margin.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
These questions are very correct.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And it is true that

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
the result of the work is

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
not only the financial result.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Remember, we talked about

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
the depth of the hierarchy,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
the depth of the structure.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Then the question of the organizational

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
health index arises.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
The health index

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
and the survey of the

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
health index

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
are the main

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
questions.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
The health index

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
and surveys

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
help us

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
measure the result

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
of the work,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
the motivation of the staff,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
the assessment of the work

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
of people.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
All these things,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
surveys, reviews,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
surveys, give us the opportunity

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
to see the picture

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
of all our

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
victories and defeats

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
very clearly.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
They give us a good opportunity

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
to analyze

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
what we need to do,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
how to act correctly,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
or at least

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
where to look for

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
answers to these

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
very difficult questions.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
These questions

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
often depend on

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
whether

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
companies will stay in the market.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The next group

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
is not about questions,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
but about advice.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Although,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
we can also give you some information

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
to think about.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Some advice on

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
meeting the social needs of the staff.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Now we will repeat

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
what we have learned.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Remember, social needs

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
are the third and the fourth

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
group of steps

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
in the pyramid of oils.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
In order to satisfy

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
these needs of the staff,

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
what should you do

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
as a manager?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Give the employees

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
a job

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that would help

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
them communicate.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
If you see that you have

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
employees who have

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
a strong need,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
it is important for them

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
as air,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
communication is air,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
try to find

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
an application for them.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Maybe they will

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
work in a corporate newspaper,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
maybe they will work in corporate

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
departures,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
maybe they will

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
work in a company

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
that is not necessarily

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
their job,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
but it will give them

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
an opportunity to express themselves.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Create a team spirit.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
We have already talked about

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
the importance of

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
a team spirit.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Of course, hold

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
meetings with your employees.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
It is very important

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
to inform your employees

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
about what is going on in the company.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Why is it important?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
First, it gives you an opportunity

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
to understand the feedback

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
of your employees

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
in addition to satisfying

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
the social needs of the staff.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
What worries them?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
What bothers them?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Stop rumors.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
It is also a very interesting topic.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Rumors in the organization are sometimes

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
created on purpose, sometimes they are cultivated.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
It is a completely different topic.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
But they also need to be controlled.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Even if you create them for some reason,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
they also need to be controlled,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
you also need to keep your hand on the pulse.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
These meetings will help

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
to manage these things.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Do not try to destroy

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
the existing informal groups.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
If, of course, they do not

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
bring some negative component

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
to the organization,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
or do not cause damage,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
it is not worth it.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
On the contrary,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
take the most out of this benefit.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And, of course,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
create some conditions

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
for the members of your organization

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
outside of its framework.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Corporate parties, for example.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
A great option.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Satisfaction of the need

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
for respect for the staff.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
How can this be done?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Offer subordinate more substantive work.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
For example,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
without adding a deposit,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
without changing your position,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
just say, seeing that a person has

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
such a huge rush,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
say, listen, help is needed.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Help in this direction,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
in this project.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Can you help?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Your knowledge is irreplaceable.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
This level is very necessary.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
A person will be happy.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
If a person has this need,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
he will be happy.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
He will be satisfied and will not

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
require a reward,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
because the reward for him,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
the respect and trust he has

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
is already a reward.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Provide your employees

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
a positive feedback

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
on the results.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Remember, we talked about

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
the fact that there is a knot,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
and that it is better to refuse punishment.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Right. It is better to encourage.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I encouraged these people,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I also wanted others to be encouraged.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
They will try.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
What are they worse at?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
They also want to be good.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Attract your employees

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
to the development of decisions.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Trust, again, trust and respect.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Consult,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
learn their opinion.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Often they can suggest

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
absolutely ideal options

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
to get out of difficult situations.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Often they seem to be dead ends.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Our people are very smart, talented, creative.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
When you ask them,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
they say, why are you silent?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And no one asked.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Ideas are amazing.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And, of course,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
the property of delegating

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
subordinates of additional rights

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
and powers comes from this.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Of course, they will ask you.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
If I trust you,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I will ask you.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
You will answer me.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Not me to cover you,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
but you will answer for me.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Not for me, but for yourself.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
As a manager,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
a person is responsible for all the mistakes of the department.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And the manager who says

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
that I am not Sidorov is a fool.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
A normal manager will never say that.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
He will say, I am to blame.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Yes, because you are the manager,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
you are paid salary.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
As a manager, you are obliged

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
to take all the risks.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
But delegating

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
is clear that

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
if something goes wrong,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
the manager will be punished

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
for the project lost.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Even for delegating.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
But this blow

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
should also be able to keep.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
This is professionalism.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And also an important point.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
If there is an opportunity

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
to promote subordinates on the career ladder.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Again, the hierarchy in the company

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
22 steps, 6 steps.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
More can be promoted,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
less can be promoted.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
But you can promote inside the steps.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Remember, we just talked about

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
that there is a career ladder

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
upstairs and professional.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
The professional can be

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
younger, older, leading, guru.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Let's say,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
several steps on this flat line

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
we drew.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
There is such an opportunity

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
promotion.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
It's a ladder,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
but a career ladder.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And salary also depends on it.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And education.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It's a great motivator.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
People improve their level,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
competence, qualification

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
and communicate.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
By the way, education can be attributed

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
to the satisfaction of socialization.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
During the training,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
if people from different departments are mixed,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
they often get to know each other

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
because they have never had to meet.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
The needs in self-expression of the staff.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
How to satisfy them?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Provide subordinates

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
with the opportunity to learn and develop.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Look, the learning and development

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
goes through all the needs.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
We respect you,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
trust you,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
we believe that you are loyal,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
that you will not leave us,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
we invest money in you,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
we count on you.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Socialization.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You can talk to people,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
compare yourself with others.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Self-expression.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
During the training,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
you can show yourself,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
you will be noticed,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
maybe we will look at you with different eyes.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
From different sides,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
education is a very motivating factor.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
The main thing is to use it correctly.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And the results of the training.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
To give subordinates a difficult job,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
requiring them to give their all.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
This is the highest trust.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And of course,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
people have a colossal self-expression.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Because something new

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
is absolutely for them,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
it mobilizes.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And they are more effective.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Not only what they did routinely,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
but this is what captures them,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
attracts.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Again, those who are motivated by it.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And to start developing

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
creative abilities in every possible way.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
If the company has the opportunity,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
to direct these people

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
to some different projects.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Well,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
that's all for today.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Dear colleagues,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I hope that your time

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
was not wasted in vain.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
In any case,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I really hope that all the material

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
that we discussed today

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
will be useful for you.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And that the lecture was interesting.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
It seems to me that

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I will not make any special recommendations

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
on reading books,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
literature on this topic.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Because, again,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I repeat,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
read the primary sources.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It is very interesting.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Actually,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
it will be your communication with the author.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
If we remember Munchausen,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
remember when he said

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
that he communicates directly with Shakespeare.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Please communicate directly

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
if you are interested in Freud,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Maslow,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
with other theorists.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Because, probably,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
this will be the most correct communication

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
not through the prism

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
of someone else's perception.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
It will be only you

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and only the person

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
who was the founder of the theory.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And, of course,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
read the primary sources.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Because all the others

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
have worked on it,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
but in any case,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
the basis was laid

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
by some specific theorist.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Start working

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
on it if it is interesting for you.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And, in principle,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
all the knowledge that you have received today

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
will be more than enough

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
for you as a manager

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
to first of all

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
look at yourself,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
at what kind of person you are,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
what company you work in,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
what style of management you have,

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
how you work with your subordinates,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
whether you can motivate them,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
whether you can listen to them,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
how you recruited your staff,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
how you plan

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
your employees' career growth.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
All those aspects

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
that are very important

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
for your subordinates,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
for your employees,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
and for you in relation to your management

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
will be the necessary factors for your life.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Thank you very much for your attention.
