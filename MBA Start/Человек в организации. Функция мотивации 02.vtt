00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Everything we have discussed before is directly related to motivation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What is motivation? Let's look at it again.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In order to make all the tasks set before the organization or before a person

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
during the annual interview or in the planned trial period

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
were achieved, it is not enough to have only a set of qualified personnel.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Really? Why?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Because it is necessary to organize the work in such a way

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that everyone puts the maximum effort to perform the tasks set.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And this is already difficult.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And this is really management.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And how to organize the work of people so that they put the maximum effort,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
not to sit at work from one call to another.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This is already management art.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
By the way, in management courses,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
they read a lot of different subjects.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Marketing, economics, finance.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
All this is very important, all this is necessary.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Without it, it is impossible.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Maybe because I am a director of personnel,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
so it seems to me that the most important aspect of management is human resources.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But maybe not only because of this.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Everything that happens is done by human hands and brains.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If we cannot manage people, we will not be able to manage the economy.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
People make it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We will not be able to manage marketing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What is marketing?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If you buy some product, this product should be delivered by a person.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If you do not know how to manage these people, who will deliver the information?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Therefore, management of human resources,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
motivation of these resources is the most important aspect of management.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Successful and unsuccessful managers are those who know how to manage the staff.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So, let's move on to the motivation function.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The eternal topic, the infinite.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We start this infinite topic, the insanely interesting topic.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What is it interesting about?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
About the fact that any person wants to feel motivated when he goes to work.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
He wants to do what he likes.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And to do so and to receive money for it,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so that he receives pleasure and satisfaction not only from work, but also from the reward.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the company is interesting because it wants to have motivated employees,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
who will work more and more effectively.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
How to achieve this?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Almost like a fairy tale, almost an unfulfilled dream.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
But in some companies it comes true, some companies strive for it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
One of the problems in today's market,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
which organizations face in the field of stimulating employees,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is that two generally known principles are used.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Increase in salary or fired.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If you don't like it, you can quit.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We pay like this.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Someone works well, he was paid more.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That's it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
There are no other stimuli.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
In principle, you can say, well, what is right?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A person works for money.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
For the idea, of course, we are interested in a lot of different components when we get to work,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
which we will talk about a little later.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But salary is an important factor.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Although, as many studies show,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
salary is not the main criterion of evaluation when a person changes his job.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Look how interesting.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We often choose a job because we leave one and go to another, where they pay more.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
On the other hand, when we leave a job,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the argument that I am leaving where I am paid more is not always the main one.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Even today in large Western companies,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
managers are best known for some motivation theories.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Because motivation is a serious, important argument in any company.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And, of course, to know about various theories, approaches, trends,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
what were, what are now,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and, in principle, you can even read what will be fashionable and what will be accepted on the market after a while.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Any manager or person who considers his career growth as managerial,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that is, a soldier who does not want to be a general,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
so any general should know the basics of managing and managing people.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And the most important component is motivation.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Naturally, high efficiency and adequate stimulation of employees is an important function of management.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And it absolutely cannot be ignored.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It cannot be made very simple and it cannot be complicated,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but it is necessary to have an idea of ​​art of motivation.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And now let's talk about this art.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Question. Why do you work?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Is the question asked correctly?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Or better to ask why do you work in this position?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
From your point of view, which question is more correct?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
If we can answer the first question right away, why do you work?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The answer is, I work for money.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Then the second question, I work for money in this position,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
is unlikely to be answered by a person right away,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because he will think about it, why I really work in this position.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Think about it, why do you work in the position you are in now?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Why?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Well, money is clear, not free.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And why else?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Let's try to answer these questions.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
What motivates you to work in this or that position?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Behavior at work can be controlled by external and internal factors.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The external factor is the stimulus-reaction,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
the internal factor is the behavior of a person at work,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and it is controlled by the influence on the inner world of a person, on his needs.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000
That is, I work in this position because my needs are being fulfilled,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I achieve something, I get satisfaction.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
That is, a certain motivation.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Speaking of motivation and the theory of motivation,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
let's start with the last century.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Capitalism was developing, it was 200 years old,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
100 years have passed, it was developing,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and people began to think about why some companies are more successful,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
others are less successful.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
What makes people work more effectively,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and how many wolves do not feed, but look into the forest.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
How to influence people to work?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Naturally, people began to be interested in these issues.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The very first thing that comes to mind is psychology.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
At the turn of the centuries,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
such an interesting science as psychoanalysis appeared.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Psychoanalysis was created at the end of the last century

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
by the Austrian scientist Sigmund Freud.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I think almost everyone knows Freud.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The personality is odious, the theory is known,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
although probably more known as the theory of sleep, the theory of sex.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And few people now even associate it with the theory of psychoanalysis

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
from the point of view of even some motivational things.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Psychoanalysis also arose not from nothing.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The basis for this is psychology,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
where psycho is the soul, and logos, as we know, is science.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
This is a science about the patterns of the development and functioning of the psyche.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Do not confuse it with psychiatry, which deals with the violation of the functioning of the psyche.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
By the way, there are really confused people here.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And psychoanalysis is also not psychiatry.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Freud's successors are the famous Jung,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
as well as Alfred Alder, and some others.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
In fact, it is probably better to be a successor than to create a direction.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Because, as a rule, the successor always argues with the founder's father.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Therefore, all his successors argued with Freud.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And the successors, based on his psychoanalysis, created their own theories, their own approaches,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
argued with Freud's postulates.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
But it is Freud who is the father of psychoanalysis.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And, in fact, the theory of human behavior is the first and one of the most influential theories of personality in psychology.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
The theory of personality.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And usually it refers to the classical psychoanalysis created by Sigmund Freud.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
By the way, many people forget about this.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That it was really a theory of personality in psychology, and this is a classical psychoanalysis.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The structure of the human psyche is distinguished by two spheres, the conscious and the unconscious.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
The unconscious is the biological nature of a person and is governed by instincts.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The instinct of self-preservation, for example, which regulates the sensory sphere of natural needs.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I want to eat, I will go and eat.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Here the fire is dangerous, I will not go there.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The instinct of self-preservation.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And the conscious, which controls the unconscious and determines behavior in the public sphere, in the public environment.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
There is a conflict between the conscious and the unconscious.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Then the balance between the two spheres of the psyche collapses.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Here psychoanalysis helps to understand the problem of this conflict.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The psyche is automatically regulated by the principle of satisfaction, which is modified in the principle of reality.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And with various violations, a reset is carried out through the unconscious sphere.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000
When some negative information accumulates and I cannot perceive it, I just reset it, I do not refuse it.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It is not there.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Later Freud worked out his views.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
He conducted a lot of experiments.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I will not talk about it now, we will not dwell on it.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But his ego and super ego are really very well known.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
The self and the super self.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000
The self is a part of a person's personality, which is in contact with the outside world.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
The self and the super self are very interesting qualities.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
This is what a person should do in society.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This is morality, this is honor, this is shame.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This is super ego.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Freud distributed such interesting things at different levels.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
That is, I am the world and my morality, shame, honor, conscience.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Probably, conscience will be the key word in the super ego.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
The super ego is my conscience.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
My conscience, through this prism, I look at the world around me.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
In this case, why do we dwell on Freud?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Because he is the father of psychoanalysis.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Many theories of motivation will use him as a basis.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Naturally, after rethinking, changing, improving, maybe even before recognition.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But he is the first brick on which a huge building called the theory of motivation is built.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
At the same time, they lived at the same time.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, Edith von Freud.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
One in Russia, the other in Europe.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, he developed, in general, he is a famous physiologist.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
By the way, he became the first Russian Nobel laureate in 1903.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
He studied the science of higher neural activity.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I think the first thing that comes to mind when any of us hears the surname Pavlov,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
is the experience with dogs, these are conditional and unconditional reflections.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Again, conscious, unconscious, conditional, unconditional.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Everything is very interconnected.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
As at the beginning of the last century, science developed in different countries in approximately the same direction.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Pavlov, the creation of the theory of conditional and unconditional reflections,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
was another brick on which the Americans built their theories.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And they called themselves, of course, not they, later they were defined as behaviorists.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
From the English word behave.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
That is, those who studied behavior, conditional and unconditional reflections of behavior.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So, behaviorism, behavior, one of the directions in psychology.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
If Freud is psychoanalysis, Pavlov is physiology, then it is psychology.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Psycho-soul, logos, science of the soul.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
That is, it is one of the directions of the science of the soul.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The program was proclaimed in 1913 by the American researcher John Watson,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
who believed that it was necessary to study not consciousness, but behavior.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
That's where they are called behaviorists.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.000
They studied the reaction of a person, his reaction to some things happening from the outside.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That is, to certain irritants, let's say, external.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Studying the direct connections of stimuli and reactions, reflexes,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
behaviorism attracted the attention of psychologists to study the skills, skills and experience.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
He opposed psychoanalysis.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Behaviorism initiated various psychological and psychotherapeutic schools.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000
By the way, today, not so fashionable as it was fashionable 10 years ago,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000
the so-called NLP, Neuro-linguistic programming.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It is very controversial how useful it is, how not useful it is,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
what this NLP actually affects when it affects a person.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:52.000
But the basis for NLP and behavioral therapy was behaviorism.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Freud, Pavlov and behaviorism.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
These are three bricks on which various tendencies, schools, theories arose and collapsed.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000
It is interesting to note that the Americans had an ambiguous relationship with Sigmund Freud.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000
For example, psychoanalysis was almost devoted to anathemas and was considered a false science.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Although later they reduced the momentum a little and decided that it was not a false science,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:39.000
that psychoanalysis could be used, but in psychiatry and only by those who have a doctor's diploma, a medical diploma.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
People without such a diploma cannot do psychoanalysis in America.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Such things happened in the middle of the last century.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:01.000
In our country, in the 30s, behaviorism was developing.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
By the way, Bekhterev was one of those who considered and studied these issues.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:19.000
But, as in many scientific trends of those years, they were unpopular, harmful.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
It's almost like Weissman and Morgan in genetics, for which Vavilov suffered.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
The same was here.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Such subtle things were considered wrong.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
They did not agree with the concept of the construction of communism and socialism.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And as a science, it developed only abroad.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Why are we going to consider Western theories and Western scientists?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Because since the 30s, it was forbidden to do this.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Literally, for fear of death.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And there is only one hope that now, as the country develops,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:21.000
as experience accumulates, maybe some of you will contribute to the creation of new theories, new trends.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Maybe some of you will be interested and will do this in your life.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And I am sure that in 10-15 years we will have our own scientists, academics, our own works, theories, schools.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I would really like to hope for this.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
But for now, we will see everything that was created not by us, but before us.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
We will see what we can use and how we can use it, how useful it can be.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And we will take something for granted and say, I know this, it's interesting, but in this case it is not applicable, because it has accelerated.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Or it does not match the views that I adhere to.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
To management, to business, to motivation.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
The Bifurcat theory of motivation.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:22.000
The Bifurcats noted that the term motivation is too general and not scientific enough.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
To be honest, I agree with them somewhere.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:36.000
It is really very general and today there are so many different theories that it is more theoretical than scientific, although it can be scientific as well.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Experimental psychology, under this name, actually studies the needs.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
We will talk a lot about this.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Or the attraction of the drive.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
There is a theory of drives, that is, the theory of attraction.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
By the way, now this is a very fashionable word, drive.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Do you have a drive or do you not have a drive to work?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Slang, which came to us quite recently, was used more than 80-70 years ago as one of the theories of motivation.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Do you have a drive? That is, a movement, an attraction, to do something.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I am motivated by work, some process.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I have a desire to drive.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Drive is like to lead, to manage.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I like to manage the process.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And, of course, these attractions had a purely physiological nature.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Behaviorists explained behavior through the scheme of stimulus-reaction.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Again, let's remember Pavlov.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
This is their brick, on which they built their building.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Pavlov's dog.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Stimulus-reaction, unconditional and conditional.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
And considering the stimulus as an active source of reaction.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Based on this, motivation began to be understood as a state.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I am motivated, I have a state that makes me do something.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Because the function of this state drives my body to move.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
That is, I am motivated to act, live, work, think actively.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
There is an external stimulator, of course, but it exists.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
For example, what is the most active stimulator for motivation, for drive?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Our boss came and said,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Sidorov, come to the desk and do what I told you in the morning.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Great drive, motivation, reaction.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
The boss said, under this reaction, I am quickly motivated,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I sit at the table like a bunny, I do everything.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Here is the stimulus-reaction.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Please, it doesn't work, it works, great.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
The system is in action.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000
So, behaviorists considered motivation as a drive.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
As something that had a purely physiological nature.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Stimulus-reaction.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
What other theories arose?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
The theory of reinforcement of motives.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000
The theory was new, but as we say, everything new is well forgotten old.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:41.000
If we remember that the theory of reinforcement of motives had a hedonic theory,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and hedonism is an ethnic doctrine,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000
originally developed in the ancient Greek Kyrenean school of the 4th century BC.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
It's not even the last century.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
The goal of life and the highest good was to enjoy.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:09.000
When I was preparing for this lecture, I read it with pleasure and thought,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
how it corresponds to the spirit of our time.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Many people now enjoy the good and believe that the goal of life is to achieve the good and enjoy.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
This is what they work for.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Motivation? Motivation.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Yes, this is their motivation.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Enjoyment is not a reward for the good, but the good itself.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
This was the opinion of the philosophers and Epicureans of ancient Greece.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And they are philosophers.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
It's interesting that enjoyment is not a reward, but a benefactor.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
It's a deep philosophical thought, but we won't dwell on it.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Although you can think about it on the board.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000
The good is defined as something that brings enjoyment.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
If something brings me pleasure, it's good.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And if it's suffering, it's evil.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
It's simple and logical.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
The Greeks formulated two principles, which are also very logical.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
The Greeks were wise in many things, including medicine.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
People strive to maximize pleasure.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
It works now.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And people strive to minimize suffering.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
It also works.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Why should I multiply my suffering when I can multiply my pleasure?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And live for pleasure.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
A great theory.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
It works for many.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
It can be said to be the goal of life for a certain level.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:59.000
It can be said that it's bad or good.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
There are people who think it's good.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
They accept it and they are effective.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Because it's motivation for them.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And for someone motivation is a completely different principle.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Absolutely different.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Taking the principle of hedonism as a basis,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Thorndike proposed the law of effect.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Behavioral reactions, which follow the perceived experience, are fixed.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
But if the reaction follows unpleasant experience, they disappear.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Is it logical? Yes.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Again, motivation is a reaction.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Motivation with a plus.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I will remember it.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
It's good.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
If I did this job well,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
and I did it like this, I will remember it.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And I was given a bonus for it.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I will remember it.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I will work like this.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
But if I did it like this,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
and I was told to fire me if I did it again,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
I will not work like this.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Motivation and reaction.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
It works.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
There are many people and many options for different methods.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
It's perfect to have employees who are all like a selection.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
All from the same incubator.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And all listen to the same team.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And they are motivated by something simple and ordinary.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
There are no such people.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Therefore, there are so many opinions and approaches.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Therefore, management of human resources is not only science.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
It requires colossal endurance, calmness and good health.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
So, not only Thorndike was engaged in the theory of motif reinforcement.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Ihal was engaged in this theory.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Let's pay attention again.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
There is a father, a founder, a brick, and a large building grows on it.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Again, a brick and a building.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And then a plaza and a huge pyramid.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:13.000
He, as a habit, understood the connection between the reaction and a specific stimulus,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
which arose as a result of positive reinforcement or punishment.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000
He didn't offer anything radically different from Thorndike.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
He just deepened and developed it.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
He changed his mind a little.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.000
In principle, the theory of motif reinforcement has several authors.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
They looked at the same thing from different points of view.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
This also has a right to life.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Skinner demonstrated that behavior can be effectively changed by reinforcing the desirable and ignoring the undesirable.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Let's manage people this way.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
We will actively highlight and praise those who are effective.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And we will not react to those who do not work very well.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
We will not scold them.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
We will not offend them.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
We will not close the doors to their reactions.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
We will not let them do this.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
By the way, this is a really interesting approach.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
It can also be used today.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
We can actively reward, raise salaries, motivate with education,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
give vouchers for rest to all families,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
to the best employees,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
so that others would be envious of this theory,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:58.000
but so that others would want to succeed next year.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I agree with him that he left the punishment.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Punishment can force, change behavior.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Punishment never leads to efficiency.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
If we take the history of our country,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
what has been talked about a lot in recent decades,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
there were many films about the system of camps, the system of punishment.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
One of the theories is that we have become such a power

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
because we want to ask the question,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
if there were no camps,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
maybe we would have become even more powerful,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
even more interesting,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
and maybe we would not have had such shocks.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Maybe punishment is not necessary.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
An interesting point.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000
In this case, I like Skinner because he does not reject,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
he just lowers the punishment.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Maybe in management, for some it is not his style,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
and for some it is the style that a person was looking for,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
or the one that he uses in everyday work.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:25.000
There is a group of theorists,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
let's say, theorists who are already closer to us in time,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
who, using those bricks and foundations,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000
began to develop more deep

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
and motivated theories.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
The most famous, the first brick in this pyramid,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
is Abraham Maslow.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000
He is followed by Alderfer, McLelland,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
and he is written and pronounced differently,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Herzberg,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
but more often Herzberg,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
if you see it written differently,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
you mean that it is the same person.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Let's consider the theory of each of them.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
All of them are based on the theory of Abraham Maslow,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
so we will dwell on his theory in detail.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
If you remember, a few slides ago I said

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
that even in Western companies,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
although this theory is more than 40 years old,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
the most common knowledge is Maslow's theory,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
which is known by the management.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
In principle, this theory is really interesting,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
controversial, but in any case,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
it reflects in great detail

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
the various motivational principles

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
that exist in a person.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Let's consider the motivational theory in detail.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
After that, I advise you to return to this slide

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
and look at everything highlighted in blue.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
What is the difference between them?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Although they are all based on the same thing.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Maslow's theory, the main brick,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
the main one for building a pyramid.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Everyone later relied on this theory,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
argued with it, agreed, disagreed,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
refined, developed.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Abraham Maslow divided the needs

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
into primary and secondary.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
There are five steps in total.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
There are more detailed maps,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
but if someone is interested,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
he can already see the original source.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
I do not advise reading any literature

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
on this topic,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
any analytical one.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
If you are interested,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
read only the primary sources.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
You are smart, educated, interested people.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Make your own conclusions,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
analyze them yourself.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
First, it will be your personal experience,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
which will be reflected in your practice.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
It is the individual, unique, exclusive.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And no one will tell you better than the primary source

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
about the theory of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
like Maslow himself.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
So, in this case, in this lecture,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
these are the strokes, this is the quintessence.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
If you want to dig deeper,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
go to the primary source.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Read Freud, Maslow,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
read someone else who interested you.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
No, you will have enough knowledge

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
to understand where it comes from,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
what is taken,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
and what can be used for yourself.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
That is, the main aspects,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
the strokes, the Rakhmetov method.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
We read only what we need,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
if you want to go to the primary source for your soul.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
So, Maslow.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Five steps.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
The first, the simplest.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Water, air, food.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
We can't live without it.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
It's physiology.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
These are our physiological needs.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
The second step is safety.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
It is really very important

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
to have stable work.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
The third step is the need for social contacts,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
belonging to an organization.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
The fourth step is the need for recognition.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Look, each step adds.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
It doesn't mean that if a person has a need for recognition,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
he doesn't need a physiological need.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
It's just that there is a need for recognition.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
And the third step is the need for social contacts.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
He doesn't need a physiological need for recognition.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
It's one of the other things.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
That's why it's a pyramid.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
And the last and the highest is the need for self-expression,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
for the disclosure of one's own abilities,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
in creativity, in various relationships, in growth,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
in everything.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Are all five steps inherent in everything?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Yes and no.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
It depends on how much we need it today.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Imagine a person who is 20, 35 and 65 years old.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
What needs will they have?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I think that a person who is 25

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
will have all five needs.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
He will definitely need to disclose the need for self-expression.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
For someone who is 65,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
there will be enough safety needs.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
He has already achieved everything in life.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
He has seen everything.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
He has been in all roles,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
in all situations.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Now he is already old.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
We all have a physiological need.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
But he needs a stable pension,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
medical care,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
and safety needs for him.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
So that no one attacks him on the street.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
He will live his life in his country house,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
reading books,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
going to museums,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
meeting friends.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
He may not need social contacts.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
For someone, they will need to go to the theater,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
to the museum.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
For someone, they will need self-expression.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Such people continue to work.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
These are creative people,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
these are unchanging leaders.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
People work until the age of 80-90.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
If we take people of science, actors,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
and many other specialties,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
it does not matter.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
It can be a person of a working specialty,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
who continues to work when he is over 70.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
He has needs that do not allow him to stop

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
and calmly go to rest.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
These needs

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
actually depend on the state

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
in which we see a person.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Either he becomes in a state of rest,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
or he is looking for something in life,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
because he is going further and further

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
on this ladder.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Let's start with the third stage.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
The first, physiological, and the second

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
are very simple and understandable.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
The third stage is social needs.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
For us, a person,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
in an organization,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
what does it mean?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
For the leaders,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
how can I provide my employees

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
with this need?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
How can I close it?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
How can I create a single team at work?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
How many trainings are there now,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
even out-of-town,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
on team building, on creating a team?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Here it is, the third need.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Periodically hold a general meeting,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
both a general and a managerial one.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Do not destroy informal groups without need.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Why?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
We have not yet talked about informal groups.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
They exist in every organization,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
absolutely in every one.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Some have a plus sign,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
others have a minus sign.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
There are formal and informal leaders.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Often, informal leaders

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
can be stronger than formal leaders.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
How to influence and how to fight?

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
In theory, this is a topic of a separate lecture.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
And it would be ideal to include

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
conflictology, psychology,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
psychotypes,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
managing conflicts

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
and stress resistance

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
in this topic.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
All together.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Because it is a very serious and deep topic.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
In principle,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
the advice is this.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
If there are informal groups,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
it is not recommended to destroy them.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
This is a fact.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
But to try to control them,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
or at least keep your hand on the pulse,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
what happens?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
What kind of leader? How does he influence?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Maybe he has a very positive influence on everyone.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Or vice versa.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
What will be harmful for the organization?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Try to control without destroying.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Create conditions for the activity

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
of employees outside the organization.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Corporate holidays are very popular now.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
There are no companies

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
where corporate holidays

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
were not held at least in the New Year.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
In any. Absolutely.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
General outings,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
summer holidays,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
barbecues, sports events.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
For example,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
a coffee shop is very important.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
If you have a huge office

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
and there is a coffee shop on the floors,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
where people can come to pour coffee,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
tea, water, talk,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
communicate,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
it is very important.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
By the way, I did not write,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
but a smoking room

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
is also a place where a person

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
satisfies social needs.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
This is a place where you can find out,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
as in a coffee shop,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
all the latest news,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
gossip,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
and hear at meetings.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
An amazing place.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
In many companies it is now forbidden to smoke,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
so the center is in a coffee shop.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
If there were no coffee shops,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
it would probably be good to create them.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
The fourth step.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
The need for respect.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Indeed,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
when I respect a person,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I trust him.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
That is, by trusting, I can provide

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
a person with more substantive work,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
evaluate and encourage employees,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
show respect to them,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
provide some additional rights,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
impose some additional duties

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
on a person.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
I trust, I respect a person,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
I trust him

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
more authority.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
A lot of things

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
can be done

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
in your team,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
satisfying the need for respect.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Moreover, this need exists

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
in every person who works.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Any person,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
any person who works,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
wants to be respected,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
appreciated in the team.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
This is very important.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Any person

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
is pleased

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
to hear at least from time to time

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
that he or she likes

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
how you work.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Well done. This is very important.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Probably, without this,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
there is no real leadership

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
of people.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
People often react

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
to such comments

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
more emotionally,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
there is a surge of

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
more efficiency than the bonus.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Well, the bonus is a bonus.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Yes, I earned it, it's nice.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
But you work very well,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
keep up, I'm watching you.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Well done.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
It is often expensive.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Very expensive,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
especially from the manager,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
and if it is in the presence of comrades,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
employees,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
it is very important.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
The last stage is self-expression.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
It is not always achieved,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
not everyone needs it.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
For example, work that allows

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
to develop one's abilities,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
one's potential,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
or difficult work,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
work that allows to make decisions on one's own.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
In principle, this is already the leaders

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
of the highest link.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Work that allows them to make decisions on their own.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
By and large,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
it is like a disease,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
like a strong drug.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
In general, leadership is really a drug.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
The ability to solve difficult tasks

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
is often fast.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Once we counted with colleagues

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
with managers of the highest link

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
how much time they often spend

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
on making difficult decisions.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
These are top managers.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Managers who have the right

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
to solve strategic issues,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
issues of the budget,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
which can be changed

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
by a simple move of the story

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
in this company.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Often on very serious things.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
After some work,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
how much time do they spend?

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Many said,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
sometimes half a minute,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
sometimes one and a half.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
That is, a second.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Literally once,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
I take responsibility.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Yes, I made a decision.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
This is a drug,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
but it is very important

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
for people of this kind.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Creative work, of course,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
is also a certain drug,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
natural self-expression

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
and getting new knowledge

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
and information.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Let's go back to the IT sector.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Getting new knowledge and information

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
is not only self-expression for them,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
it is a necessary need.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Otherwise, they simply

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
do not have the right

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
to do it.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
They are late for the market.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
That is, what will be fashionable

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
in three years,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
they must know now

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
and understand how it can be applied.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
If they find out exactly in three years,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
they will be late for three years

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
in the competition.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Maslow, bricks.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
All the rest are built

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
on this brick.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Alderfer.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
He reworked the hierarchy of needs a little.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Remember, right?

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Freud, Jung and others

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
reworked his theory.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Pavlov, behaviorists,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
reworked,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
added to his theory.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
The same here.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Brick, pyramid, brick, pyramid.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
What did he change?

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
He proposed

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
to highlight three main groups

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
of needs.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
What are these groups?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
In general, this theory

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
is called

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
abbreviated ERG.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
English abbreviation.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
In Russian,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
the first is existence.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
That is, existence.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
The second is relatedness.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
That is, it is a belonging.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I translate it simply from English,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
because in the text you see

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
a little, let's say, more scientific

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
translation.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
And the needs of growth.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Growth is just development.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
So,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
existential needs.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
That is,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
existing needs.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
This is the satisfaction of basic needs.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
What are our basic needs?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Remember, the first and second steps.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
The first and second.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Physiology, air, water, food and safety.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Polyclinic,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
stable salary, pension.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Safety.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
The second is social.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Belonging.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And the fourth step.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
The third is belonging, the fourth is social.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
We establish and support

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
significant contacts, connections,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
interaction with other people.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
These two steps

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
are combined into one.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
So, the first and the second

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
are existential needs.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
The third and the fourth are social needs.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
And the fifth

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
are the needs of growth.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
The self-expression.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Here is self-improvement,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
personal growth,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
needs of self-respect.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
What did

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Alderfer do

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
new?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
He simplified the Maslow's theory.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
If we remember this theory,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
there are not five steps,

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
but only three.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
From the point of view of mathematics,

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
it is easier to remember three

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
than five.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
From the point of view of

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
the content,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
it is the same.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
The next one.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
The theory of Maclean.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
The leading role of consciousness

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
in determining human behavior.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
How interesting!

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Here something sounds

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
from what we have already considered.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Conscious, unconscious.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Here is the leading role of consciousness.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
A person has three

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
basic important needs.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
What are they?

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Here, with the Maslow's,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
he does not interfere.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
This is something separate.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
In that slide,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
there are four theories.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Comments under his theory.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
In comparison with the Maslow's theory,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
you will not find a blue highlight.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Because he really has a difference.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
What are the three

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
important needs?

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Power, success,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
and involvement.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Involvement, by the way,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
is correlated

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
with the needs of the Maslow's.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Power.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
The desire to influence other people.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Respect for self-expression in Maslow's.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
A little differently,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Maclean's theory sounds.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Maybe even more rigidly,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
more principled,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
more accentuated.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
What kind of people

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
have such needs?

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
They are good orators.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
They demand high attention

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
from other people.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Leaders.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Leaders are energetic people.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
They attract people.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
They lead people.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Success.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Bringing work to

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
a successful completion.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
People focused on the result.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Look how everything is interconnected.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
We had corporate cultures.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
The culture of power.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
The culture of achievements.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
The task, the result.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
And here it is interconnected.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
You can't consider

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
motivation separately,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
the person in the company culture separately.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Everything is together.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Everything is interconnected.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Power, success, corporate culture

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
that chooses people

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
who have needs in power,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
in management,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
in success, and involvement.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
These are people

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
who identify themselves

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
with the company.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
They are involved in what happens

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
in the company, what is done there.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
They build relationships.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
They provide help.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
They are ideal in communication.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
These are people

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
who are

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
communicative,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
sociable.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Everyone is absolutely interesting to them.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
These are the three

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
interesting needs

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
that were highlighted by McLeod.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
They are worth considering.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
And the theory of two factors.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
It is

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
the theory of Herzberg.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
The theory was created

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
based on interviews

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
taken at various workplaces

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
in different professional groups

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
and in different countries.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
The interviewers were asked to describe

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
the situation in which they felt

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
complete satisfaction and, on the contrary,

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
dissatisfaction with their work.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
I can imagine

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
how difficult the surveys were,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
how difficult it was to bring them together

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
and to draw some results.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
But he did it successfully

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
and drew the theory of two factors.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
The answers were classified

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
into two groups.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Studying the collected material,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Herzberg came to the conclusion

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
that satisfaction and dissatisfaction

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
with work are caused by

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
various factors.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
The motivating factors are motivators.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
The satisfaction factor is career growth.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Responsibility factor is

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
positive assessment of achievements.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
The content of work is

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
the main motivator.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
The factors of labor conditions

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
are hygienic factors.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
The dissatisfaction factor is

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
the amount of salary

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
compared to competitors.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
I don't like it

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
because I know that

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
competitors pay more

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
for the same work I do.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Indeed,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
everyone is watching each other.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
We should pay attention to the market.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
There is no secret in the market.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Although everyone is very careful

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
about their salaries,

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
we have a very good information leak.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Benefits, social status,

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
guarantees

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
and influence on personal life.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
This has become very popular

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
in recent years.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
It is called

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
life and work balance.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Many companies

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
take this balance

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
as a value

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
in their values,

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
in their guidelines.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
They guarantee

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
their employees

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
this unique balance.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
They say that

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
they don't need to work

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
until death.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
They say that

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
they don't need to work

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
until death.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
They say that

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
they don't need to work

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
until death.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
They say that

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
they need to sleep,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
go to a visit,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
spend time with friends.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
They say that

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
it is not right

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
to work in a duodara.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
It is not effective.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
This is where

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
life and work balance

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
comes from.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
It is from two-factor theory.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
In order to effectively motivate

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
your subordinates,

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
the boss should understand

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
the essence of the problem.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
The essence of the problem is the process.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
If the theory we have just discussed,

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
the four,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
the main subject of the video,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
were called substantive,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
the next theory we will discuss

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
is the process theory of motivation.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
There are the substantive,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
the process theory of motivation,

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
the main subject of the video,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
the process theory of motivation,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
the main subject of the video,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
and the next theory of motivation.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
The process theory of motivation

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
is based on the fact

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
that a person

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
puts in his work

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
a certain amount of effort

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
that depends not only

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
on his needs but also

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
on certain aspects of the working situation.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
A person distributes

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
the work to his subordinates.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
There are three main process theories of motivation.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
What are they?

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
The theory of expectation,

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
the presence of an active need

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
is not the only and necessary condition,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
the presence of a need

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
is not the necessary condition

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
of motivation,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
the theory of justice,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
and the model of Porter-Lowler.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
We'll discuss them later.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
The theory of expectation.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
The point is

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
why a person chooses

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
a certain line of behavior.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
The theory of expectation

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
is based on the fact

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
that

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
active needs

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
are not

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
a necessary condition

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
for motivation

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
of a person to work.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
I wonder

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
what are the keys

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
to this theory?

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
The key to this theory is

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
the result,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
validity and expectation.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
What is the result?

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
What are the interesting and strange keys?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
What is the result?

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
It is anything related to the need

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
of behavior in the workplace.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
What can be?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
For example,

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
I am stressed,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
which I got at work.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Salary, yes.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Respect from colleagues,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
is it related to the need

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
and consequence

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
of behavior at work?

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Validity is related to it.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Subjective satisfaction

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
with the result.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Subjective.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And expectation.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Expectation of successful performance

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
with the application

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
of the appropriate efforts.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
I make an effort

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
and I expect

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
a reward.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
These are my efforts

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
and my expectations for a reward.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Employees form expectations

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
related to the results

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
of their behavior using the preliminary experience.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
For example,

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
they decide how likely

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
to make something meaningful for them.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Let's take a salesman as an example.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
A successful salesman

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
thinks

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
that if he makes

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
more than 9 deals

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
per week,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
and his percentage depends

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
on the quantity

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
and volume of the produced product,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
he will get

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
a higher reward.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
It is highly likely

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
that he will make a few more calls

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
to potential buyers.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
It is a great motivation.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
But when a salesman thinks

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
that the product is well used

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
and that additional sales

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
will not change the result,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
that there will be no reward,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
that he can leave work

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
in the afternoon

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
for additional efforts,

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
and so on,

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
will he make

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
additional efforts?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
If a person is 100% sure

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
that his additional efforts

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
will lead to additional expectations,

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
that is,

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
they are realized,

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
that he made an effort

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
and his expectations were met,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
then he will do it.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
He will satisfy his needs

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
and he will work effectively.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
If he is not sure of this,

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
he will not work effectively.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
The theory of justice

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
is a very important one.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
The theory of justice

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
is the main postulate of this theory.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Employees evaluate

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
their relationships

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
by comparison.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
The theory of justice

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
is one of the most effective theories.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
We always look into the pocket of our neighbor.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Always.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
And rarely

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
we compare something else

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
except for the salary.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
I am in marketing, he is in marketing.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
We do the same thing.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
He thinks it can be different.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
He thinks he does better, more,

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
more qualified.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
I have my own subjective approach.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
The theory of justice.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Since we are in the same position,

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
we are called Aditakov,

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
marketing manager,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
we must get the same salary.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
To be fair.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
If I do not see justice,

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
I am not satisfied,

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
then, of course,

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
I strive to restore this justice.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
I will hire my boss,

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
raise my salary.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
What should I do to get a raise?

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
But Sidor in another department

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
gets other money.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
There are two options.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Either I will be fired or I will get a raise.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Until people

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
start to think

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
they get a fair reward,

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
they will strive to reduce

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
the intensity of work.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
While I go to my boss

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
and beg for a raise,

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
my efficiency is close to zero.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
I am effectively busy

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
with the theory of justice

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000
towards myself, my beloved.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
But not towards

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
the efficiency of my work.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
By the way,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
the salary review

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
is held twice a year

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
in large companies.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
They compare themselves

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
with IT specialists

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
in the market, banks, banks, etc.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Now there are more and more

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
professional companies

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
that make such reviews.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Hey Group,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
which offers these reviews,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and Watson White,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
a global supplier of salary reviews,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
have been launched.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The Russian market

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
is getting more and more

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
industry-focused.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
They hold this review twice a year

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and it is very useful for employers.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Because you can always say to your employee,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
my dear,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I have a good argument

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
that I pay you more than the market.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
You will have good arguments.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
The other question is

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
whether he will calm down

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
after this review.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It all depends on the person.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But it is always good

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
to have such an argument on the table.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The model of Porter-Lowry

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
contains features

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
of both the theory of expectation

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
and the theory of justice.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
As usual,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
the picture is the same,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
just a little different.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But the same basic premise.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And they argue with it,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
improve, finish.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
The same here.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So, what have they changed

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
in these two theories

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and what have they come to?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So, Lyman Porter

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
and Edward Lowler

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
have been launched

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
in the same year.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And Edward Lowler

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
has developed a complex

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
process theory of motivation,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
including elements

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
of the theory of expectation

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and the theory of justice.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
What are the five variables

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
they have laid down as a basis?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
These are the efforts spent,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
the perception,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
the results obtained,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
the reward itself

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
for all this above,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
and, of course,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
the degree of satisfaction.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I spent my efforts,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I had the perception

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
that I am so effective,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
so irreplaceable,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I have phenomenal results,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
well, in principle,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
the reward suits me,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
but suddenly I find out

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
that Vasya Vasichkin

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
from the neighboring department

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
received a bonus of $100 more

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
than me.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
To some extent,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
my satisfaction will be zero

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and all my efforts

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
from the previous four points

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
will be reduced to zero

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
because the theory of justice

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
will just rumble in me,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and the theory of expectations

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
will melt like smoke.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
The results achieved

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
depend on the efforts,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
abilities,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
characteristic features

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
and awareness of their role.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
The degree of confidence

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
is also important.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
The degree of confidence

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
is that this level of effort

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
will really bring

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
a certain level of reward.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Where can there be

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
misunderstandings,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
misunderstandings?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
These are really

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
the efforts spent

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and the results obtained.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
It seems to me

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
that the level of confidence

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
is not what I expected.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But my boss thinks

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
otherwise.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Therefore, my reward

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
is not what I expected.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And in this theory,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
of course,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
a certain ratio

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
is established

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
between the reward

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
and the results.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And this ratio

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
is very important

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
to calculate correctly.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
To position it correctly

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and to convey it

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
to the employee correctly.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
If you want to get

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
this reward,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
describe clearly

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
what it should do and how.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And at each stage

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
what result do you expect from it?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Then he will consider

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that he got it

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
fairly or unfairly

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
not received it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Because, as a rule,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
when a person has received

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and there are no questions

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
according to his expectations,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
it will be easier for you

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
to explain to your employee

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
that the theory of his expectations

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and your theory of fairness

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
are just

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
in full correlation

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
with each other.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And there should be a complete

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
mutual understanding that

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
if he made more efforts

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
in these and in these places,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
then his expectations in terms of reward

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
would be justified to a greater extent.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Let's continue our conversation

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
about the model of Porter-Lowler.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
They explained the mechanism of motivation

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
as follows.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The results achieved by the employee

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
depend on

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
three variables.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
1. The efforts spent.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
2. Abilities.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
3. Characteristics of a person.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And here, in the subsection,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
consciousness plays

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
its role

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
in a certain process.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
In this process of achieving results.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So, the efforts, abilities

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and characteristics of a person

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
are spent.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Speaking from the employee's

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
own perspective,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
the employee always takes into account

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
the efforts spent.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And what does the manager take into account

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
when comparing employees?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Is it only the efforts spent?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
No. Abilities.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
One is more capable than the other.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Or one has one ability,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
the other has another.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Someone is very motorized,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
and starts the project easily.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But in order to continue

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
the project to the end,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
to do routine work,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
for example,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
you need people with different abilities

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and characteristics.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
For example, if you have cholera at the beginning,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
then you have bloodsuckers and melancholy.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Therefore, the characteristics of a person

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
play a very important role

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
when achieving results.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Some people are more successful

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
and achieve more results,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
others are less successful

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
and achieve fewer results.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Is it because

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
those who achieve fewer results

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
are not in their place,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
do not do their job,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and in general,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
should we ask the question

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
that maybe we should change them

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
to more successful ones?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
The question is complex.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Maybe. Or maybe not.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Because not all people can be equally successful.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
And not every person

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
can be equally successful

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
from year to year.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
There are always ups and downs

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
for every person.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And another

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
very interesting point

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that should be noted

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
is that the level of effort

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
in turn depends

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
on the value of the reward

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and on how much

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
a person believes

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
in this connection

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
between his expenses and efforts

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
and the possibility of receiving

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
this reward.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
A very important remark

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
is the value of the reward.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
If a person is not interested

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
in his $100 bonus

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
because it is not money for him,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
he will not

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
spend

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
the maximum of his efforts

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
very effectively.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
If $100 bonus is a matter

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
of life and death,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
the result will be completely different.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
If the value of the reward

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
is not money,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and, for example,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
if a person does it,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
he will have a career growth

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
up the ladder.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And for him this value

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
will be extremely effective.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
If he does not have such a goal,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
he does not want to make a career.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I met many such people

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
because they are interested

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
in developing at a professional level.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
By the way, salaries also move

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
in two directions.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Here we have a career vector

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
and a vector of professionalism.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
If before the higher the manager

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
in the position, the more salary,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
now colossal salaries

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
are required to become a professional.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
To do this, you do not need to occupy

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
a high position in management,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
it is enough to be a professional

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
in your field, a guru,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
to receive often more

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
than a top manager.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
That is, the value of the reward,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
if a career prospect opens up for me

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and I am interested in it,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I will work.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
If not, then no.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And it is very important

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
to determine

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
what other achievements

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
require a level of result

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
can attract

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
internal rewards.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
What else is important for a person?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
We have already talked about the award.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Praise.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Promotion in service.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That is, if I am awarded

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
with all the company,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I think that

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
such a goal is worthy

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
of my efforts.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Here is such a model

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
combining the theory of expectation

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
with the theory of justice.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
It was created, by the way,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
very interesting.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Again, applicable.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
How many people,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
how many theories,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
how many theories,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
how many different adherents

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
of this approach.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Each model is interesting,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
applicable in practice.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I think that

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
some of the listed things

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
that we have studied today,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
that you will take into account,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
you have already used,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
you will use.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
In any case,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
these are existing models,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
they work and are applied

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
in practice in companies.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
In conclusion,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
we will talk a little,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
we will summarize

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
and talk about

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
what we have studied today

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and how we can use it.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
The first,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
probably, are the questions

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
that the head of any link

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
should ask himself

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
on motivation.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
After listening, analyzing

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
all the material,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
think and ask yourself,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
what do my subordinates need?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
There are two directions.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
The first one.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
What do my subordinates need?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And the list.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
What do they need?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
For example, more attention

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
from the head, that is, from me.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
More attention to details,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
to some informal groups.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That is, to determine

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
what exactly is interesting for them.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Probably, to use

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
an annual interview for this.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Or just to talk to people,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
to organize a meeting,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
to discuss.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
The second step,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
which prompts this question,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
the second option is

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
do I know what they need at all?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Maybe you know

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and will quickly write a list.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Or have you not thought about it at all?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Should they need something?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
They are paid so much,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
everything is fine.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Think about it.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
In what world

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
do the needs satisfy

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
during the activity

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
aimed at achieving the goal of the organization?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
That is, your organization has some goals

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
and there are people.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And how much

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
these goals and needs of people

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
who work in the organization

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
for these goals are satisfied?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
That is, if people are satisfied,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
it is clear that the organization

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
will achieve these goals.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Another question.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
If the satisfaction of work

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and productivity

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
of employees has increased,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
why did it happen?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's a good question.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Indeed.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And if they have not grown,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
why did it happen?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
When they have grown,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
they usually ask

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
why?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
They never ask so strictly.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Why are you so effective?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Interestingly,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
in my practice,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Western managers

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
asked managers

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
why they had such

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
large sales this year,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
even with a voice complaint.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
The managers were shocked.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
They said,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
they sell so much more

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
than planned.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
A very reasonable answer.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
You had the wrong budget.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
You lowered the budget.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
The budget should be different.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
If the budget was not 100,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
but 120,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and the implementation is 125,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
then the bonus would be

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
only 5%

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
for the re-implementation of the budget

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
of 120.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Otherwise, it turns out 25,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
because the budget was 100.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Everything is interconnected.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
The effective work can

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
make the management happy.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Sometimes it will make you happy

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
when the organization is formed,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
and sometimes it won't.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It means that

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
something was planned wrong.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
When you ask questions,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
other questions arise.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
How to measure

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
the results of the work?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Can it be measured?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
How can it be measured?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
If it is possible to measure

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and how often should it be evaluated?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
How much did we achieve

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
our goals?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
If we have not advanced enough,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
we know why

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and what to do

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to not fail

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
in business next year

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and not be out of the market.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Do not leave it.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Do not lose your share

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
in the market, your interest, your margin.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
These questions are very correct.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And it is true that

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
the result of the work is

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
not only the financial result.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Remember, we talked about

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
the depth of the hierarchy,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
the depth of the structure.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Then the question of the organizational

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
health index arises.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
The health index

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
and the survey of the

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
health index

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
are the main

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
questions.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
The health index

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
and surveys

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
help us

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
measure the result

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
of the work,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
the motivation of the staff,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
the assessment of the work

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
of people.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
All these things,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
surveys, reviews,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
surveys, give us the opportunity

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
to see the picture

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
of all our

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
victories and defeats

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
very clearly.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
They give us a good opportunity

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
to analyze

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
what we need to do,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
how to act correctly,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
or at least

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
where to look for

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
answers to these

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
very difficult questions.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
These questions

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
often depend on

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
whether

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
companies will stay in the market.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The next group

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
is not about questions,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
but about advice.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Although,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
we can also give you some information

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
to think about.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Some advice on

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
meeting the social needs of the staff.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Now we will repeat

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
what we have learned.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Remember, social needs

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
are the third and the fourth

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
group of steps

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
in the Maslow's pyramid.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
In order to satisfy

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
these needs of the staff,

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
what should you do

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
as a manager?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Give the employees

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
a job

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that would help

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
them communicate.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
If you see that you have

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
employees who have

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
a strong need,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
it is important for them

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
as air,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
communication is air,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
try to find

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
an application for them.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Maybe they will

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
work in a corporate newspaper,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
maybe they will work in corporate

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
departures,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
maybe they will

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
work in a company

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
that is not necessarily

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
their job,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
but it will give them

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
an opportunity to express themselves.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Create a team spirit.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
We have already talked about

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
the importance of

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
a team spirit.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Of course, hold

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
meetings with your employees.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
It is very important

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
to inform your employees

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
about what is going on in the company.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Why is it important?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
First, it gives you an opportunity

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
to understand the feedback

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
of your employees

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
in addition to satisfying

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
the social needs of the staff.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
What worries them?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
What bothers them?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Stop rumors.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
It is also a very interesting topic.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Rumors in the organization are sometimes

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
created on purpose, sometimes they are cultivated.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
It is a completely different topic.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
But they also need to be controlled.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Even if you create them for some reason,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
they also need to be controlled,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
you also need to keep your hand on the pulse.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
These meetings will help

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
to manage these things.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Do not try to destroy

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
the existing informal groups.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
If, of course, they do not

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
bring some negative component

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
to the organization,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
or do not cause damage,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
it is not worth it.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
On the contrary,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
take the most out of this benefit.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And, of course,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
create some conditions

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
for the members of your organization

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
outside of its framework.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Corporate parties, for example.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
A great option.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Satisfaction of the need

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
for respect for the staff.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
How can this be done?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Offer subordinate more substantive work.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
For example,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
without adding a deposit,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
without changing your position,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
just say, seeing that a person has

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
such a huge rush,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
say, listen, help is needed.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Help in this direction,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
in this project.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Can you help?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Your knowledge is irreplaceable.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
This level is very necessary.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
A person will be happy.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
If a person has this need,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
he will be happy.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
He will be satisfied and will not

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
require a reward,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
because the reward for him,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
the respect and trust he has

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
is already a reward.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Provide your employees

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
a positive feedback

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
on the results.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Remember, we talked about

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
the fact that there is a knot,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
and that it is better to refuse punishment.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Right. It is better to encourage.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I encouraged these people,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I also wanted others to be encouraged.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
They will try.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
What are they worse at?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
They also want to be good.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Attract your employees

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
to the development of decisions.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Trust, again, trust and respect.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Consult,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
learn their opinion.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Often they can suggest

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
absolutely ideal options

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
to get out of difficult situations.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Often they seem to be dead ends.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Our people are very smart, talented, creative.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
When you ask them,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
they say, why are you silent?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And no one asked.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Ideas are amazing.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And, of course,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
the property of delegating

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
subordinates of additional rights

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
and powers comes from this.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Of course, they will ask you.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
If I trust you,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I will ask you.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
You will answer me.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Not me to cover you,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
but you will answer for me.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Not for me, but for yourself.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
As a manager,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
a person is responsible for all the mistakes of the department.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And the manager who says

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
that I am not Sidorov is a fool.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
A normal manager will never say that.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
He will say, I am to blame.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Yes, because you are the manager,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
you are paid salary.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
As a manager, you are obliged

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
to take all the risks.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
But delegating

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
is clear that

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
if something goes wrong,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
the manager will be punished

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
for the project lost.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Even for delegating.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
But this blow

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
should also be able to keep.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
This is professionalism.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And also an important point.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
If there is an opportunity

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
to promote subordinates on the career ladder.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Again, the hierarchy in the company

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
22 steps, 6 steps.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
More can be promoted,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
less can be promoted.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
But you can promote inside the steps.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Remember, we just talked about

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
that there is a career ladder

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
upstairs and professional.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
The professional can be

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
younger, older, leading, guru.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Let's say,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
several steps on this flat line

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
we drew.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
There is such an opportunity

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
promotion.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
It's a ladder,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
but a career ladder.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And salary also depends on it.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And education.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It's a great motivator.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
People improve their level,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
competence, qualification

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
and communicate.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
By the way, education can be attributed

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
to the satisfaction of socialization.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
During the training,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
if people from different departments are mixed,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
they often get to know each other

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
because they have never had to meet.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
The needs in self-expression of the staff.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
How to satisfy them?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Provide subordinates

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
with the opportunity to learn and develop.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Look, the learning and development

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
goes through all the needs.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
We respect you,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
trust you,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
we believe that you are loyal,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
that you will not leave us,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
we invest money in you,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
we count on you.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Socialization.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You can talk to people,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
compare yourself with others.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Self-expression.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
During the training,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
you can show yourself,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
you will be noticed,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
maybe we will look at you with different eyes.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
From different sides,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
education is a very motivating factor.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
The main thing is to use it correctly.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And the results of the training.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
To give subordinates a difficult job,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
requiring them to give their all.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
This is the highest trust.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And of course,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
people have a colossal self-expression.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Because something new

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
is absolutely for them,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
it mobilizes.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And they are more effective.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Not only what they did routinely,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
but this is what captures them,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
attracts.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Again, those who are motivated by it.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And to start developing

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
creative abilities in every possible way.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
If the company has the opportunity,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
to direct these people

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
to some different projects.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Well,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
that's all for today.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Dear colleagues,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I hope that your time

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
was not wasted in vain.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
In any case,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I really hope that all the material

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
that we discussed today

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
will be useful for you.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And that the lecture was interesting.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
It seems to me that

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I will not make any special recommendations

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
on reading books,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
literature on this topic.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Because, again,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I repeat,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
read the primary sources.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It is very interesting.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Actually,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
it will be your communication with the author.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
If we remember Munchausen,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
remember when he said

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
that he communicates directly with Shakespeare.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Please communicate directly

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
if you are interested in Freud,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Maslow,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
with other theorists.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Because, probably,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
this will be the most correct communication

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
not through the prism

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
of someone else's perception.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
It will be only you

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and only the person

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
who was the founder of the theory.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And, of course,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
read the primary sources.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Because all the others

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
have worked on it,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
but in any case,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
the basis was laid

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
by some specific theorist.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Start working

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
on it if it is interesting for you.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And, in principle,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
all the knowledge that you have received today

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
will be more than enough

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
for you as a manager

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
to first of all

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
look at yourself,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
at what kind of person you are,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
what company you work in,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
what style of management you have,

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
how you work with your subordinates,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
whether you can motivate them,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
whether you can listen to them,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
how you recruited your staff,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
how you plan

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
your employees' career growth.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
All those aspects

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
that are very important

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
for your subordinates,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
for your employees,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
and for you in relation to your management

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
will be the necessary factors for your life.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Thank you very much for your attention.
