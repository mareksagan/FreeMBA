WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Average variable costs.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
We divide the variable costs into the output.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
How much was there?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
100 by 10 is 10,

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
105 by 11 is 9.55.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
And finally, average total costs.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
How can we calculate?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
We can divide the total volume,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
the total costs into the output volume,

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
or we can just sum up

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
the average constant and average variable costs.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Before, they were 5 plus 10,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
15 average total costs.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Now they are 4.55,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
4.55 plus 9.55,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
14.1.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
And the last column contains the limit costs.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
The limit costs are only one value.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
The limit costs are the addition of the total costs

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
when the output is 1.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
The addition of the output is 1,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
the addition of the total costs is 5.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
5 by 1 is 5.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
The limit costs are 5 rubles.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
These are additional costs

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
that we will have to bear

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
if we increase the output from 10 to 11.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Please note that the limit costs

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
can also be calculated by dividing the addition of the variable costs

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
by the addition of the output.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
5 divided by 1 is 5.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Let's move on to the fourth question of our topic.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
The costs in the short term.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Let me remind you once again

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
that the short term in the microeconomics

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
is the period during which

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
some factors of production can't be changed,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
while others can be changed.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Usually, the capital is considered

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
the variable factor of production,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
and the labor is considered the variable factor.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
Accordingly, the costs of capital in the short term

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
are the constant costs,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
and the costs of labor in the short term are the variable costs.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
Let's see what the functions of costs in the short term can be.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Let's start with the constant costs.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Look at the slide.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Once again.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
The constant costs are the costs

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
that do not change with the change in the volume of the output.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Look.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The output changes in the left graph,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
and the constant costs do not change.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Accordingly, the function of the constant costs

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
is a straight line parallel to the x-axis.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Now let's talk about the function of the average constant costs.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
How are the average constant costs calculated?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
We've already talked about it.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
They are obtained by dividing the constant costs by the volume of the output.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
The constant costs are not changed by the numerator,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
but the volume of the output is changed by the denominator.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, ask any value of the constant costs.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Let's say 10.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Let the output be equal to 1.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
What are the average constant costs?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
10 divided by 1 is 10.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Let's say the output is equal to 2.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The constants do not change.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
What are the average constants?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
10 divided by 2 is 5.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Let the output be equal to 5.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
The average constant costs 10 divided by 5 is 2.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Let the output be equal to 10.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
10 divided by 10 is 1.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
10 divided by 10 is 1.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Let the output be very large.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
The average constant costs are 10.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
10 to a very large value will be a very small value.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Accordingly, with the increase in the output,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
the average constant costs tend to zero.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
In general, the function of the average constant costs

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
is a parable,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
hyperbola, excuse me,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
which is visible on the right side of the graph.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And how will the functions of other costs change?

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Here, the answer cannot be given unambiguously.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Everything will depend on the assumptions.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Let's first consider the simplified functions of costs.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
They are based on the assumption

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
that the maximum costs are constant.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
What does it mean that the maximum costs are constant?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
This means that with the increase in the output,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
the costs are increasing all the time

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
at the same value.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Let's take an example from trading.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Let there be a store in front of us

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
that sells, say, beer.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
For trading, the volume of the output

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
is the number of sold goods,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
that is, sold bottles of beer.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
What are the costs in trading usually?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
They are variable.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
To sell beer,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
you need to buy it from the store.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
The more beer we sell,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
the more beer we have to buy.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Accordingly, the costs of buying beer

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
increase with the volume of sales,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
that is, with the volume of the output.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Therefore, for trading,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
the costs of buying are variable.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
All other costs, let's consider them constant.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Those that do not change with the increase in the output.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The rent is not changed,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
the electricity is not changed,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
the costs of electricity,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
even if no one bought anything from us,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
the rent must be paid,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
the store is open, the refrigerators are working,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
the store is lit.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
We will also consider the sales salary

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
independent of the volume of the output,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
that is, we will also consider it as a constant cost.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Look at the table.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
The output changes from 0 to 100.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
That is, the number of sold bottles changes from 0 to 100.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Constant costs I have determined in terms of 100 rubles.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
They do not depend on the output.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And variable costs, I repeat,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
are the costs of buying beer.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
Let's assume that we buy every bottle of beer for 5 rubles.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
So, if we did not buy or sell any beer,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
the variable costs are 0.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
If we bought and sold one bottle of beer,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
the variable costs are the costs of buying this bottle,

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
that is, 5 rubles.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
If we bought and sold two bottles of beer,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
the variable costs are 10 rubles.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
And so on.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
15, 20, 25, and so on.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Variable costs are increasing all the time.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
How much?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
With each next unit of the output for 5 rubles.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
These are additional costs or maximum costs.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Look.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
The fifth column.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Maximum costs are always 5, 5, 5, 5.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
What are the total costs?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
With zero output, the variable costs are 0,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
but the constant costs still have to be carried.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
So, the total costs are constant.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
100 rubles.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
With one output, the constant costs are 100,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
the variable costs are 5, and so on.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
According to the well-known formulas,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
we can calculate the average constant and average variable costs,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
as well as the average total costs.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
But here's what I want to draw your attention to.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
The maximum costs are constant.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
With each next unit of the output,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
the maximum costs are increasing all the time

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
at the same value, at 5 rubles.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
But in this case,

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
they are necessarily equal to the average variable costs.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
In fact, if we have an output equal to 1,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
the variable costs are 5.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
With the output of 2 units, the variable costs are 10.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
With 3 units, 15.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
With 4, 20.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
With 5, 25.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
So, the average variable costs are always 5.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
The average variable costs, in my conditional example,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
are exactly equal to the purchase price of one bottle of beer.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And this is reflected in the following slide.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Look.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
We have a figure along the x-axis.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
And along the y-axis,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
we have the maximum and average variable costs.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
The maximum costs remain the same

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
with the increase in the output.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
And they are necessarily equal to the average variable costs.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
Now look at how the functions of the variable and the total costs

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
will work.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I have already talked about the constant costs.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
The function of the constant costs

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
is parallel to the x-axis.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Let's go back to our table.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Look at how the variable costs change.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
With the output of 0, they are 0.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
With the output of 1, they are 5.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
With the output of 2, they are 5.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
With the output of 3, they are 5.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
With the output of 4, they are 5.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
With the output of 1, they are 5.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
With the output of 2, they are 10, and so on.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
So the function of the variable costs

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
is a linear function

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
coming from the origin of the coordinates.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
This is how it is shown in the graph.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
And how will the function of the total costs work?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Look.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
With the output of 0,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
the variable costs, as we have already said,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
are 0.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
But the constant costs are not 0,

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
because they must be carried

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
with any volume of the output.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
So with the zero output,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
the total costs are constant.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And then the function of the total costs

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
is a linear function

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
parallel to the function of the variable costs.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
The difference between the total and the variable costs

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
is the constant costs.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
And this value does not change.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Therefore, these two functions

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
go parallel to each other.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
And now let's see

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
how the functions of the average costs work.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Let's recall the formula.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
What are the average and total costs?

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
These are the average constant costs

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
plus the average variable costs.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
What do we know about the average constant costs?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
With the increase in the output,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
they decrease and tend to 0.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And what do we know about the average variable costs?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
In this model, they do not change,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
they are a constant value.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
But if this variable decreases and tends to 0,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
and the second variable is a constant,

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
then what does the sum tend to?

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
The sum tends to the average variable costs.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
This is shown in the graph.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Look.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
The higher the output,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
the lower the average total costs,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
which, however, tend not to 0,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
but to the average variable costs.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
What conclusion can we draw?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
The higher the output,

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
the lower the average constant

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and, accordingly, the average total costs.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
A simple question.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Suppose you study the economy

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
within the framework of the MBA program.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
You study the economy as a group.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Apply the last learning I just did

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
to your group.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
It's not difficult at all.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
What is the number of listeners

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
for the MBA school?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Is it correct?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
And what do we observe?

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
The more listeners in the group,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
the less costs for the learning of one listener.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
So, we have looked at the simplified functions of costs.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Such functions usually correspond to the practice of a small business.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
But very often in business

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
you also have to face complicated functions of costs.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Here is another prerequisite.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
The maximum costs are first reduced,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
then reach the minimum,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
and then begin to increase.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Look at the slide.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
How to understand?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
At first, with the increase of the output,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
each additional unit of the product

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
requires less and less additional costs.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Then these additional costs become minimal.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
After that, each additional unit of the product

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
requires more and more additional costs.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
If soon it is so,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
all functions of costs change.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Please look at the conditional example.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
The next slide.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Here, in the first column,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
the output changes from 0 to 10.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
But the constant costs should not change by definition.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
They are always 25, 25, 25, 25.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
The variable costs change.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
How do they change?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
See in the table.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
We can calculate all other indicators.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
As always, the total costs

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
are the sum of the constant costs

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
and the variable costs.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Have you calculated?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Let's see now

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
how the function of the limit costs will change.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
How can we calculate the limit costs?

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
We take the sum of the total costs

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
and divide by the sum of the output.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
The sum of the output is always 1.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
And what is the sum of the total costs at first?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
55 minus 25. How much is it?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
First 30.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Then the sum of the total costs.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
24.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Then 20 and so on.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
What do we see?

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
The limit costs decrease all the time

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
from 0 to 5,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
reaching the value of 16.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
After that, starting from the output 6 and so on,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
the limit costs begin to increase.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
The average and constant costs always decrease.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
There is nothing new here.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
But the functions of the limit costs

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
are the sum of the average and constant costs.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
And look at what they will be now.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Here is a slide.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
The limit and average costs.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Look again.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
What happens to the limit costs?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
As I said, they decrease at first,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
then reach the minimum,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
then increase.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
What happens to the average and constant costs?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
They decrease at first,

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
but decrease slower than the limit costs.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Then look.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
At a certain interval of the output,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
the limit costs are already increasing,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
and the average and constant costs

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
are still decreasing.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
And note that the average and constant costs

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
decrease until they are even higher than the limit costs.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And from here the most important thing is

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
that the average and constant costs

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
reach their minimum

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
at the point

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
where they are equal to the limit costs.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
And finally, let's look at the function

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
of the average and constant costs.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
This function is infinite.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
For infinitely small values,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
the average and constant costs are very large,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
because the output is very small.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Then what?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
They decrease

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
and also reach their minimum

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
at the point where they are equal to the limit costs.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
At the point where they are equal to the limit costs.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
So the function of the limit costs

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
necessarily intersects the functions

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
of the average, constant and average costs

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
at their minimum points.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
After the minimum point has been passed,

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
the average and constant costs begin to increase.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And as they increase,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
they are getting closer

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
to the function of the average, constant and average costs.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Think about why this is so.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
What are the average and constant costs equal to?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
We have already talked about this.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
The average and constant costs

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
plus the average and constant costs.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
But what are the average and constant costs aiming at?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
At zero.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I have talked about this many times.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
So the average and constant costs

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
aim at the average and total costs.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
That's all.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
The fourth question of this topic is

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
the costs in the short term.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
There is also the fifth question of the topic.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
The costs in the long term.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
There is nothing fundamentally new there,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
except that I want to emphasize

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
that in the long term

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
there are no constant costs.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
All costs become variable.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Why?

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Because in the long term

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
the company can change all the production factors.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
It can hire additional workers,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
it can install additional equipment,

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
it can rent a more spacious building.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
All the production factors become variable,

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
so all the costs also become variable.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
So there is no function of average and constant costs.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
But there is one function.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
The function of the limit costs

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
and there is a function of the average costs.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
And it will be the same.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
The function of the limit costs decreases at first,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
then reaches the minimum,

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
then begins to increase.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The function of the average and constant costs

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
decreases at first,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
then reaches the minimum

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
at the intersection point

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
with the function of the limit costs.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
After that, the function of the average and constant costs

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
begins to increase.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
we begin the fourth topic of our course.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Market structures.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Company behavior.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Here we will talk about

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
how the company operates in certain market conditions.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And it is probably obvious

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
that the behavior of the company

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
depends not only on the number of resources it has,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
but also on the market environment in which it operates.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
In other words,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
the behavior of the company depends on the type of market.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
And now look at the slide, please.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
The first question that we will consider

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
is called the types of market structures.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Or we will talk about the types of markets.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Look, please.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
There is a microeconomics that highlights

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
four types of market structures

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
or the form of market organization.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
These are

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
perfect competition,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
monopoly,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
oligopoly,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
monopolistic competition.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Let's start with perfect competition.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
But very often perfect competition is misunderstood.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
They think that perfect competition

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
is something like

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
completely cruel, ruthless competition.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
In fact, it is nothing like that.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
The definition is very simple.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Perfect competition

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
is a market structure

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
in which

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
there are so many

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
sellers and buyers

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
that none of them,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
changing the volume of their offer

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
or their demand,

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
is able to affect the market price.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
The price of a product

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
on a perfectly competitive market

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
is determined by the interaction

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
of thousands of independent buyers

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and hundreds of independent sellers.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Each buyer and each seller

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
is a kind of a sand in the scale of the market

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
that can not change anything in the market

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
by their behavior.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
Let's look at the signs of perfect competition.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I have already told you about the first sign.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Look, here is the sign.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Each of the very large numbers of sellers and buyers

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
occupies such a small share of the market

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
that it cannot change the market price

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
by its behavior,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
but can sell or buy

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
as much of its product

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
at this price.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Let's take this example.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
I will give it to you,

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
it will probably fit.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Here is a friend

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
living in the Volgograd province

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
calling me to Moscow

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
and asking how much tomatoes are in Moscow.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
It was summer

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
and not last year,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I do not remember what I answered,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
well, let's say 10 rubles per kilogram.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
She had a curious curiosity.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
She was going to bring a truck with Volga tomatoes to Moscow.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
So,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
what did she get from my information?

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
The price of tomatoes in Moscow

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
is 10 rubles per kilogram.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
She came from the fact that

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
if today the price is such,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
then its appearance or not

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
in the market

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
cannot affect the price in any way.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
But on the other hand,

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
she is sure

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
that since it occupies a negligible small share

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
in the tomato market,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
it is not profitable

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
for her to sell any number of tomatoes

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
at this price of 10 rubles per kilogram.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
That is,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
a ton, three, even five,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
and she just does not have more.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
It is clear that if she brought to Moscow

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
at the same time,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
let's say, a thousand tons of tomatoes,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
then such a large seller

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
would definitely affect the price.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
But this would already be a problem.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
This is not a condition of perfect competition.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
I want to emphasize once again

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
that in the conditions of perfect competition,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
the market price is determined by the interaction

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
of thousands of independent buyers,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
hundreds of independent sellers,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
each grain in the general market scale,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
and no one taken separately

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
can affect the price.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Yes, another example,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
so that it may be better understood.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
You ran into a neighbor

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
at the entrance.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
You see that he is walking

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
from the market.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
You ask him,

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
how much are the tomatoes?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
He answers, 10 rubles per kilogram.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
So, what do you get out of it?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
If the price has risen so fast today,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
your appearance or non-appearance

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
on the market as a buyer

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
again cannot affect the price.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
But you can buy a kilogram,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
three, five, even ten rubles

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
for this price of 10 rubles.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
That is, you also feel

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
like a perfect competitor

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
on the tomato market,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
but not as a seller,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
but as a buyer.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Let's look at the graph.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
The equilibrium market price

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
and the demand curve

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
for the product of a separate company.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Look, two graphs are next to each other.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
The left graph illustrates

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
the demand and supply

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
on a completely competitive market.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I repeat again,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
there are thousands of buyers

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
and hundreds of independent sellers.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
On the x-axis,

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
we put the price

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
and the total number of tomatoes

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
sold and bought on this market.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
And what do we see?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
That at the price of P with an asterisk,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
we observe a kind of market equilibrium.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Demand on the tomato market

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
by all buyers

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
is equal to supply on this market

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
by all sellers.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Now look at the right graph.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
You see, on the x-axis

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
I put, I mean,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
the production, volume,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
the volume of Kumaloe.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
This is a separate company.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
This is, figuratively speaking,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
my tomato friend.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
If on the left graph

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
the account is at 1000 tons,

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
then on the right graph

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
her account is only at tons.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
She is a seed in the market scale.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
And she accepts

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
the market price P with an asterisk

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
as a given price.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
As economists say,

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
she is a price taker.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
She accepts this price as a given price

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
and can sell any number of her tomatoes

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
at this price.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Please note

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
that in the conditions of perfect competition

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
between the two companies,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
the price of P with an asterisk

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
cannot be increased.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
No one will buy tomatoes from her.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
What's the point

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
if there are hundreds of sellers

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
with a lower price?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
And it makes no sense

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
to reduce the price

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
because at this price

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
she can sell

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
any number of her tomatoes.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
This is the first sign

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
of perfect competition.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Let's go back to our signs.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Let's look at the second sign.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
The complete uniformity of the product.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
The absence of trademarks.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
What does this mean?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
The product of different sellers

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
is exactly the same

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
in the mind of the buyer.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
The buyers do not distinguish

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
between the sellers

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and the sellers themselves.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
But when you come to the real tomato market,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
you will still walk in rows.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
You will see

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
that here the tomatoes are redder,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
and this seller

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
seems to be less trustworthy.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
There is nothing of this

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
in the conditions of perfect competition.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
All sellers

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
are the same.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And all products are absolutely the same.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
There is no difference.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Look at the third sign.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The possibility of free entry

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
to the market

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
and leaving it.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
This means

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
that there are no barriers,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
financial, administrative,

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
whatever,

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
that prevent

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
the buyer from entering

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
the market,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
new sellers,

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
or the sellers

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
from leaving the market.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Let's try

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
such an example

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
for the sake of dissection.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Somewhere I read

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
that our current president,

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Vladimir Putin,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
in his temporary,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
although in tight financial circumstances,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
was working as a private importer

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
on his Zhiguli.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
What did this mean?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
That he just,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
on one beautiful day,

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
got behind the wheel of his car,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
drove to the streets of St. Petersburg,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
that is, entered the market

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
of a private importer.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Some time passed,

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Vladimir Putin

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
found an interesting job

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
as the President of Russia.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
This means only that

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
he calmly put his Zhiguli

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
in the garage

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
and went to work in the Kremlin.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
That is, he entered the market

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
as easily as he left it.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
This is a sign of perfect competition.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
There are no barriers

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
for entering and leaving.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
The fourth sign

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
is the perfect knowledge

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
of the market

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
by the sellers

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
and buyers.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Again,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
if you come to the real

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
tomato market,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
you will probably

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
walk in the rows,

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
look,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
maybe there

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
the tomatoes are better

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
or a little cheaper.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
There is nothing of this

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
in the condition of perfect competition.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Here all the sellers

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
and all the buyers

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
are present.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
They seem to have come together

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
at one point.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
All the information about the market

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
is the same.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
It is equally available

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
to all the sellers

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
and all the buyers.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
But if

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
we sum up

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
all that I have said,

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
then you will probably agree

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
that perfect competition

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
is an abstraction.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Such a market

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
does not exist

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
in reality.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
There are markets

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
more or less

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
adhering to this ideal,

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
but there is no market

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
in reality of perfect competition.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Then the question is,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
if there is no market

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
of perfect competition,

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
why should we study it?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
The answer is very simple.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
For the same reason

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
that a chemist

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
studies the properties, for example,

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
of absolutely pure distilled water,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
which does not exist in nature either.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
It is simply impossible

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
to understand

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
the properties of any impurities

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
if we do not understand

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
or study the subject

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
in a certain ideal state.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
I have already mentioned

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
the first type of market,

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
the perfect competition.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
The second type of market

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
is called monopoly.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Let us read the definition.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
A monopoly is a market structure

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
in which

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
the actions of the market

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
are carried out

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
by only one company

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
producing a product

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
that has no

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
close substitutes.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Monopolies are found

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
at the national,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
regional,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
and most often

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
at the local level.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
But we have national monopolies

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
in Russia,

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
in particular

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
after the reform of the RAOES,

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
the Federal Network Company

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
will monopolize

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
the main lines

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
of the power generation.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Or, let us say,

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
in our country

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
it is a national monopoly.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Or, let us say,

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
in our city

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
there is only one company

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
offering

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
certain services.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
And this is a monopoly.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
But still,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
the next market structure

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
is more common.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
The oligopoly.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
What is it?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Let us look at the definition.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
The oligopoly

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
is a market structure

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
characterized

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
by a small number

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
of active firms.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
The oligopoly

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
is a market structure

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
characterized by a small number

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
of active firms.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Here are some examples of the oligopoly.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
For example,

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
two airlines

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
on the same route.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Or in Moscow

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
the cellular network market

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
is controlled

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
by, if I am not mistaken,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
four companies.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
In general, the oligopoly

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
is considered

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
when there are

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
no active firms.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
This is a rather

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
common case

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
of the oligopoly.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
The oligopoly

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
is a very interesting

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
market structure.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Look,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
when we were looking

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
at the perfect competition,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
we saw

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
that when a particular

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
seller

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
makes a decision,

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
he does not look

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
at other sellers.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
He is a pebble

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
in the scale of the market.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
He just accepts

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
the market price.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
A monopolist

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
does not look

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
at competitors

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
for the simple reason

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
that there are no monopolies

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
in the conditions.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
But the oligopolist

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
acts as he is allowed

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
by his own capabilities

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
to influence

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
the market price

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
of the firm.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
The oligopolistic situation

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
is like a card game

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
where there is no

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
single, pre-set

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
behavior model.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Each player

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
plays as he is allowed

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
by his own cards

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
and as his competitors

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
play.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
That is,

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
a strategic behavior

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
is formed.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
At the same time,

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
a separate

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
oligopolist

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
can choose

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
a particular form of competition,

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
a particular strategy of competition,

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
or

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
adopt a strategy of

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
a conspiracy.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
This also happens.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
And the fourth type of market

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
is a monopolistic

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
competition.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Let's read the definition.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
A monopolistic competition

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
is a market structure

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
in which a group of goods

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
that are close

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
substitutes

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
is produced by a large

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
number of independent

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
firms.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
I will try to explain.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Let's recall

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
the perfect competition

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
once again.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
There were

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
a lot of firms.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Theoretically speaking,

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
there are an infinite number of firms.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
In the conditions

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
of monopolistic competition,

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
there are not so many firms,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
but there are also a lot of them.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
But there are fundamental differences.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Remember I said

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
that in the case of perfect competition,

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
the products of

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
individual firms

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
are absolutely indistinguishable

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
in the eyes of the buyers.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
And the firms themselves are absolutely the same.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
There is nothing of the sort

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
in the case of monopolistic competition.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Here,

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
each firm

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
has a certain feature

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
that distinguishes

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
its product

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
or itself

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
from other firms.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
That is,

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
it is a kind of

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
mini monopoly.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
It is a kind of mini monopoly

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
on a very narrow market segment.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Here is an example.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
There are a lot of cafes in our city.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
But I distinguish

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
this cafe from that one.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
What?

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Maybe this cafe,

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
as I think,

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
may feed better in this cafe.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Maybe there are nicer waitresses.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Maybe the interior is more attractive.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Or maybe this cafe is just

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
closer to my house.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
That is,

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
in the case of monopolistic competition,

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
I repeat once again,

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
individual firms,

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
having some distinguishable features,

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
have,

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
albeit insignificant,

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
but still monopoly power

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
on a narrow market segment.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
And now look.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
It is necessary to distinguish

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
a pure monopoly

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
and monopoly power.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Monopoly power arises

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
where a separate firm

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
has some control over the price.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
That is,

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
it can change the price

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
within certain limits.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
This is not the case

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
with perfect competition.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Please look at the left graph.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
On the left we have

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
a perfectly competitive firm.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
There I have already said

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
that in the conditions of perfect competition,

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
a separately acquired firm,

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
being a pebble

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
on a general market scale,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
can sell

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
any number of its products

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
at the market price.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
That is,

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
the demand function

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
for a product of a perfectly competitive firm

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
is a horizontal line.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
The market can buy

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
any number of its products

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
at the market price

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
from this firm.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
A perfectly competitive firm

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
cannot change the price

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
by definition.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
But a firm

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
with monopoly power

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
can change the price

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
to a greater or lesser extent.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Please look at the right graph.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
There the demand function

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
for a product of a firm

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
has a negative slope.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
This means

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
that a firm can

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
increase or decrease the price.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
But it is clear

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
that increasing the price

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
will result in a decrease

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
in the demand for its product.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
And

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
decreasing the price

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
will result in

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
an increase.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
No super monopoly

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
can cancel the demand law.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
But what is obvious

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
and important

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
is that the lower

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
the slope of the demand

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
for a product of a firm,

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
the lower

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
its monopoly power.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
So,

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
I just said

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
that

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
the slope of the demand

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
for a product of a firm

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
can be judged

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
by the extent

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
of its monopoly power.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Please look at this graph.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
The quantity of a product, as always,

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
the price of a product,

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
and let's say

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
the demand function

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
goes like this.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Look at this.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
What does it mean?

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
You see, the function has

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
a rather high slope.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
So,

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
a firm can

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
increase the price

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
quite significantly

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
from P0 to P1.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
You see,

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
a significant increase in price

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
without being afraid

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
of losing a large amount of demand.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
In other words,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
it is difficult for a consumer

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
to do without a product of this firm.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
And even with a large increase in price,

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
the decline in demand

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
will be insignificant.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
So,

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
we say

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
that a firm

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
has a large, high monopoly power.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Now,

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
imagine

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
a monopoly-competitive firm.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
The demand function

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
for its product

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
is very slow.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Let's say,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
it is a small company.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
A firm can increase the price.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
This is the demand function

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
for its product.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
But pay attention,

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
you see,

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
the firm has increased the price

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
very insignificantly.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
And how much has it lost in demand?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
A lot.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
You see,

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
a small increase in price

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
has led to a significant decline in demand.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Why is that?

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Because in a monopoly-competitive environment,

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
the product has a lot of substitutes.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Therefore,

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
with a small increase in price,

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
buyers can easily

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
switch to the product

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
of other firms.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
And what is the worst case?

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Perfect competition.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
When the supply line

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
is not in the supply chain,

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
the product is not in the supply chain.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
And the product is not in the supply chain.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
And what is the worst case?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
When the supply line

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
for a firm's product

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
becomes so sluggish

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
that it turns

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
into a horizontal line.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
That is,

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
the firm has absolutely no control

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
over the market price.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
It can only accept the price.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
So,

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
now let's look

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
at the reasons

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
why a monopoly power

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
can arise and exist.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
I will highlight

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
three reasons.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
The first reason is very simple.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Exclusive rights

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
provided by the authorities.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Let's say,

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
local or regional authorities

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
or general Russian authorities

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
allow my firm

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
to engage in this kind of activity.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
And the other firms

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
simply do not issue

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
the appropriate license.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
As a result,

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
there is an administrative monopoly.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
If the license

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
is issued by several firms,

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
we get

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
an administrative

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
oligopoly.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
And this is

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
the second reason

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
why a monopoly power

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
exists.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
It is an exclusive

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
ownership

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
of any production resource.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
I have already mentioned

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
that in order to

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
produce something,

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
resources are needed.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Imagine, please,

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
that some particularly important

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
product

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
is produced

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
by a certain company

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
and this resource

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
is in the exclusive

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
ownership

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
of this company.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Only this company

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
can produce this product.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Others cannot

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
and our company

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
is a monopolist.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
For example,

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
at one time

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
the monopolist

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
on the American

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
aluminum market

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
was Alcoa.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Alcoa was founded

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
on the fact

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
that only Alcoa

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
owned all the

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
boxes in Chile.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Or only this surgeon

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
can perform

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
a unique surgery.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
He is a monopolist

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
of his talent.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Only he has

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
a great talent

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
and on this basis

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
a monopoly arises.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Or

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
only this company

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
has a patent

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
for the latest

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
technological development.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Again,

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
it becomes a monopolist.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
If any resource

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
belongs to several companies,

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
is available to several companies,

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
a monopoly is formed,

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
not a monopoly,

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
but an oligopoly.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
The third

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
reason

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
of monopoly power

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
is the increasing

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
return on scale.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Here it is a little

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
more complicated.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Let's recall

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
what is

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
the increasing return

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
on scale.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
What does it mean?

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
When does it arise?

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
When do we talk

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
about the increasing return

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
on scale?

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
When

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
the growth,

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
the increase

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
of the number

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
of resources used

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
in N times,

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
the production increases

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
more than in N times.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
We talked about it

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
in the previous topic.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
But if there is

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
a place for the increasing

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
return on scale,

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
it means

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
that the more

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
the production,

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
the less the company

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
costs

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
per unit of production.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Think about it.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Let's say,

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
a company is twice as large

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
as a small one.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
It uses twice as much

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
labor and capital

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
as a small one.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
And the production

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
increases

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
three times.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
This means

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
that the production

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
costs per unit

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
will be less.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
So,

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
in this case,

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
the larger the volume

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
of production,

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
the less the production

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
costs per unit

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
of production.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
And if this is the case,

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
the companies

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
will start to increase.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Look at it.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
At the beginning

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
of the 20th century,

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
dozens of independent companies

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
operated on the car market

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
in the United States.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
What happened next?

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Let's say,

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
several companies

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
grew larger.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
The number of resources

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
increased

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
two times.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
And the production

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
increased four times.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
This means

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
that the larger companies

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
spent

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
less than

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
the production

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
costs.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
What does this mean?

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
The larger companies

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
grew larger,

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
the smaller companies

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
grew smaller.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
And so,

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
in the end,

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
only one company

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
will remain on the market.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
If there are several companies

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
on the market,

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
we are talking about

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
natural oligopoly.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Look at the definition

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
of natural monopoly.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Natural monopoly.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Natural monopoly

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
is a company

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
that can satisfy

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
any market demand

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
with small and short

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
and long-term

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
average costs

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
than those

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
that would be created

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
if there were two

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
or more companies

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
operating on the market

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
instead of it.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
What is the special feature

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
of natural monopoly?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
It is that its special

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
monopoly position

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
is not based

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
on an administrative resource,

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
nor on any other factors

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
that can be eliminated.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Its monopoly position

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
is based on

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
the principle

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
of property costs.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
And here is an important conclusion.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
It is pointless

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
to fight against natural monopoly

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
by enlarging it.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
If we

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
create two companies

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
instead of one

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
large company

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
that is a natural monopoly,

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
each of them

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
will have twice

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
less output

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
than a large company.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
And the costs

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
will be

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
one unit

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
more.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
I will try

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
to illustrate

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
natural monopoly

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
with a number of examples.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Here is the simplest example.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
In our houses

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
there are

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
two pipes

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
in the kitchen

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
one is hot

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
and the other is cold.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Water

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
is supplied by

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
one company

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Mosvodokanal.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
But in fact

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
monopoly is bad

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
most often.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
When monopoly

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
is usually high prices

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
it is usually

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
low quality.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Why then,

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
if monopoly is bad

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
why don't we

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
chase competition

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
and supply

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
many pipes

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
with hot and cold water

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
belonging to different companies?

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Then companies

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
could compete with each other

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
and we could choose

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
the water that is cheaper

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
or cleaner.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
It is not done

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
for a very simple reason.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
The costs for each liter of water

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
will increase.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Here is a very conventional example.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Let's say

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
water consumption

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
per unit of time

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
does not matter,

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
per year, per month, per day

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
is 100 liters.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
To supply a pipe

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
with water to an apartment

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
we need to spend 100 rubles.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
It turns out

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
that the costs

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
for one liter of water

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
will be 1 ruble.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Now imagine

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
that we are chasing competition

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and we supply

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
at least two pipes

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
that supply water

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
to different companies.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Two different companies

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
supply water to our homes.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But then

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
if two pipes

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
the costs for the water

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
will increase

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
by two times

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and will be 200 rubles in total.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And water consumption

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
in an apartment

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
will remain

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
it will not change

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
it will remain 100 liters.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And what will happen?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The costs

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
for each liter

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
will be 2 rubles.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
This means

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
that it is not profitable

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
to replace one pipe

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
with another.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It is not profitable

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
to create several companies

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
that compete with each other.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The costs for one liter

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
of water

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
will increase.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
This is a natural monopoly.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I repeat

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
a natural monopoly

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
is a company

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
whose monopoly

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
is based on the advantage

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
in costs.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
If we are in the order

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
of competing

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
instead of one company

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
we create several

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
the costs for one liter

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
will increase.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
We have just received this

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
in my conditional example.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Another example

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Raui S.Russia

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
This company

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
is engaged in many things.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It is engaged in the generation

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
of electricity

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
and the transmission of electricity

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
by lines of electricity

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and through its subsidiary companies

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
implementation.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Look,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
these are all

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
power plants

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
generating companies.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
This is a line of electricity.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And this is the sale of electricity

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
to consumers.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Which of these three spheres

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
of activity

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
of Raui S.Russia

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
is a natural monopoly?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Obviously,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
the line of electricity.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The main advantage

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
of this line

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
is that

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
the Raui S.Russia's own reform

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
provides for its liquidation

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
in its current form.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
From Raui S.Russia

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
will be allocated

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
as independent companies

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
wholesale generating companies

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and territorial generating companies.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Generation

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
can be

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
in the sphere of competition.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Generating companies

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
can compete with each other.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
There is no natural monopoly here.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But the line of electricity

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
should be the same.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Because if we

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
along with this line

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
will lay another one

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
for the sake of competition,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
the costs for the power plant

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
will increase

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
by exactly two times.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And, accordingly,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
the costs for each kilowatt hour

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
of transmission of electricity

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
will increase.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That is, the line of electricity

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
will be the same.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And after the reform

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
of Raui S.Russia

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
the line of electricity

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
will remain in the property

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
of the federal network company.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
This will be a natural monopoly

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
in which the control package of shares

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
belongs to the state.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Well, good.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And if we take the sphere

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
of Gazprom,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
what is there

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
to be?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Natural monopoly.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Obviously, gas pipelines.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Actually, the production of gas

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
can be done by independent companies.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
But the pipe

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
is not filled

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
to the end.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It is better if there is only one.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Otherwise, the costs for the gas transmission

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
will increase.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
In the sphere of Raui S.Russia

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
the Russian railway

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
is a natural monopoly.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Obviously,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
the railway infrastructure

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
and the railway carriages

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
can be private property

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
of independent

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
and competing

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
companies.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But they are not

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
natural monopolies.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Actually, this is what

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
the Russian railway

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
is.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Sooner or later

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
only the railway carriages

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and the infrastructure

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
will remain in the property

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
of Raui S.Russia.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
The rest will be the property

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
of independent companies

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
that will compete with each other.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
we have considered

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
different types

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
of existing market structures.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Let's move on

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
to the second question

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
of the second part.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
The first question is

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
whether the company's

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
revenue is

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
a total revenue.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
What does it mean?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It is very simple.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The company's revenue

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
is the product of

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
the product's price

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
multiplied by the volume

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
of the output.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
You can see the formula

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
on the slide.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
TR is equal to

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
the usual formula of the revenue.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Another term

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
is the average income

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
of the company.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
The average income

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
of the company

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
is the private

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
division of the revenue

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
by the volume of the output

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
or the implementation.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
it is not difficult to understand

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
that if the revenue

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
is divided by the volume of the output,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
the price will be obtained.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the average income

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
is just another

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
name for the price.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Graphically,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
how can we build

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
the function of the revenue?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
If we are dealing

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
with a completely

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
competitive company,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
what is its difference?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Remember,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
if the company's

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
revenue is zero,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
the price is set.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
The company cannot

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
change this price.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
This is why

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the function of the revenue

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
from the output

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
of a completely competitive company

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
is a linear function

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
that starts from the coordinates.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
If the revenue is zero

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
in the zero-output,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
the price is set

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
in the one-output.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
We get the output

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
multiplied by the set price

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
and so on.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Accordingly,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
the function of the revenue

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
will be linear.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
The next

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
very important

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
concept

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
in the microeconomics

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
is the marginal income.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Marginal revenue.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
The definition of the marginal income

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
is read on the slide.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The marginal income

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
is the increase

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
in the revenue

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
when the sales

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
are increased

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
by one unit.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
That is,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
MR is equal to

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
delta TR

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
divided by delta Q.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Doesn't marginal income

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
remind you of anything?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
What is the marginal income?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
It is something we studied

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
in the previous topic.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Remember, in the previous topic

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
we talked about marginal costs.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Let's recall.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Marginal costs

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
are the increase

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
in the total costs

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
when the sales

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
are increased by one unit.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And the marginal income

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
is the increase

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
in the revenue

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
when the sales

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
are increased

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
by one unit.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Accordingly,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
the marginal income

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
is the additional income

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
that the company gets

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
when the additional units

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
of the product

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
are produced and sold.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Take a look.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The simplest example

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
of the calculation

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
of the marginal income

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
is shown on the slide.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Yes,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
just a small remark.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
While we are talking

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
about a completely competitive company,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
its marginal income

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
is equal to the price of the product.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
In fact,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
a completely competitive company

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
sells any amount

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
of its product

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
at the market price.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
The price for a completely competitive company

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
is the given price.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And if this is true,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
then each additional unit

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
of the product

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
brings the company

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
additional revenue,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
additional income

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
equal to this price.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
If, for example,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
the company sells

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
a product at the price of 10 rubles,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
each additional unit

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
of the product

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
will increase

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
the company's revenue

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
by 10 rubles.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Thus, the company's marginal income

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
is equal to the price

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
of the product

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
it sells.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And now,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
please look at the table

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
on the slide.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You see,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
the company's output changes

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
in the first column.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I change it here

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
from 0 to 5.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The price, as we have already said,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
for a completely competitive company

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
is constant,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
let's say 10 rubles.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
By multiplying the price

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
by the volume of sales,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I get

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
the company's revenue.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It changes

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
with the change in the output.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And you see,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
it changes linearly

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
as we have just said.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
What is the marginal income equal to?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Let's calculate.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
What is the marginal income?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It is the delta of the revenue,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
that is, the return on the revenue

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
divided by the return on the revenue.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
The return on the revenue

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
is always 1,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
and the return on the revenue

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
is always 10.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
That is,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
the marginal income

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
is equal to

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
the price of the product

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
for a completely competitive company.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I repeat,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
for a monopoly.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
We will talk about it later.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Let's move on

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
to the third question.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
The balance

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
of a completely competitive company.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Here we assume

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
that the company

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
strives

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
to maximize

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
its profit.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
What is a profit?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It is very simple.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Look at the slide.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
A profit

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
is the difference

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
between the company's revenue

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
and its total profit.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
That is,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
the profit is equal to

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
the revenue

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
minus the total

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
cost.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I repeat,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
the company wants

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
to maximize

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
this difference,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
that is, the profit.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Theoretically,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
the problem is solved very simply.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
The company's profit

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
is maximized

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
by the total

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
cost.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
How to explain it?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Look.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
My company

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
is engaged

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
in the production

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
of a product

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
or a service.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Let's say

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I increase

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
the total

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
cost

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
by a fraction.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I increase

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
the total

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
cost

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
by one more fraction.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I get

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
additional income

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
or in our terms

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
the maximum income.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
That's good.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
But at the same time

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I will have to bear

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
additional costs.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
That's bad.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Nevertheless,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
if the additional income,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
that is, the maximum income,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
is higher than the additional costs,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
that is, the maximum costs,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
then the additional

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
unit of the production

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
will increase

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
the profit

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
of my company.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And while

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
the maximum income

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
exceeds the maximum costs,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
the increase

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
of the production

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
leads to the increase

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
of the profit.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
The total profit

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
of the company

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
is increased

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
by all units of production.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
So,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
as soon as the maximum income

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
is equal to the maximum costs,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
the additional unit

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
of production

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
stops increasing

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
the total profit

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
of the company.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And the total profit

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
has reached

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
the maximum.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
So,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
the profit of a completely

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
competitive company

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
at such a volume of production

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
is equal to

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
its maximum costs.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Let's,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
to make it clearer,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
look at

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
a conditional numerical example.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Let's say,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
we have a company

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
that is producing

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
a certain amount of goods.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Let's look at

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
a conditional numerical example.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Here,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
please,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
look at the table.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
In the first column,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
there are changes in production

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
from 0 to 10.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
In the second column,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
there are constant costs.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Well, the constant costs

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
do not change

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
by definition,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
they do not depend on production.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
The variable costs

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
are shown

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
as variable costs

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
change with the change in production.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
These values

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
are given initially.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
All other values,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
at least in terms of costs,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
are calculated.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Knowing the constant

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
and variable costs,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
we can calculate

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
the total costs.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
We can calculate

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
the average constant costs,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
the average variable costs,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
and the average total costs.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I hope you remember the formulas.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And finally,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
in the next column,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
we have

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the maximum costs.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
How do we get

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
the maximum costs?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Look again.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I remind you,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
the maximum costs

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
are the addition

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
of the total costs

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
when the output

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
is 1.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
The output always increases

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
by 1.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I divide the addition

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
of the total costs

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
by 1 when the output is 1.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
when the output

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
goes from 0 to 1,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
the total costs

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
increase by 32 rubles.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
These are the maximum costs.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
These are the additional costs

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
that we will have to bear

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
if we want to increase

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
the output

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
from 0 to 1.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Then,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
we increase the output

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
by 1,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
from 1 to 2.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
How much do the total costs increase?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
By 20 units.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
These are the maximum costs

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
when the output

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
goes from 1 to 2.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And so on.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Please note

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
that the maximum costs

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
decrease at first,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
then reach the minimum.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Do you see the minimum?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
At the output of 4 units,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
the maximum costs

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
become minimal.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And then the maximum costs

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
begin to increase.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
That is, we deal

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
with the classic

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
U-shaped curve

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
of the maximum costs

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
that we have already discussed

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
in the previous topic.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
The next column

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
is the price.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But if the company

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
is completely competitive,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
then, as I have said many times,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
the maximum income

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
of such a company

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
is always equal to the price

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
of the product

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I have set the price,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
the price is 30,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
the maximum income

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
of a completely competitive company

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
is always constant

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
and equal to the price.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Now look carefully

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
at the table.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
We increase

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
the output all the time.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
And so,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
starting

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
from 2 units of the output,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
the maximum income

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
or price

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
exceeds the maximum costs.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
For example,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
at the output of 3 units

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
the maximum income

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
is equal to

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
30,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
and the maximum costs

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
are equal to

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
12.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
What does this mean?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
That if we release

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
the third unit of the product,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
our profit

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
will increase.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
In fact,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
look at the last column.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
The profit in this zone

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
is still negative,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
but

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
when the output is increased,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
the negative profit

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
begins to decrease.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
That is, the profit increases.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And look,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
at the output of 5 units,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
we already get

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
a positive profit.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
It is equal to 8.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Nevertheless,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
at this output

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
we will not stop.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Why?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Because if we release

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
the sixth unit of the product,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
the maximum income is equal to

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
30,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
and the maximum costs

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
are equal to 18.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
That is, the sixth unit of the product

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
will require 18 rubles

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
of additional costs,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
but will bring 30 rubles

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
of additional income.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
So,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
how much will the profit increase?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
By 12 rubles.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And in fact,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
at the output of 5 units

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
the profit was 8,

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
and at the output of 6 units

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
it is already equal to 20.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
So, the profit increased

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
by 12 rubles.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Let's look further.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
At the output of 7 units,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
what do we see?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
The maximum income is 30,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
the maximum costs are 24.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
So, the additional unit

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
of the product

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
increases our profit

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
by 6 rubles.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
That's how it happened.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
The profit increased by 6 rubles

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
and reached 26 rubles.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And when does the profit become maximum?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
It becomes maximum,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
strictly speaking,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
at the moment

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
when the maximum income

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
is equal to the maximum costs.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Look,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
at the output of 8 units

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
the maximum income

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
is 30,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
the maximum costs are also 30.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
They were equal to each other.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
This means

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
that the profit stopped increasing.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
If at the output of 8 units

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
the maximum income

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
was at least a penny more

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
than the maximum costs,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
this additional unit

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
of the product

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
would increase

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
our profit.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
So, as soon as

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
the maximum income

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
was equal to the maximum costs,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
the profit reached its maximum.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But the 9th unit of the product

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
is useless to be produced.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Why?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
What is the maximum income

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
of the 9th unit of the product?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
30, as always.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And what is the maximum costs?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
40.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
So, the 9th unit of the product

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
will reduce our total profit

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
by 10 rubles.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
This is how it happened.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
The total profit

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
at the 9th unit of the product

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
is only 16.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
That is,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
the maximum point has been reached.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
That is,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
at the output of 8 units

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
the company is in a state of equilibrium.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It is not profitable

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
to reduce its output

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
or increase its profit.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
And now let's look

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
at the same thing,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
but on the graph.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Look carefully,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
without hurrying,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
at what is depicted

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
on this graph.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
All these graphs

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
could be obtained

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
if we

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
started to transfer

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
to the graph

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
the total profit

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
at the 9th unit of the product.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
We started to transfer

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
the figures from the previous table

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
to the graph.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
In fact,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
you see the price line.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It goes horizontally

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
parallel

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
to the x-axis,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
the output axis.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
The price is set.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
It does not change

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
with the change

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
of the output.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
The output changes,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
the price is constant.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And the maximum profit,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
as we have already said,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
is equal to the price.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
In my example,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
the price was equal to 30 rubles.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And it does not change.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It does not change.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Look again

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
at the function of the maximum costs.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
What do the maximum costs do?

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
First they decrease,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
then they start

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
to increase.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
This is reflected in the graph.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You see, the function of the maximum costs

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
first decreases,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
then at some volume of the output

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
it reaches the minimum,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
then it starts to increase.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
You see, the function of the MC.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Now look at the function

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
of the AC.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
What is the AC?

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
This function

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
of the average total costs.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
What is it?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Let's go back to the table.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Look at this function.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
This is how it is.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
It first decreases

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
with the increase of the output

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
the average total costs of AC.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Then,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
at the output of 7,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
as you can see,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
it reaches the minimum,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and then the average total costs

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
of the AC

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
decrease.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And the maximum costs

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
start to increase

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
as reflected in our graph.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
In this graph

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
you can see

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
several critical points.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
The first point

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
corresponds to the output

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Q1.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Look at the function

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
of the MC.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
What do we observe

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
at the interval

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
from 0 to Q1?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
At this interval

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
the maximum costs

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
look carefully

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
exceed

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
the price of the product

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
or the maximum income of the company.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
So, at this interval

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
the losses of the company

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
only increase.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
This is how it is.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
You see,

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
at the output

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
from 0 to 1

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
the maximum costs

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
are greater than the maximum income.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Accordingly,

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
at the output of 1

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
the losses of the company

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
are negative.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
The losses are the biggest.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Let's look further

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
at the graph.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
What do we observe

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
at the interval

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
from Q1 to Q2?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
At this interval

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
the maximum income

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
is greater than the maximum costs.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
This means

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
that each additional unit

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
of the output

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
already increases

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
our profit.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
But the total profit

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
remains negative

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
due to the load of the past losses.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And what do we observe

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
at the output of Q2?

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
At this Q2 output

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
the price of the product

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
becomes equal

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
to the average total costs.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Do you see this?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
At the Q2 output

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
the price is equal

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
to the average total costs.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
But if the price

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
is equal to the average costs

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and the average costs

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
are the costs

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
per unit of the output,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
if the price is equal

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
to the costs per unit of the output,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
then the profit becomes

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
equal to 0.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Therefore,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
the Q2 output

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
corresponds to

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
the point of no loss.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
At the Q2 output

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
the profit of the company

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
is equal to 0.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
At the Q2 output

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
the company

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
is in the loss zone.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
It is in the loss zone.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And only when the Q2 output

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
is reached

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
the company

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
reduces the costs.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
That is,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
it reaches the point of no loss.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
If the loss is less,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
we are doomed to loss.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
If we reach the Q2 output,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
the company reaches this output,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
the loss is equal to 0,

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
but the profit is equal to 0,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
we find ourselves in the point of no loss.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
What does

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
the further increase

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
of the output

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
lead to?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
The price

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
is higher

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
than the average

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
total costs.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
That is,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
with each unit of the output

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
we get more money

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
than the costs per unit of the output.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
So, we find ourselves

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
in the profit zone.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And look,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
the price

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
is always

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
higher than the average costs.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
So,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
the more

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
we produce,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
the more

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
our profit is.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
The more our profit is.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
And where does

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
the maximum profit

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
occur?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
It occurs

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
at the point

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
where

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
the company's maximum costs

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
become equal

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
to the price.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
That is,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
at Q3 output

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
the company receives

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
the maximum

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
total profit.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Good.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And if we increase

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
the output,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
the over-output Q3,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
what do we get?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
What do we see?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
The maximum costs

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
are already higher

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
than the price.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
And this means

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
that the maximum profit is achieved.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
The maximum profit is achieved.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And the profit

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
is already decreasing.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
The point of equilibrium

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
of the completely competitive company

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
is Q3.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
At this output

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
the company receives

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
the maximum profit.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
If the company increases

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
the output,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
in the interval

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Q3 to Q4

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
the profit is still positive,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
but the maximum is achieved.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
And at the output

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
equal to Q4,

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
what do we see?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
The price of the product

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
again becomes equal

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
to the average cost

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
or the cost per unit of production.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
But if the price is equal to the cost per unit of production,

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
the total profit becomes

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
equal to

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
the second point of non-profitability.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
But if we continue to insist

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and continue to increase the output,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
the profit will become negative

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and we will again

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
fall into the zone

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
of non-profitability.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Let's now

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
complicate the situation a little.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Imagine

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
what a terrible thing has happened.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I told you

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
that the completely competitive company

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
does not have

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
control over the price.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Regardless of the will of the company,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
the market price

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
has fallen.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And now it is

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
look at the table

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
on the new slide.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Now the market price

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
is 24 rubles.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
All other data

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
concerning the costs

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
remain the same.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
What does this mean now?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Look carefully

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
at the last column.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
At the last column.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
At such a low price,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
the company is doomed

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
to losses

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
at any volume of production.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
No matter what production

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
the company will suffer

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
from losses.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
What can the company do

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
in such conditions?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
It can

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
only minimize

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
the losses.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
The maximum profit

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
in this case

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
means the minimum

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
loss.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
But the rule remains the same.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
The maximum profit

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
is achieved

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
when the maximum income

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
is equal to the maximum costs.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Look at

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Look at the 8th

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
and 9th columns.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
In the 8th column

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
we have

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
the maximum costs.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
In the 9th column

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
the maximum income

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
is equal to the price.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And where are

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
the maximum costs

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
equal to the maximum income?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
At the 7th volume.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And look at this.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
At this volume

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
the company's profit

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
is the maximum

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
in the sense

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
that the loss is minimal.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I repeat,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
the maximum profit in this case

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
means the minimum loss.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
The loss is minimal

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
at the 7th volume.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
But here

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
the main question arises.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
You see,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
the company cannot avoid losses.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
At such a low price.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
It can only minimize

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
the loss.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Maybe we should just stop?

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Stop production and that's it?

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
We cannot avoid losses.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Let's shut down.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Let's stop the production.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
If the product is lossy,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
let's stop production.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
And that's it.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
In fact,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
it will be a bad decision.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Why?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Let's recall

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
the theory of costs.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
In a short period

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
there are constant costs

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
that cannot be avoided.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Even if the company shuts down,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
that is, the production will be equal to zero,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
there are constant costs

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
that will have to be incurred.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
What are the constant costs equal to?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
They are equal to

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
the second column, look,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
60.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
So if the company shuts down,

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
it will lose its revenue.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It does not produce anything,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
it does not sell anything.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
The revenue will be equal to zero.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
It will save money, of course,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
on variable costs.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
With zero production,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
variable costs are also equal to zero.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
But constant costs

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
will still have to be incurred.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
And this means

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
that the loss of the company will be greater.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And if we shut down,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
the loss of the company

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
will be equal to constant costs.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
This is reflected

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
in the last column.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
With zero production,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
the company's profit is minus 60.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
That is, the company is losing

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
in the amount of 60 rubles,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
and this loss is exactly equal

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
to constant costs.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Well, if

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
this is still not very clear,

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I will try to give

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
such a practical example.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Well, you probably know

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
that now

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
our country is buying in oil dollars.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Oil prices of our Urals brand

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
exceed 60 dollars per barrel.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Now it's hard to believe,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
but in 1998

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
the average annual price

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
of our oil,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
the world price,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
was about 11 dollars per barrel.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
At such a low price,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
many of our oil companies

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
were making losses.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
But nevertheless,

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
they did not close.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
And this is the reason

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
why we are in a crisis.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Why?

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Because

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
in a short period

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
there are constant costs,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
which are impossible

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
to avoid.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And if our oil companies

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
did not close,

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
they would stop pumping oil.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
They would lose their profits,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
save on variable costs,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
but the oil companies

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
have a large volume

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
of costs,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
which they have to bear

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
regardless of whether

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
they produce something

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
or not.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Therefore, in this case

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
there would be even more losses.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
This is reflected

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
in my conditional numerical example.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Well, I tried to

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
depict the same

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
on a drawing.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Look at the following slide.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
What is the optimal output?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Let's go back

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
to the previous slide.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
The optimal output

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
is 7.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
At the output of 7

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
the loss of the company

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
is minimal,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
that is, the profit is maximum

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
as far as possible.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
What is the revenue

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
at this volume of output?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
168.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
What are the total costs

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
at this volume of output?

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
At the output of 7?

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Look.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
The TC column,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
total costs,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
184.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And what do we observe?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
That our total costs,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
as I said,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
exceed the revenue.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
We are incurring losses.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And what are the variable costs

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
at the output of 7?

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
124.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
What do we observe?

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
That the revenue

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
does not cover the total costs.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
This is true.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
But it covers the variable costs

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
and partially covers the constant costs.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Look at the drawing.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
What is our revenue

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
at the optimal output?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
168.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
The total costs are 184.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
The variable costs are 124.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
And the constant costs are 60.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
But they are always 60.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
So we see

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
that the revenue covers

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
the variable costs

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and partially covers the constant costs.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
If we would have rolled the output,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
we would have lost the revenue

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
and saved on the variable costs

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
and incurred even more losses

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
in the amount

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
of all the constant costs.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
But when will the company

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
leave the market

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
even in a short period?

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Here is when.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Look at the next slide.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
When the price

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
falls to such a low level

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
that the revenue

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
at the optimal output

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
does not cover

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
even the variable costs.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
There is no point

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
in staying in the market

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
and continuing to produce

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
in a short period.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
We need to stop the output.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
We will lose the revenue

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
but save on the variable costs

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and incur even more losses

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
and the loss will be less

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
than if we stay in the market.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Now I am trying

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
to show all this

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
on the graphs.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Look.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
The functions of the costs are traditional.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Everything is as it was.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
There is nothing new here.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Let's say

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
the price

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
is equal to

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
P1

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
at the beginning.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
What output does the company choose?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Q1.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Why Q1?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Because we remember the rule

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
that the profit of the company

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
is the maximum

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
at such an output

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
that the price

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
or the maximum income

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
is equal to the maximum costs.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
The price is equal to the maximum costs.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Imagine that

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
regardless of the will of the company

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
the competitive company

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
does not affect the price

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
as we said.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
The price falls to the level of P2.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Where is the output

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
with the maximum income?

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
It is always the maximum income

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
at such an output

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
with the price

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
equal to the maximum costs.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Where is this intersection point?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
The point is now E2

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
and the output is Q2.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
The price is equal to the maximum costs.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Where is the intersection point?

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
The point is now E2

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
and the output is Q2.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
But at this output

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
the company

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
does not get

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
any economic profit

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
at this price

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
and at this output.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
At this output

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
it is better to say

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000
at Q2

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
the price is equal to

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
not only the maximum costs

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
but also the average total costs.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Look carefully.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Do you see the line of the average total costs?

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
The line is AC.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
The function AC

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
decreases and then reaches the minimum

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
at the point E2.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
At the price of P2

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
the company

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
does not get any profit

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
at this price.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
The economic profit is zero.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
And if the price falls to P3

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
what do we see now?

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
At any volume of the output

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
the price is lower than the average costs.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
The cost is lower than the unit of production.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
So, losses are inevitable.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
But nevertheless

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
to minimize the losses

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
the company chooses the output

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
always

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
at the price of P3

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
where the price of P3

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
is equal to the maximum costs.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
This is Q3.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
The company

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
is losing.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It is minimizing the losses

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
at this point.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
But pay attention

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
to what is important.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
At the price

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
of Q3

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
the price

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
is higher than

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
the average costs.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Pay attention.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
At the price of Q3

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
the price is always P3

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
and the function of the average costs

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
of A, B, C

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
is lower.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
This means

01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000
that if the price of Q3

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
is lower than the average costs

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
of A

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
then the company

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
partially covers

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
the variable costs

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
and partially covers the constant costs.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
It is better to stay in the market.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
This is what I told you earlier.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But if the price

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
falls below the level of P4

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
look what happens.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
If the price

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
falls below the level of P4

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
the price will be

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
lower

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.000
than the minimum

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
of the average variable costs.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
In this case

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
the company must close

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000
in a short period

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
because the revenue

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
will not cover

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
not only the constant

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
but also the variable costs.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And the further continuation

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
of production

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
will lead only to losses.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Therefore

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
the point E4

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
is called

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
the minimum

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
of the average variable costs.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
If the price

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
falls below

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
the revenue

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
will not cover

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
the variable costs.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
It is necessary to close.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
But I repeat

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
this is the theory

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
of the equilibrium of the company

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
in a short period.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I want to repeat

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
that if the price

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000
falls below the level of P3

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
the company will lose money.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
But in a short period

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
the company will remain in the market.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Otherwise the losses

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
will be even greater

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
because there are constant costs

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
that cannot be avoided

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
in a short period.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
What is the difference

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
between a long period

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
and a short period?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
In a long period

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
all costs

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
can be re-examined.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
For example

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
in a short period

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
we cannot re-examine

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
the lease agreement

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
because the lease payment

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
is a constant cost.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
The lease payment is based on the agreement

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
and we cannot avoid it.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000
But in a long period

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000
we can refuse

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000
the lease agreement

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
re-examine it

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
change the lease agreement

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
and try to optimize the costs.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Therefore

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
in a long period

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
the company will lose money

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
from the market

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
if it cannot

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
change the costs

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
for example

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
to conclude

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
a more profitable lease agreement.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Let's move

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
to the fourth question.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Before we started

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
we talked about

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
the balance

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
of a completely competitive company.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
And now

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
we will talk

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
about how the balance

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
of a company

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
with monopoly power

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
is achieved.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Let me remind you

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
a company with monopoly power

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
can be in the well-known

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
markets

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
and can manage

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
the price.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
It can set

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
a higher price

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
but then it will face

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
a drop in demand.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
It can set a lower price

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
but the demand for its products will increase.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
So what is the task of a monopolist?

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
A monopolist is

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
a price maker

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
a price finder.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
His task

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
is to set

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
such a price

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
and choose such a volume

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
of the product

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
with which

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
its profit will be

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
maximum.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
The general rule

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
of profit maximization

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.000
is that the profit is maximum

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
when the maximum income

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
is equal to the maximum costs.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
This is a universal rule.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
It is true for any company

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
even if it is completely competitive

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
even if it has monopolies

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
even if it has oligopolies

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
or anyone else.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
The profit of any company

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
is maximum

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
when

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
its maximum income

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
is equal to the maximum costs

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
with such a volume of the product.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Here a monopolist does not have to

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
bring anything new

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
in comparison with a completely competitive company.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
But there is an important difference.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Remember I said

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
that a completely competitive company

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
has an absolute income

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
equal to the price of the product.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000
A monopolist has nothing like that.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000
The absolute income of a monopolist

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
is always less than the price

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
at which

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
the monopolist

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
sells his product.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
We need to figure this out.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Let's take

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
the simplest

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
conditional function

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
of the demand for the product

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
of a monopolist.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
The demand

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
for the product

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
of a monopolist

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
is

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
p

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
minus q.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
p is equal to

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
10 minus q.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
p is the price

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
and q is the demand.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
And what do we see?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
The higher the price

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
the lower the demand.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Here is

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
the function

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
and the data

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
taken from it

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I have transferred to the table.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Please look at the slide.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
You see

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
at the price

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
of 10

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
let's say

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
we put 10 here

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
the demand value will be

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
0.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Is it correct?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
The demand value

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
will be 1.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
And so on.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
The first line

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
contains all possible prices

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
for the product of a monopolist

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
from 10 to 0.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
The second line contains

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
all possible values of the demand

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
at a given price.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Is it clear?

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
The third line

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
contains

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
the income

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
of a monopolist

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
from 10 to 0.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I hope you remember

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
that the income is

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
the product

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
of the price

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
at the demand value.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
So,

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
at the price of 0

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
we cannot sell

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
a single unit of the product

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000
so the income is 0.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
At the price of 9

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
we can sell a single unit

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
of the product

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
of a monopolist

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
but we should remember

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
that a monopoly cannot cancel

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
the demand value.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Whatever monopolist I am

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000
at a given price

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
the demand for my product

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
will be 0.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Well,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
what do we see?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
The income

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000
increases

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000
at the price of 5

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
and reaches

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
the maximum

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
at the price of 25.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And then the income

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
starts to decrease.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Now let's calculate

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
the maximum income

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000
of a monopolist.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
You surely remember

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000
the formula of the maximum income.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
The maximum income

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
is the increase

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
of the revenue

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
divided by

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
the increase of the product.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
And look,

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
the income

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
is the increase

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
of the revenue

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
divided by

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
the increase

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
of the product.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And look,

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
at first we set

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
the price of 10

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
and nobody bought anything.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Then we set the price of 9

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
and bought a single unit of the product.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
The income increased

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
to what?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
From 0 to 9,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
that is 9.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Delta TR is 9.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Delta TR is 1.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
So the maximum income

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
is 9.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
But in this case

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
the maximum income

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000
would be better

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
and more correct

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000
to set not under 1,

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
not under TR1,

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
look at the slide,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
but when we switch

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
from TR0 to TR1.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000
That is,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
the increase of the revenue

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
when the product is increased

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
from 0 to 1.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Let's look further.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
At the time of the product 1

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
we have the revenue of 9,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
and at the time of the product 2

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
we have 16.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.000
So when the product is increased

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
by 1 unit

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
from 1 to 2,

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
the revenue increases

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
from 9 to 16,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
that is 7.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
And the maximum income

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
when the product 1

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000
is increased from 1 to 2

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
is 7,

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
and so on.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Thus, I have filled

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
the last line

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
which contains the data

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
about the change

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000
of the maximum income.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Good.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And now

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
let's set

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
any volume of the issue

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
from the numbers

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
that are given

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
on our slide.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Let's say,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
issue 3.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
What price should we set

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
to sell 3 units of the product?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Look at the first line.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
To sell 3 units of the product

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
the monopolist should set

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.000
the price of 7.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
And what is the maximum income

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
at issue 3?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Look at the last line.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000
It is between 5 and 3.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000
We can prove mathematically

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000
that at issue 3

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
the maximum income

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000
will be 7.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000
And what is the maximum income

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000
at issue 3?

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
The maximum income

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
will be 4.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Thus, at issue 3

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
the price is 7

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000
and the maximum income

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
of the monopolist is 4.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
The maximum income

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000
of the monopolist

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000
is less than the price.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Good.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Let's set another volume of the issue.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Let's say,

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
it will be 5.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
What is the price

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
of 5 units of the product?

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000
The price is 5.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
And what is the maximum income

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
at issue 5?

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Look at the last line.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000
It is between 1 and negative 1.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000
We can prove mathematically

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000
that at issue 5

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000
the maximum income

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
is 0.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
And again,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000
the price is greater than

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
the maximum income.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.000
What am I trying to say?

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I am trying to explain

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
that the maximum income

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
of the monopolist

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
was always equal

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.000
to the price of the product.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
And the monopolist's

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
maximum income

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
at any volume of the issue

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
is less than the price of the product.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I strongly suspect

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
that my explanation

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
is not correct.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I am not sure

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
that I am making a mistake.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
I am not sure

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
that I am making a mistake.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I am not sure

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
that I am making a mistake.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
It is a mathematical error.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I am making mistakes

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
with the numbers.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000
You can't deny the numbers.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
But I would like you

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000
to understand

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
why this is so.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
The monopoly with its maximum income

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
always has a lower price

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000
than the price of the product.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
What is the problem?

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Let's take this example.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Let's try this.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
This is a conditional example.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I am a monopolist

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000
in selling beer

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
in this city.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I am the only one who sells beer.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I don't let anyone else

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
to this market.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I am the only seller.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I am the only one who sells beer.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
The function of the demand for beer

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
is given here.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
If I am a monopolist soon,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I start to play with the price.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000
On the first day of the sale

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I set the price

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
of 10 rubles for a bottle of beer.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
How much beer did I buy?

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Look at the table.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Zero.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000
No one buyer came to me

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000
at this price.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
The price is too high.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I start to reduce the price.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
There is no place to hide.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
The next day

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I set the price of 9 rubles.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
How much beer did I buy?

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
One bottle.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Who came to me?

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Either the richest person

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
or the biggest beer lover

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
in this city.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000
At the price of 9 rubles

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I sold one bottle.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Let's say I am not satisfied with this.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
The next day

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I set the price of 8 rubles

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
for a bottle of beer.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
The one who bought

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
9 rubles

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
will buy 8 rubles more

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
with even more pleasure.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
But who will come to me?

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
The second beer lover will come

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
for whom the price of 9 rubles

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
was too high

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
and 8 rubles was just right.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
So,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000
what happens?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000
At the price of 8 rubles

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I sold 2 bottles.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Now tell me, please,

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
how much money

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000
did the second beer lover

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
bring me today?

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
The additional money

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
that he didn't bring me yesterday.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Yesterday he didn't bring me anything.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Today he bought

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
8 rubles worth of beer.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
So, I got

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
additional 8 rubles

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
that I didn't get yesterday.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
This is good.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
What's bad?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I lost 1 ruble

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
to the first buyer.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Yesterday he bought me 9 rubles worth.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
And now the price is the same for everyone.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000
The price is always the same.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
At least in my case.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
The price is the same for everyone.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
So,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
the second buyer brought me

02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000
8 rubles worth of beer.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000
And at the first buyer I lost 1 ruble.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
So,

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
the increase in the profit

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.000
was not due to the price.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Now the price is 8 rubles.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
And the maximum income is only 7 rubles.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Is it clear

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000
why the maximum income

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000
is lower than the price?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Why is the income lower than the price?

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Because when we reduce the price,

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
we lose

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
to those buyers

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
who could buy the goods

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
at a higher price.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
At a higher price.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Once again.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
At the second buyer I won 8 rubles.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
He brought me 8 rubles worth

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
that he didn't bring me yesterday.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
But the first buyer brought me 9 rubles worth yesterday.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
And today he brought me only 8 rubles.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
I sell beer at 8 rubles.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
So, at the first buyer I lost 1 ruble.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
At the second buyer I won 8 rubles.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000
The maximum income is only 7 rubles.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
The price is higher than the maximum income.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
And we can prove

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I'm not using high math.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
I'm just trying to explain it with my fingers.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
We can prove

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
that if the demand function is linear,

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
the minimum income function

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
is also linear

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
and its slope

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
is twice as big

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
as the slope of the demand function.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
If the demand function is linear,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000
the minimum income function

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000
is also linear,

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
it is written on the slide,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000
and its slope

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
is twice as big as the slope

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
of the demand curve.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
So, we can see it.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Do you see the demand function?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Do you see the minimum income function?

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
The minimum income function

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
is twice as steep

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
as the demand function.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Its slope is twice as big.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Now let's see

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
how we can show

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
the achievement of monopole equilibrium

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
on the graph.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
What do we see here?

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
The linear function is linear

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
and the demand function is linear.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
On the other hand,

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
we see the minimum income function.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
The minimum income function

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
has twice as much slope

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.000
as the demand function

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
for the monopole product.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I also put the functions

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
of the minimum and average income

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000
of the monopolist

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
on this graph.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I'm sorry,

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
the minimum costs of the monopolist

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
and the average costs of the monopolist

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
are the same.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
The minimum costs of the monopolist

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
and the average costs of the monopolist

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
are the same.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000
I've already said

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
that there is only one rule.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
The maximum income

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
of such a product

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
with the minimum income

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000
is equal to the minimum costs.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Now look at the graph

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
where the functions

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
of the minimum income

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
and the minimum costs

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.000
intersect.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Do you see the intersection point?

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
This point determines the QM output

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
with which

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
the profit of the monopolist

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
is the maximum.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
And what is the price

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
that the monopolist

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
sets?

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
This price

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
must be found

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
on the demand curve.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Look.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
We restore the perpendicular

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
from the QM point

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
up to the intersection

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
with the demand function.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
And from there we lower the perpendicular

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
to the Y-axis,

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
to the price axis.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
So,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
in order to sell

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
the QM product

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
the monopolist

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
must set the price

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
PM for his product.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
With such a price

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
and such a volume

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
of production and sale

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
the profit of the monopolist

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
becomes the maximum.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And now,

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
can you show

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
the profit,

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
the amount

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
of the monopoly profit

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
in the market?

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Look.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
What is the profit?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
It's easy.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000
The profit is the difference

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
between the profit

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
and the total costs.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
What is the profit?

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
It is the price

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
multiplied

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
by the volume of sales.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
So,

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
the profit is the sum

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
of the total costs

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
multiplied by the QM.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
The graphical area

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
is the area

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
of the rectangle

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
OPMEQM.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.000
And where are the total costs?

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
The total costs

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
can be calculated

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
by multiplying

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
the average total costs

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
by the volume of production.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
If so,

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
then the average

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
and the total costs

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000
are equal to the area

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
of the rectangle

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
OCFQM.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
That is, it is the area

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
of the lower rectangle.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
And how do we get the profit?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
From the area of the upper rectangle

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
we calculate the area

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
of the lower rectangle.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
The area of the lower rectangle

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
is the area

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
of the rectangle

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
CPMEF.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000
And here is a very important conclusion

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
that follows.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Let's recall the perfect competition.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
In the case of perfect competition,

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
the price

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
at which the company

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
sells its products

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
becomes equal

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
to the equilibrium point

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
of the company

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
by its maximum costs.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
There is an equality.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
P is equal to MC.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
And in the monopoly rule,

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
the price

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
is higher

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
than the maximum costs.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
You see,

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000
the demand line

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
passes above

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
the maximum costs curve.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000
The maximum costs

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
of the monopolist

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000
at the QM release

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
are equal to the OCFQM.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
And the price of the monopolist

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000
is equal to

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000
the MCFQM.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
And the price of the monopolist

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
at the price the monopolist set

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
is equal to

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
the OCFQM.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
So, once again,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
the monopolist sets a price

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
that exceeds the maximum costs.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
And here is an important conclusion

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
that monopolies

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
are able

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
to increase

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000
the price

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
and reduce the volume of the release.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
In the conditions

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000
of monopoly rule,

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.000
the price is higher

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000
and the release is lower

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
than in the conditions

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
of competition.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
This is the main

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
claim of the society

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
to monopolies.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Monopolies

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
increase the price

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
and reduce the volume of the release

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
compared to the volume of the release

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
that would have been

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
if there was competition

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000
instead of monopolies.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
This is the main reason

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
for the anti-monopoly policy.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Anti-monopoly policy

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
is a policy

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
of supporting competition.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.000
In the West,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
anti-monopoly policy

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.000
has been

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
in force

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
for more than

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000
100 years.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000
The first anti-monopoly law

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000
in the USA

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000
was adopted

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000
in the 90s

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
of the 19th century.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
In Russia,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
it was adopted

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
100 years later.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
The text of this lecture

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000
tells in detail

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000
about anti-monopoly policy

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000
and its application

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000
to this course.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I will say

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
just two words.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Anti-monopoly policy

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
is a policy

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
of supporting competition.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
This is the direction

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
it is heading.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
In Russia,

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
a new anti-monopoly law

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
was adopted

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
in 2006.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
This law

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000
protects competition.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
This law is very useful.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000
It contains many interesting

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000
and new positions

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
aimed at

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000
preventing monopoly domination

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000
in the markets.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000
On the other hand,

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
our policy in Russia,

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
the policy of the Russian government

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
in this sense

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
is at least ambiguous.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
On the one hand,

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000
a very useful

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000
anti-monopoly law

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
is adopted.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
On the other hand,

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
new and new

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
large companies

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
are created

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
under the government's control.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
These are so-called

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000
national champions.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000
On the one hand,

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
we are fighting

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
against monopolies.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
On the other hand,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000
we are developing monopolies.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000
The Russian defense industry

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
is expanding its orbit.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
New and new enterprises

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
are creating holdings

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000
under the government's

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
control.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000
The same thing

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
is happening in the aviation industry.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
I will repeat it again.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
You will read about it

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
in the text of the lecture.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I would like to

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
express the doubts

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
in the effectiveness

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
of such a policy.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Most foreign experts

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
and domestic experts

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
believe

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
that the policy

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
of state support

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
of large companies

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.000
will lead only to

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000
the fact that

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.000
these companies

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000
will become ineffective.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
State support

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
and the absence of competition

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
will kill the business.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000
You will read about it

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
in the text of the lecture.
