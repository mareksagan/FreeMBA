WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, dear colleagues. My name is Irina Alexandrovna Evgenievna.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
I am a Doctor of Technical Sciences, certified business coach,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
partner of the training company ZGroup.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
I have practical experience of working on the implementation of the project

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
of the introduction of electronic systems of operational management of companies.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
When it comes to the construction of an organizational structure,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
the phrase of Mark Twain comes to mind.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
There is nothing easier than to quit smoking. I did it hundreds of times.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
The same story happens with organizational structures.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Almost every manager has crossed the structure of his organization many times,

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
and, putting his hand on his heart, he could admit that the ideal working structure

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
never worked out.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
There were always structural conflicts between managers of the same level.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
There were always problems in the interaction of structural units.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
There was always a gap between the duties of the position and their real performance,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
which depends on a particular living person.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
That is why the most useful thing will be to study this course in connection

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
with such management sections as communication, conflicts,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
management of changes in the organization.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
The formation of a structure is a practical process.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
When it is often more important to try than to think smartly.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
But before becoming a composer, a good musician learns to play classical music.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
We will start our meeting with a classical approach to the construction of organizational structures.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
After studying the first part of the video course, you will get an idea

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
of such fundamental characteristics of an organization as specialization,

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
management chain, linear management, norm of controllability,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
centralization, formalization.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
You will get acquainted with functional, divisional, matrix approaches

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
to the construction of an organizational structure,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
with the features of the organization construction operating on international markets.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
During the study of the second part of the video course,

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
you will get acquainted with the main differences between traditional vertical organizations

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
and modern training organizations.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
The questions of adaptation of organizational structures

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
to the changes in the strategy and the external environment in which the organization operates,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
as well as the questions of the influence of production technologies

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
and internal interdependencies on the structure of the company.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
In the process of performing practical tasks,

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
you will acquire the necessary skills, analysis and synthesis of organizational structures.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
To solve the question of which scheme of the organization is optimal

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
for specific data conditions,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
it is necessary to take into account the various approaches

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
proposed by the theories of organization formation.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Theories that claim that there is a single rational way of building an organization

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
are called universal.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Theories according to which the optimal structure can differ from situation to situation

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
depending on such factors as change of technology and external environment

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
are called situational.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
First of all, a classical approach is considered,

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
within which the emphasis is placed on structural factors, functions or types of activity

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
necessary to achieve the goal.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
As tasks are determined and their subsequent grouping,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
workplaces, departments and other units are formed

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
for the purpose of effective specialization and coordination of activities

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
within the framework of a physically normal workload of the leaders.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Then a coordination system is formed

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
by establishing the subordination of workers and the boundaries of their responsibility

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
in the hierarchy of management.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
For this approach, there are specific attempts to develop the rules,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
the so-called principles of the organization,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
acting as criteria for the construction of the organization.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Representatives of the School of Human Relations,

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
along with supporters of the behavioral approach,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
study the problems of motivation of people's behavior,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
leadership, group and intergroup behavior.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Such studies assess the social and psychological consequences

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
of various organizational changes

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
and provide recommendations on improving management procedures,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
policies, on creating such an organizational climate and such a structure,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
which stimulates the joint efforts of workers to achieve the goals of the organization.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
The systematic approach,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
where the main focus is on the relationship of interdependence

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
and the study of the company as a holistic system,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
differs from the previous two approaches.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
In general, this approach allows to understand the importance of information

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
and communication channels for the effective activity of the organization.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Various situational theories of the organization,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
characterizing the system orientation in general,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
emphasize various factors,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
adaptation of the organization to the requirements of technology,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
uncertainty of the external environment,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
peculiarities of decision-making processes.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
The last decades, marked by rapid changes in technology,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
increasing complexity and scientific capacity of production,

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
its globalization and the spread of modern information technologies,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
gave a new powerful push to theoretical generalizations

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
and applied scientific research in management.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Ideas and concepts that form the classical theory of the organization

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
were developed by many scientists and practitioners.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
One of the first attempts to analyze organizational aspects of management

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
was undertaken by Frederick Taylor and his followers.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
The ideas and methods that emerge from Taylor's research

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
are known as scientific management,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
in the center of which is the work carried out in the lower link of the organization.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The research on the theory of the organization

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
began to be carried out on a systematic basis

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
from 1890 to 1940,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
along with deepening of the developments in scientific management.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
In the center of attention of these studies is the whole organization,

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
not the work carried out by individual links or members of the organization.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
The principles of the organization,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
the criteria for the formation of organizational structures,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
the creation of a system of divisions,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
the definition of the management and delegation of rights and responsibilities were formulated.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
A significant contribution to the development of classical theory

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
was the development of bureaucratic theory,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
the basis of which is contained in the works of Max Weber.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Let's consider in more detail the key definitions of the classical theory of the organization.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Under the organization, the placement and use of resources of the organization

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
for achieving the strategic goals of the company is understood.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
The strategy, that is, what to do, determines the principles of the organization,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
that is, how to do.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
The process of the organization leads to the creation of an organizational structure

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
that determines the division of tasks,

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
as well as the placement and use of resources.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
There are two main aspects of the organizational process.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
This is the division of the organization into divisions,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
respectively, goals and strategies,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
and the relationship of powers,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
which bind the different levels of management

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
and provide the possibility of distribution and coordination of tasks.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
The complex of formal tasks and the relationship of formal accountability

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
determines the structure of vertical organizational control.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
The characteristics of the vertical structure

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
are usually reflected in the organizational diagram,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
which is a visual representation of the organization structure.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
The organizational diagram of the Sokov-Porosly plant is shown in the following slide.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
The enterprise performs many different tasks,

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
the high results of which are achieved in the case of specialization of employees.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
The company has four main departments

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
of finance and accounting, human resources, production and marketing.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
In each of the divisions, employees perform only those tasks

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
that are related to their specialized function.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Within the production department,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
specialization is expressed in the division of production tasks

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
into bottling juices, quality control and technical maintenance.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
The means by which the management establishes relations

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
between levels of authority is delegating.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Delegation, as a term used in the theory of management,

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
means the transfer of tasks and authority to a person

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
who takes responsibility for their performance.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Delegation is a means by which the management distributes

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
countless tasks among employees,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
which must be performed to achieve the goals of the entire organization.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
If a task is not delegated to another person,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
the manager will be forced to perform it himself.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
This is simply impossible in many cases,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
since the time and abilities of the manager are limited.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Responsibility is a duty to perform the tasks

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
and be responsible for their satisfactory solution.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
In fact, an individual concludes a contract with an organization

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
to perform the tasks of this position

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
in exchange for receiving a certain reward.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Delegation is carried out only in the case of taking authority,

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
and, in fact, responsibility cannot be delegated.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
The manager cannot wash away the responsibility

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
by giving it to his subordinate.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
Although the person who is responsible for the solution of any task

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
does not have to perform it personally,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
he remains responsible for the satisfactory completion of the work.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
The volume of responsibility is one of the reasons

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
for the high salaries of the managers of the higher rank.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
If it is assumed that some person will take responsibility

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
for the satisfactory completion of the task,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
the organization must provide him with the required resources.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
The management carries out this by delegating authority

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
along with the tasks.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Authority is a limited right to use the resources of the organization

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and direct the efforts of some of its employees

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
to perform certain tasks.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Authority is delegated to a position,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
not to an individual who is taking it at the moment.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
This is reflected in the old military saying

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
that honor is given to the uniform, not to a person.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
When an individual changes his job,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
he loses the authority of his old position

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
and gets the authority of a new one.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
However, since delegating is impossible

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
until a person is in office,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
they usually talk about delegating authority to an individual,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
the limits of authority.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
According to our definition,

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
authority is a limited right to use resources

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
and to command people.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Within the organization,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
these limits are usually determined by politics,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
procedures, rules and official instructions

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
in written form or are transmitted by word of mouth.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
The persons who go beyond these limits

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
exceed their authority,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
even when it is necessary to perform delegated tasks.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
For example, a worker authorized to work

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
only on a certain machine

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
would exceed his authority

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
by moving to another machine

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
if his own machine broke down.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
A more specific example would be a manager

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
who spends money allocated for service purposes

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
on personal needs,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
which exceeds the limits of his authority

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
on the use of representative resources.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
In general, the limits of authority

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
are expanding in the direction of higher levels of management.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
But even the authority of the higher management

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
is limited in one way or another.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
The chairman of the board of directors

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
and the president of a large open shareholder company

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
must answer to shareholders

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
if the costs are much higher than the total budget, for example.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Higher officials of the company

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
cannot raise their salaries,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
use the resources of the organization

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
without the approval of the board of directors.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Most of the authority of the manager

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
is determined by traditions,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
morals, cultural stereotypes,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
customs of the society

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
in which the organization functions.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
People obey the orders of the boss

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
partly because it is a socially acceptable behavior.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Authority and power are often confused.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Authority is defined as delegated,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
limited,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
inherent in this position

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
the right to use the resources of the organization.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
And power is a real ability to act

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
or an opportunity to influence the situation.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
You can have power without authority.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Authorities determine that a person

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
who occupies some position has the right to do,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and the authorities determine

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
that he can really do.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Linear authorities

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
are authorities that are transferred

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
directly from the boss to the subordinate

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
and then to other subordinates.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It is linear authorities

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
that represent the authorized authority

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
to direct their direct subordinates

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
to achieve the set goals.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Delegation of linear authorities

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
creates a hierarchy of levels of management of the organization.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
The process of creating a hierarchy

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
is called a scalar process.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Since the authority to be controlled by people

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
is usually transmitted through a scalar process,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
the resulting hierarchy is called

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
a scalar chain or a chain of commands.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
The concept of the formal chain of commands

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
was applied back in 1491 BC.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
The ancients saw that the best way

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
to ensure the clarity of coordination

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
is that the subordinate

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
should answer only to one boss

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
and give orders only to one boss.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
This principle is currently called

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
the principle of unanimity.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
This is probably the oldest established principle of the organization.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
In an organization that adheres to this principle,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
all formal communications

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
should be directed along the chain of commands.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
An employee cannot address any question

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
through the head of his boss

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
or the head of a higher rank

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
without the permission of the boss of the intermediate level.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Probably the most obvious example

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
of the chain of commands

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
is the hierarchy of military organizations.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Military of a certain rank

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
are easily distinguished from military of a higher or lower level

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
by the bandaging of the badges.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Here the hierarchy is really called a chain of commands.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
In the case of the organization,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
all employees from the president to the last office worker

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
wear the same clothes,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
but the chain of commands still exists.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Looking at the example of the plant in Roslevo-Sokol,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
you can see that the cashier obeys the chief accountant,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
who is in turn subordinate to the vice president,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
and the vice president obeys the president of the company.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
The norm of the management,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
the norm of the management is established

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
by delegating linear powers.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
The head of the higher rank,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
instead of creating a chain of commands,

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
may require that each employee

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
reports to him personally

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
in order to maintain, perhaps, more control.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
However, in practice, the inability to keep the norm of the management

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
at a fairly low level

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
means that the magnitude of the norm of the management

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
varies widely.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
The level of management,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
the nature of the tasks performed,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
the characteristics of the subordinates and the abilities of the head

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
all play a role in determining the number of people

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
directly and effectively controlled by the head.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
A number of authors consider the best norm of the management

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
to be from 7 to 10 subordinates.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
In many organizations, it is 30-40 employees or more.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
In general, if the manager

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
is constantly closely interacting with the subordinates,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
the norm of the management should be small.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
And in cases when the need is absent in direct communication,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
the norm can be increased.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Perform the practical task number 1.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Draw a structural diagram of your company

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
and analyze it from the point of view

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
of the number of levels of management.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Determine the norm of the management for various units.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Think about the impact of which factors

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
determines the norm of the management in a particular unit.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Before trying to determine the staff powers,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
let's briefly consider the origin of the administrative apparatus

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
to understand why in some situations

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
linear powers cannot meet the needs of the organization.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
The first concept of the staff was used

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
in the armies of Alexander the Great,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
that is, in 336-323 BC.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
It was difficult for an officer in the heat of battle

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
to effectively command his people

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
and simultaneously develop strategic plans.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
But since planning and management

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
are absolutely necessary for victory in any military operation,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
a way to ensure them should be found.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
It was decided to divide the task of achieving victory

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
in the wars between two types of military specialists

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
– officers who make plans

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
and officers who command soldiers in battle.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
However, this division has created a potential problem.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Since soldiers are obliged to obey the orders of all officers,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
they could easily get confused in a situation

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
when the orders given to the officers on planning

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
contradict the orders of their direct boss.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
To avoid this, the powers of commanding people

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
were taken away from the planners,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
and since they were the assistants of the senior officer,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
they were called the staff.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
The staff apparatus of the organization can be classified

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
into three main types –

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
consultative apparatus, service apparatus and personal apparatus.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
However, in practice, it is very rare to find such a division

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
between these types.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
The duty of the consultative apparatus

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
is to consult the line leadership

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
in their field of knowledge.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
This can be law, technology,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
training, work with personnel, etc.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
In any field where a consultative apparatus is used,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
its functions are often distributed

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
to perform certain services.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
For example, the personnel department,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
which conducts the personal affairs of the employees,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
finds and checks potential candidates for work

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
and, in some cases, supplies the line leadership

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
the required personnel.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Thus, the department performs both consultative

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
and service functions.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
The personal apparatus is a variety of service apparatus

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
that is formed when the manager

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
is appointed to perform the tasks

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
of the manager.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
In the organization, the member of this apparatus

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
has no powers,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
he acts only on the instructions of the manager.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
However, he can have great power.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
To understand the concept of the apparatus in modern organizations,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
it is necessary to consider the nature of the powers delegated to him.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Staff powers can be limited,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
but they can be purely consultative

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
or so common that the border between them

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
and the line duties almost disappears.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Let's consider the basic types of staff powers

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
and the basis of their application.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
When the staff powers are reduced to the recommended powers,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
it is assumed that the line leadership

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
will consult the consultative apparatus

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
when it needs its knowledge.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
But the line leaders are not obliged to do so.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
They can solve the problem in their own way,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
without even making the apparatus known.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
When the staff powers of the apparatus are recommended,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
it often has to spend time

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
convincing the line leaders

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
about the value of its services and proposals.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Even if they appealed for advice to the apparatus

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
and it was accepted, the line leaders can still neglect it,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
which can undoubtedly lead to conflicts

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
between the line leadership and the administrative and management apparatus.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Since the apparatus may experience difficulties

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
in communication with the line leadership,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
the company sometimes expands the powers of the apparatus

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
to mandatory agreements.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
When the agreements are mandatory,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
the line leadership must discuss the appropriate situation

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
with the staff apparatus before taking any action.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
However, the line leaders are not obliged

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
to follow the recommendations of the apparatus.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
The higher management can expand the powers of the apparatus,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
giving it the right to reject the decisions of the line leadership.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
The goal of parallel powers

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
is to establish a control system

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
to balance power

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
and prevent gross mistakes.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
In many companies,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
parallel powers are used

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
to control financial expenses,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
which requires two signatures

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
in the case of all major purchases.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
The apparatus, which has functional powers,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
can offer and prohibit some actions

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
in the field of its competence.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
In fact, the line powers of the president of the organization

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
are implemented through the apparatus,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
but the apparatus is not able to do this.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
The functional powers eliminate the difference

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
between the line and the staff powers

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
for all practical purposes.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
In large organizations,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
the apparatus can consist of many people.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
In such situations, the apparatus is a division

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
with more than one level of management.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
That is, the staff apparatus itself has a linear organization

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Delegation requires effective communication,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
and the subordinates must understand exactly

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
what the leader wants.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Delegation is also related to motivation,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
influence and leadership.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
The leader must make the subordinates

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
to effectively perform their tasks.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
As in all processes of information exchange

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
and influence, both sides have a significant

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
role in achieving success.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Taking this into account, William Newman listed

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
a number of reasons why leaders may

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
reluctantly delegate powers,

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
and subordinates will avoid additional responsibility.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
So, the reasons for the leaders' reluctance

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
to delegate powers.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
This is a delusion, I will do it better.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
This is the lack of ability to lead,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
lack of trust in subordinates,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
fear of risk, lack of election control

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
to warn the leadership about possible dangers.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Subordinates avoid responsibility

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
and block the process of delegating

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
for the following reasons.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Subordinates may find it more convenient to ask the boss

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
what to do than to solve the problem themselves.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Subordinates are also afraid of criticism for mistakes.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
The more responsibility, the more likely such a mistake.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
Subordinates have no information

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
or resources necessary for the task.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Subordinates may also lack confidence in themselves

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
or lack positive incentives

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
to additional responsibility.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
To make delegating effective,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
there must be a correspondence between powers and responsibility.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
That is, the leadership must delegate

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
powers sufficient for the fulfillment of all tasks

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
for which he took responsibility.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
This is called the principle of correspondence.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
High responsibility means more work

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
and more risk for the person taking it.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Expanding the responsibility of subordinates

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
should be supported by a system of stimulation,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
which provides them with rewards

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
for taking this time.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Recent studies have shown

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
that employees have less motivation for work

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
if they think they give more to the organization

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
than they receive from it.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
As a result, the absence of positive incentives

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
to take on additional responsibility

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
can block reasonable attempts to distribute powers.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Do the practical task number two.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Think about how effective the process of delegating

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
powers in your organization is.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
What can you offer to eliminate the reasons

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
that block delegating?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Centralization and decentralization

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Our next topic is centralization and decentralization.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Organizations in which the leadership of the higher link

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
leaves behind most of the powers

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
necessary for making the most important decisions

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
are called centralized.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Decentralized organizations

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
are such organizations

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
in which powers are distributed

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
at the lowest levels of management.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
In highly decentralized organizations,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
the managers of the middle link

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
have very great powers in specific areas of activity.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
However, in practice, there are no fully centralized

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
or decentralized organizations.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Such organizations are only the limit points

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
of a certain continuum

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
between which all types of structures

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
that meet in practice lie.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Therefore, any organization can be called centralized

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
or decentralized only in comparison

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
with other organizations or in comparison with itself,

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
but in other periods.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
It is possible to determine the level of centralization

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
in comparison with others

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
by following its characteristics.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
The first of them is the number of decisions

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
made at the lowest levels of management.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
The more decisions made by the lower managers,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
the greater the degree of decentralization.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
The second characteristic is the importance of decisions

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
made at the lowest levels.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
In a decentralized organization,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
the managers of the middle and lower links

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
can make decisions related to the costs

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
of significant material and labor resources

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
or the direction of the organization's activity

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
in a new direction.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
The next characteristic is the consequences of decisions

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
made at the lowest levels.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
If the managers of the middle and lower links

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
can make decisions affecting more than one function,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
then the organization is, apparently, decentralized.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
The next characteristic is the number of control

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
over the work of subordinates.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
In a highly decentralized organization,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
the management of the higher link rarely checks

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
the daily decisions of its subordinates.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Based on the assumption that all these decisions are correct,

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
the assessment of the actions of the management

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
is based on the total achieved results,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
profitability and growth of the organization.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Within the same organization,

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
some departments can be more centralized than others.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
For example, in the McDonald's restaurant network,

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
the managers of the restaurants have almost unlimited power

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
to make decisions regarding their staff

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
and some powers in the selection of purchased products.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
In this company, decisions on the placement

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
of new restaurants and stores

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
are made in the middle management links,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
while decisions determining the price level

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
and the release of new goods

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
are made only by the higher management.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
In ordinary hospitals, administrative functions

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
have a high degree of centralization,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
but the medical staff and, first of all,

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
the doctors are almost completely autonomous

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
and independent in their actions.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
In large part of decentralized organizations,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
the higher management leaves the right

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
to make decisions on issues such as

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
determining the common goals and tasks of the organization,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
strategic planning,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
formulation of company policies in various areas,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
development of the company's financial and accounting system.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Most corporations have a decentralized organization.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Their general structure is based on the principle

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
of federal decentralization,

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
in which the managers of the most important departments

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
can act almost completely autonomously

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
in everything that concerns the production of their products.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Both centralization and decentralization

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
have their disadvantages and advantages,

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
the ratio of which is determined by external

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
and internal variables.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
The advantages of centralization include

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
the improvement of control and coordination

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
of specialized independent functions,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
the reduction of the number and scale of error decisions

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
made by less experienced managers,

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
the absence of a situation in which

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
some departments of the organization grow and develop

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
due to other departments or organizations in general,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
and the experience and knowledge of the staff

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
of the central administrative body

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
The advantages of decentralization include

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
simplification of the decision-making process.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
Decisions are made by the manager

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
who is closest to the problem

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
and, therefore, knows it best.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Decentralization stimulates initiative

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
and allows the personality to identify itself with the organization.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
The manager can feel the same enthusiasm

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
in his department as independent entrepreneurs

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
in all their business.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
Decentralization helps to prepare the young manager

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
for higher positions,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
giving him the opportunity to make important decisions

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
at the very beginning of his career.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
The disadvantages of centralization are that

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
it closes the way to the benefits of decentralization.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
And vice versa.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
The manager must analyze the situation in the organization

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
and choose the level of decision-making

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
that best meets its needs.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
The need to make radical changes

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
and a high level of uncertainty of the external environment

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
are favored by decentralization.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
The ratio of centralization and decentralization

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
should be adequate for the firm's strategy.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
During a crisis or in cases

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
when direct threats arise,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
the power and authority, as a rule,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
are concentrated in the hands of the top managers of the organization.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Perform the practical task number 3.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Evaluate the ratio of centralization and decentralization

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
in your company.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
What factors have a significant impact on this process?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Our next topic is the design of the organizational structure.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
The best structure is the one that best allows the organization

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
to interact effectively with the external environment,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
to distribute and direct the efforts of its employees

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
productively and purposefully

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
and thus meet the needs of the clients

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
and achieve their goals with high efficiency.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
The design should be based on the strategic plans of the organization.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
This approach was designed

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
to be able to meet the needs of the organization

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
This approach was proposed by Alfred Chandler,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
who for many years studied the changes

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
in organizational structures of companies

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
such as General Motors and DuPont.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
His famous principle says

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
that the strategy determines the structure.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
This means that the structure of the organization

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
should be such to ensure the implementation of its strategy.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Since over time, strategies change,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
it will be necessary to make appropriate changes

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
in organizational structures.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
According to the classical theory of organization,

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
the structure of the organization should be developed from top to bottom.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
At the beginning, the managers should divide the organization

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
into wide areas,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
then set specific tasks,

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
just like in planning,

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
first general tasks are formed,

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
then the specific plans are formed,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
and finally the organizational design stages.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
The sequence of actions will be as follows.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
First, divide the organization horizontally

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
into wide blocks corresponding

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
to the most important areas of activity

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
in the implementation of the strategy.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Decide which types of activities should be performed

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
by linear units, and which by staff units.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Third, determine the ratio of powers of various positions.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
At the same time, the management sets a chain of commands

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
if necessary,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
to make further divisions into smaller organizational units

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
to more effectively use specialization

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
and avoid overloading the management.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Third, determine the duties

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
as a combination of certain tasks and functions

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
and assign them to specific persons.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
In organizations whose activity is largely connected

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
with technology,

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
the management even develops specific tasks

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
and assigns them to the direct performers,

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
who are responsible for their satisfactory performance.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
It is important to understand that the organizational structure

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
that has emerged as a result of the development

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
is an unhardened form, similar to the frame of a building.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Since organizational structures are based on plans,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
significant changes in the plans may require

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
corresponding changes in the structure.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
In fact, in existing organizations,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
the process of changing the organizational structure

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
should be treated as a reorganization,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
since this process, like all functions of the organization,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
is endless.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Currently, successfully functioning organizations

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
regularly assess the degree of adequacy

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
of their organizational structures

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
and change them as required by external conditions.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
The requirements of the external environment,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
in turn, are determined during planning and control.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
The development of formal rules, policies, instructions, procedures,

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
descriptions of work, instructions,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
in accordance with which management and control

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
over the activities of employees is carried out

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
is called formalization.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Such documents complement the organizational scheme,

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
describing tasks, distributing responsibility

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
and authority for making management decisions.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
The widespread use of such documents

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
is an integral part of the bureaucratic management model,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
the first systematically developed model

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
of the organizational structure,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
which remains its main and dominant form.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
The word bureaucracy is usually mentioned

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
in the picture of the office work,

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
bad work, useless activity,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
long-term expectations to receive certificates

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
or forms that have long been canceled.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
All this really happens.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
However, the root cause of all these negative phenomena

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
is not bureaucracy as such,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
but the lack of implementation of the rules of work

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
and the goals of the organization,

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
the behavior of employees,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
the inappropriate rules and tasks of the organization.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
The concept of bureaucracy,

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
originally formulated by the German sociologist

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Max Weber in the early 1900s,

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
is ideally one of the most useful ideas

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
in the history of mankind.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
Weber's theory did not contain descriptions

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
of specific organizations.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
The idea of a bureaucracy is more like a normative model,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
as an ideal to which organizations should strive.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
This is clear from the table,

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
where the characteristics of the system

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
called Weber's rational bureaucracy

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
are given in a sum.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
The following characteristics are suitable for rational bureaucracy.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
First of all, this is a clear division of labor,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
which leads to the appearance of highly qualified specialists

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
in each position.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
This is the hierarchy of management levels,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
in which each lower level is controlled by the higher one

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
and subordinated to it.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
This is the presence of a interconnected system

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
of generalized formal rules and standards,

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
ensuring uniformity of the performance of its responsibilities

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
and coordination of various tasks.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
This is the spirit of formal indifference,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
with which official persons perform their official duties

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
and the implementation of hiring

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
in strict accordance with the technical and qualification requirements

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
protected from employees from arbitrary dismissals.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
Thus, the bureaucratic organizational structure

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
is characterized by a high degree of division of labor,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
a developed hierarchy of management,

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
a chain of commands,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
the presence of numerous rules and standards of personnel behavior,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
a selection of personnel

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
according to their business and professional qualities.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Weber called such a structure rational,

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
because it is assumed that decisions made by the bureaucracy

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
have an objective nature.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
Weber believed that the personal preferences

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
of the owners of the organization and its employees

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
should not contradict the goals of the organization.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
These ideas did not coincide with the practice of working

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
of most organizations until 1900.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Bureaucracy is often called a classical

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
or traditional organizational structure.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
Most modern organizations

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
are variants of bureaucracy.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
The objectivity of decisions made

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
allows the bureaucracy to adapt to the changes.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Promotion of employees based on their competencies

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
allows to ensure constant and consistent

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
influx of highly qualified and talented technical specialists

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
and administrative workers.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
However, bureaucracy has often been severely criticized.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
The difficulties arising in bureaucratic structures

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
are associated with an increase in the significance

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
of standardized rules and procedures,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
those norms that ensure the proper execution

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
of their tasks by employees.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
The organization, at the same time,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
loses the flexibility of behavior.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Departmentalization means the process of dividing the organization

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
into separate blocks,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
which can be called departments,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
branches, or sectors.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
Functional departmentalization is the process

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
of dividing the organization into separate elements,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
each of which has its own clearly defined

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
specific task and responsibilities.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
In principle, the creation of a functional structure

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
is reduced to a grouping of staff

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
on the broad tasks they perform.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
In companies that process industry,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
this is a division by technology of mass production.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Traditional functional blocks of a company

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
are departments of production, marketing, and finance.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
In organizations not related to business,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
the names of functional departments

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
are the most diverse.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
In the army, for example,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
there are infantry, artillery, and armored units.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
In hospitals there are administrative and medical departments.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
If the size of all organizations or this department is large,

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
then the main functional departments

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
can be divided into smaller functional departments.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
The structure of the organization,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
the functional departments of which are divided

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
into secondary units, are the most important.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
A functional structure stimulates

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
business and professional specialization,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
reduces duplication of efforts

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
and consumption of material resources,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
improves coordination in functional areas.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
A well-known example of regional organizational structures

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
can be household organizations of large companies.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
An example of the use of a regional structure

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
outside of a commercial organization

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
can be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
It is known to the embassies and consulates of Russia around the world.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Many other government institutions,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
especially those such as the Tax Service,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
which are constantly dealing with their clients,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
also apply a regional structure.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
The relative advantages and disadvantages

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
of regional organizational structures are similar to those

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
of products and consumers.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Various types of divisional structures

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
have the same advantages and disadvantages

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
because they have the same goal

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
to ensure a more effective reaction of the organization

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
to one or another factor of the environment.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
A product structure allows

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
to easily cope with the development of new types of products

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
based on the concept of competition,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
improvement of technology

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
or satisfaction of the consumer's needs.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
A regional structure allows the organization

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
to more effectively take into account local legislation,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
the social and economic system and markets

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
as the geographical expansion of its market zones.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
As for the structure oriented to the consumer,

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
it gives the organization the opportunity

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
to most effectively take into account the requests of those consumers

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
from whom it depends the most.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Thus, the choice of a divisional structure

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
should be based on which of these factors

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
is the most important

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
in terms of ensuring the implementation

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
of the organization's strategic plans and achieving its goals.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
Perform the practical task number 4.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Analyze how much the principles of rational bureaucracy

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
are implemented in your organization.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
What type of departmentalization is typical for your company?

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
Organization structures of companies operating on international markets.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
For a similar organization operating on the scale of one country,

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
companies operating at the international level

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
should choose an organizational structure

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
that corresponds to their strategy.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
The choice of an organizational structure of such companies

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
is determined by three main strategic factors.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
First, how to encourage the organization

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
operating mainly within the country

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
to fully use the opportunities available abroad

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
for its growth.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Second, how to most effectively use the knowledge of production

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
and various geographical regions

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
in order to coordinate business activity

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
at the international level.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Third, how to coordinate the activities of foreign branches

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
and branches in many countries,

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
while preserving their own face.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
Since organizational structures of international corporations

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
are very difficult to analyze,

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
we will limit ourselves to a brief overview of their basic types.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
An entrepreneur who wants to enter the foreign market

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
with one or several types of new products

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
usually introduces a position of an export manager,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
which is subordinated to the management of the marketing department.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Companies that have significantly increased

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
the volume of sales on foreign markets

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
will begin to study the possibility of creating

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
their own production capacities in the corresponding countries.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
However, for foreign sales

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
in the total volume of the produced product,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
the share of these foreign sales

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
will remain relatively small.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
The head of each foreign production branch

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
is subordinate to the executive director or president of the entire company.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
At the same time, the central management of the company

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
usually provides assistance to its foreign branches

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
in matters of production,

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
marketing, financial and human resources.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
A certain part of the staff of the company's main management

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
is transferred to foreign branches

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
in order to ensure the effective implementation

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
of strategic plans and tasks of the company as a whole.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
As the company's business activity

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
on the international markets grows,

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
it usually creates a special international branch.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
At the same time, all functions

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
that ensure the activity of the company on foreign markets

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
are concentrated in this branch.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
The position of the head of such a branch is established,

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
and it is subordinate to the president of the company.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
As a rule, such a head has a fairly wide authority

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
in all functions and activities of foreign branches.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
The divisional structure with the international branch

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
is presented in the following slide.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Companies that create a divisional structure

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
with an international branch

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
have a relatively small volume of foreign sales

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
compared to sales within the country,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
a limited product nomenclature

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
and a geography of foreign markets.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
However, as the volume of foreign sales increases,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
the expansion of the assortment of produced products

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
and the promotion of the company to new economic regions,

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
the international divisional structure

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
begins to constrain the company.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
At this point, the organizations usually move

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
to the formation of a global structure.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
The global product structure

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
and the global regional structure

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
are shown in the following slides.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
The global product structure is most suitable

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
for those companies that have a greater difference

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
between the types of products produced

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
than the difference between the regions

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
in which they are sold.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
The difference in production is often due to the fact

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
that the company produces a wide range of products

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
that require various technologies.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
If the organization is structured

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
according to the produced product,

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
it is much easier to achieve the necessary

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
technological export specializations and coordination.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
The geographical regional structure

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
is more suitable for those

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
where regional differences are more important

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
Regional differences are often due to the fact

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
that various foreign clients of the company

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
are concentrated in regions with different traditions,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
legislation, culture and consumption of products.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
As a result, the organization's design

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
is carried out according to the criteria

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
of customer demand and marketing methods

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
in these regions.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
Perform the practical task number 5.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
It is a question of the technical situation

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
that has developed in one of the Russian metallurgical companies

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
and the answer to the questions of the case.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Since the 1960s, some organizations

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
have faced such a situation

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
when the external conditions of their activities

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
have changed so quickly.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Projects have become so complex,

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
that the organizational structure

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
of the company has become more complex.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
The structure of the traditional organizational structure,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
especially where the chain of command is long,

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
can slow down the interaction

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
and the process of development of solutions

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
to such an extent that the organization

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
could no longer effectively react to the changes.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
In order for organizations to be able

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
to implement new technology,

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
adaptive organizational structures have been developed.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
The structures are called adaptive

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
because they can be quickly modified

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
in accordance with the changes in the environment

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
and the needs of the organization itself.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
Another name for these more flexible systems

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
is organic structures.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
It is connected with their ability

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
to adapt to the changes in the environment

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
and to adapt to the changes in the environment

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
in accordance with the changes in the environment.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Organic or adaptive structures

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
are not just some kind of variation of bureaucracy

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
as is the divisional structure.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
The organic structure is built on the goals

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
and assumptions radically different

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
from those that lie at the base of bureaucracy.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
Organic structures are built on the goals

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
and assumptions radically different

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
from those that lie at the base of bureaucracy.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
Each specialist solves his task

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
as something separate from the real tasks

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
before the organization as a whole.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
In the case of an organic structure,

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
employees must solve their specific tasks

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
in the light of the tasks of the company as a whole.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
This is because they must be constantly reviewed

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
as a result of interaction with other participants

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
in solving this task.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
This interaction occurs both vertically and horizontally.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Interaction between employees of different ranks

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
is like a consultation of two colleagues

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
than an order from the boss to a subordinate.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
It should be noted that organic and bureaucratic structures

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
are just two extreme points in the continuum of structures,

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
and the real structures of real organizations

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
lie between them, having signs of both bureaucratic

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
and organic structures in different ratios.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
have signs of both bureaucratic and organic structures in different ratios.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
In addition, it often happens that

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
various divisions within one organization

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
have different structures.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
Often, for example, the management of an organization

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
uses mechanical, that is, bureaucratic structures

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
and in scientific and research organizations — organic structures.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
The dependence of the structure of an organization

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
on the pace of the environment is shown in the following slide.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
In order to effectively manage large-scale projects

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
of limited duration,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
for example, the construction of a building

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
or the launch of a spaceship,

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
more and more organizations began to use

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
special project organization.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
A project organization is a temporary structure

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
created to solve a specific task.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
Its purpose is to bring together

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
the most qualified employees of the organization

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
to carry out a complex project

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
in the set time and set quality level,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
without going beyond the set cost.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
When the project is completed, the team is disbanded,

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
its members move on to a new project,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
return to their permanent work in their home department

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
or leave the organization.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
The main advantage of a project organization

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
is that it concentrates all efforts

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
on solving a single task.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
While the head of a regular department

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
must be split between several projects at the same time,

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
the project manager focuses

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
exclusively on him.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
In the so-called clean or combined project structures,

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
a temporary group of specialists

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
is essentially a reduced-scale copy

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
of the permanent functional structure

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
of the given organization.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
In this case, the project manager

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
is fully subordinate to all the members of the group

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
and all the resources allocated to solve this task.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Clean project structures are used

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
only to solve any large-scale tasks.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Another type of project structure

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
is called a matrix organization.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
The beginning of the use of a matrix organization

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
was assumed by medium-sized aerospace companies

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
in the 1950s and 1960s.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
These companies were too small

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
to be an effective clean project organization.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Nevertheless, they were large enough

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
to face the problems of functional structures

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
in which the integration of information about the project

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
takes place only at the very top of the pyramid of management.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
Such companies as General Electric and Shell Oil

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
conducted experiments

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
on applying the project structure

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
to the permanent functional structure for these organizations.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
The diagram of such a structure

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
is shown in the following slide.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
It resembles a lattice, hence the name of the matrix structure.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
In a matrix organization,

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
the members of the project group

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
are subordinate to both the project manager

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
and the managers of the functional departments

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
in which they work constantly.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
The project manager has so-called project powers.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
These powers can vary

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
from almost omnipresent personal linear power

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
to almost pure staff powers.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
The choice of a specific option

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
is determined by the rights delegated to it

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
by the higher management of the organization.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
Project managers are responsible in general

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
for the integration of all types of activities and resources

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
related to this project.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
They are also responsible for planning the project

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
and check the course of the project.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
The functional departments

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
delegate some of their responsibilities to the project manager.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
They decide where and how a particular work should be done,

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
as well as control the course of the task.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
The main drawback of the matrix structure

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
is its complexity.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
A lot of problems arise

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
due to the addition of vertical and horizontal powers,

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
which undermines the principle of unanimity.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
There is a struggle for power,

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
conformity in the adoption of group decisions,

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
excessive overhead costs.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Despite these possible difficulties,

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
the matrix structure, if used effectively,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
gives the organization the opportunity

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
to gain some advantages.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
It allows to achieve certain flexibilities

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
that are never present in functional structures,

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
but are constantly fixed

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
behind certain functional departments.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
As new projects appear,

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
labor resources can be flexibly redistributed

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
depending on the specific needs of each project.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
In addition to a much greater flexibility,

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
the matrix organization gives a greater opportunity

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
to coordinate the work typical for division structures.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
This is achieved by creating a position

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
of the project manager,

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
who coordinates all the connections

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
between project participants

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
working in various functional departments.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
Note that in matrix organizations,

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
the divisional command structure

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
can have a different orientation,

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
for example, a product one, as shown in the following slide.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
For companies operating on international markets,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
the duality of the management chain

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
is the main reason for contradictions

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
arising in the matrix structure.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
At the same time, it is successfully used

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
by such companies as IBM, Ford Motor, and others.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
Another approach to creating adaptive organizational structures

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
is associated with the emergence of a conglomerate type organization.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
This is not some established or orderly structure,

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
but a type of organization

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
that is best suited for a given specific situation.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Thus, in one department of the company

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
a product structure can be used,

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
in another a functional structure,

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
and in the third a project or matrix structure.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
The leadership of the higher link of the corporation

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
is responsible for long-term planning,

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
development of policy,

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
as well as the implementation of the project.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
This central group is surrounded by a number of companies

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
that are either independent economic units

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
or in fact independent companies.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
These companies are fully autonomous

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
in relation to operational decisions.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
They are subordinate to the main company

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
mainly in matters of finance.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
It is expected that they will achieve the intended profit indicators,

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
and that they will be able to provide a stable and stable business.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
It is expected that they will achieve the intended profit indicators

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
and will keep the costs within the limits

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
established for the entire conglomerate by the leadership of the higher link.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
There is almost no interdependence

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
between the individual companies

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
that are part of the conglomerate,

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
unlike typical departmentalization.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
The conglomerate can sell any company

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
that is part of it due to its unsatisfactory activity

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
and will not be able to buy a company with good economic indicators.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
These changes will not even be noticed

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
by other units of the conglomerate.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
These opportunities made the conglomerates very popular

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
among entrepreneurs in science-intensive industries,

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
where it is necessary to quickly switch to new types of products

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
and quickly stop the production of outdated products.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The latest approach to departmentalization

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
involves further development of the idea of coordination

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
and cooperation in a horizontal plane within the framework of the organization.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
The network structure means

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
that the company assigns many of its main functions

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
to independent sub-counteragents,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and it itself takes the form of a small head organization

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
coordinating their activities.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
The network organization is usually depicted

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
as a node or center

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
surrounded by a network of third-party entities.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Accounting, production, design, logistics, distribution

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and other functions are assigned to third-party organizations.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
With the help of the Internet and computer networks,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
the exchange of information between them happens so quickly

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
that this separate system acts as a single company.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Such a company achieves high results

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
in its activity by using the network

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
and the network of third-party entities.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
The organization is also responsible

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
for the high results of its activities

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
by using a smaller volume of resources

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
due to the fact that all the necessary special functions

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
are performed by professionals

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
with the appropriate competencies.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
The disadvantages of network structures can be attributed

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
to the lack of direct management control,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
the possibility of undesirable loss of organizational parts,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
low loyalty of employees

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and the lack of a proper management of corporate culture.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
There is no optimal organization structure for all situations.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
As in all management processes,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
there is only the most suitable way

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
for this situation in the design of organizations.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
The relative effectiveness of a particular type

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
of organizational structure

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
is determined by various external and internal factors.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
If some organizations function

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
in an environment different from that of other organizations,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
then, accordingly, the structures should also differ.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Another important factor in the design of an organization

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
is related to its integration

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
or, as it is often called, coordination of organizations.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
In order for our body to be healthy and agile,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
it needs a well-coordinated muscle system,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
a breathing system, blood circulation,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
a nervous system, a central nervous system,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and the most important condition for the organization's effectiveness

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
is the unity of goals.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It is not enough for each unit

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
to work effectively on its own.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
If one or two units are not integrated

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
in the overall structure of the organization,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
the organization will not be successful.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
The methods of achieving effective integration

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
are shown in the following slide.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Such methods of integration, as a rule,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
procedures, schedules, hierarchical management structures

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
have proven to be good

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
in this type of environment

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
that characterizes by relative stability,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
predictability,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
slow market changes

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
of the technologies used by the competitors.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Such methods of integration, as personal relationships,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
joint committees,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
inter-functional creative teams and working groups,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
as well as inter-individual meetings,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
have proven to be good

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
in this type of environment

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
that characterizes by mobility, variability,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
rapid market changes and technologies used.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
If an organization or its unit

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
is characterized by the use of technologies

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and the use of different products,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
more diverse tasks and qualified workforce,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
it will be possible to achieve a successful integration.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
The next topic is

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
the modern approaches to integration.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
The next topic is

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
the modern approaches to integration.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
The next topic is

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
the modern approaches to integration.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
The next topic is

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
the modern approaches to building organizational structures

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
and situational factors affecting the choice of structure.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
In modern conditions,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
the majority of technical and non-technical tasks

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
are based on knowledge.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Companies no longer need

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
numerous unqualified workforce for assembly lines.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Most of the work requires technical knowledge

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and trained workers.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Moreover, the smallest number of workers

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
is engaged in production of products.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
The majority of employees of the organization

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
perform such work as marketing,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
design, technical design,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
technical and economic analysis,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
accounting, management.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
This requires professional experience and knowledge.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
The majority of the work is engaged

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
in services in commercial and other organizations.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
According to estimates,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
one third of all jobs are already occupied

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
by highly productive teams,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
whose representatives can be called intellectual workers.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
The very nature of intellectual work,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
which includes information gathering,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
creative search, experiments,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
is a key part of intellectual work.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
In certain conditions,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
remote control from the manager

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
interferes with work.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Managers are aimed at performing the work

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
if the executors feel that

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
their group is being paid attention to.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
The norms of bureaucracy do not imply

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
the care for the workers,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
but their complete submission and loyalty to the manager.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Bureaucracy is too autocratic

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
and guided by norms to motivate

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
intellectual activity and manage it.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Creativity and joint work require

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
an interested attitude, personal responsibility,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
flexibility in thinking and actions.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
In fact, the so-called norms of bureaucracy

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
block innovation and care for people,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and contradict the meaning of modern activity.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Many bureaucratic researchers emphasize

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
that in a bureaucratic organization

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
proper attention is not paid to training workers as an innovation,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
to teamwork and to attention to others.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
For many years, corporations have used

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
effective methods of training creativity

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and rationalization thinking,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
but this training was aimed at correcting

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
mistakes in education.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
In modern conditions, it is necessary to acquire

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
experience of working in a collective,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
to show initiative and responsibility in joint activity,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
to be able to participate in self-management.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
As experience shows,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
bureaucratic systems,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
having pre-implemented the discipline of the team chain,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
do not have enough variety of means

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
to solve the existing problems.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Meanwhile, each active innovation in management

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
is based on the strength of the team,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
on inter-functional and inter-linear working groups.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Organizations become more informed

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
when they find an opportunity to use

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
a variety of knowledge of each person in the team for common goals.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
With the transition of workers from static work

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
to solving a number of problems,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
it becomes necessary to use project management.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Each project requires, as a rule,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
the creation of interdisciplinary groups.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Control functions go from the bureaucratic system

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
to the project teams.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Increasing number of works requires

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
the unification of knowledge and experience of various specialists.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Less and less work is done

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
within the framework of only one specialization.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
The project worker should be both a narrow specialist

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and have a wider knowledge.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Rough intervention of the management

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
in the activities of the project teams inevitably leads to contradictions,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
to unnecessary difficulties in solving the tasks.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
In an intellectual organization,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
the involvement of workers in the project teams

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
allows to promptly identify all the problem nodes.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
At the same time, the mechanism of feedback with the consumers

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
is also important.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
In these conditions, the tasks that arise again are solved

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
not by increasing the number of workers,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
but on the basis of increasing their qualifications and interoperability,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
strengthening the flexibility of the workforce

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
by conducting multifunctional training.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
In order for the organization to become adaptive,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the preferences of consumers should have a significant influence

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
on the activities of the workers.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
The process of transmitting such information through managers is very slow.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
In addition, they may not always know

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
the internal needs of the company and the needs of the market.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
If the internal consumer cannot quickly get what is necessary,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
the system cannot operate

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and flexibly serve external consumers.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The freedom of choice between alternative suppliers

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
gives users of internal services the rights

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
that external consumers use.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
At the same time, the emphasis shifts from the power of managers

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
to the power of consumers.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
In a bureaucratic system,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
the coordination of work with each other at its level

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
is not included in the duties of the workers.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
In a post-bureaucratic organization,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
most of the inter-functional connections

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
and even many common issues are solved at the level of the working groups.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Working teams, including workers of all functionalities,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
have the authority to make decisions on all issues.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Instead of fighting bureaucracy,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
teams work together.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
They study the market,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
determine the value of each product,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
its characteristics,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
appearance and methods of operation.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
The reality has become so complex and multifaceted

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
that there is no point in dividing the organization into chains

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
where teams will be transferred to solve each emerging problem.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
As a result, integration is achieved

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
not hierarchically,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
but at one inter-functional communication level.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
In a modern organization,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
information is transmitted directly without intermediaries.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Relations of alienation, formality and inequality

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
are replaced by relations of openness,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
honesty and relative equality.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
These new realities are designed to completely change the organization.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
The highest point of the listed trends

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
is a new type of organization

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
called the training organization.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
There is no common opinion

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
that what a training organization is.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Rather, it is an installation or philosophy

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
of the organization's most desirable portrait.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
In the following slide,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
the characteristics of two types of organizations

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
are compared –

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
modern training and traditional vertical.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
In a traditional organization,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
a vertical structure prevails.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Horizontal coordination is carried out

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
by a few special groups,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
teams or project managers.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Information flows are formalized

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
and from bottom to top in the hierarchy of management.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Information exchange is limited.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
In addition, tasks are divided into narrow,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
specialized tasks of the operation,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and employees are usually not entitled

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
to determine how to perform them.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
The culture is rigid,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
does not encourage risk and change.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Decisions are made centrally.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
The organization is a place

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
where each employee participates

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
in the identification and solution of problems,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
which opens up opportunities

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
for continuous experiments,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
changes, improvements,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
which develops its ability to grow,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
to learn and to achieve the goal.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
The training organization is characterized

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
by the strict adoption of decisions,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
the empowerment of employees

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
and a strong adaptive culture.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
In modern training organizations,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
there is no usual vertical structure

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
separating the top from the bottom,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
and the units of structural division

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
are not functional departments,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
but working streams and core processes.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
The organization is a place

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
where employees are trained

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
to create new goods or to fulfill orders.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
They work hand in hand,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
which significantly simplifies communication

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
and coordination of joint efforts.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
The bricks from which the training organization is made

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
are self-managed teams

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
including employees of different specialties,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
who directly contact the buyers

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
and, if necessary, make adjustments

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
to the implementation of the operation and the produced product.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
The team members have the right

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
to decide on a wide range of issues

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
affecting the organization and production.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Training, security,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
leave schedule, work methods,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
payment and reward system,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and the organization's core values

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
are not based on strengthening the boundaries

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
with other companies,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
but on their elimination.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Cooperation between organizations

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
is provided by combining

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
self-managed and virtual teams,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
alliances and partnerships,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
virtual organizations and other structural innovations.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
To be able to identify the needs

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
and solve the problems,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
employees must be able to orient themselves

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
in what is happening around them,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
understand the organization's overall activity

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and also realize their place in it.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Therefore, each of them needs access

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
to data such as budgets,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
department expenses, revenue indicators.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Electronic communication is one of the most important aspects

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
of information exchange and knowledge.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Computer networks, Internet technologies,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
intranets and extranets

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
all contribute to redistributing knowledge,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
to presenting information to those

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
who really need it,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
to the constant contact between employees.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
However, a great deal of importance

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
is given to personal communication

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and, above all, to the ability to listen to each other.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
In traditional organizations,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
decisions are passed up in a hierarchy for approval.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
The right and responsibility of making decisions

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
lies with those who are closest to the problem.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
In traditional vertical organizations,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
top managers are responsible

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
for the development of the strategy,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and those who have the necessary knowledge and experience

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
to manage the company.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
The leaders of the learning organization

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
also influence the vision, direction and formulation of the strategy,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
but not only them.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Everyone participates in the strategic process.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Information is collected by those

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
who directly contact buyers, suppliers,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
other organizations.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
It is they who recognize changes,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
identify needs and find solutions,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and then offer their ideas

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
to other members of the organization for discussion.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Another forming strategy of the learning organization

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
can be partnership relations

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
with suppliers, buyers and even competitors.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
With other companies,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
the learning organization sets relatively permeable boundaries,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
which opens access to information

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
about new strategic needs and directions.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Instead of keeping a distance

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
from buyers and suppliers,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
the modern learning organization

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
brings them into the ranks of partners,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
whose efforts are aimed at achieving common goals.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
The employees of the learning organization

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
are endowed with extraordinary powers,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
in particular, with the right and even the duty

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
to choose the ways to achieve the goals set before them.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Endowment with power or delegating

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
means that the employees are guaranteed

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
the obtaining of the necessary decisions

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and effective activity, freedom,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
knowledge and skills.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Instead of a forcible division of the labor process

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
into strictly defined, narrowly specialized tasks and operations,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
the leaders of the learning organization

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
sanction the independent conduct of the employees of the correctional services

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
in accordance with the development of the situation.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
The number of rules and procedures is reduced to a minimum,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and the right to manage work tasks

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
is assigned to those who directly perform them.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Corporate culture is a combination of common

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
key values, beliefs, knowledge and knowledge.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
It is the basis of the learning organization.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Corporate culture of the learning organization

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
encourages openness,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
lack of barriers, equality,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
continuous improvement and change.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Such an organization always moves forward.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Of course, there are no perfect learning organizations,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
but get acquainted at least with the experience of the company

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Sheprell Steel and in the course of the implementation

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
of the practical task number 7

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
formulate the basic values of the corporate culture

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
of the learning organization.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
What structure should be preferred?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Formal vertical hierarchy

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
or the one that promotes horizontal coordination and cooperation?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
The answer depends on the specific circumstances

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
in which the company operates

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
or the situational factors affecting the organizational structure.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Organizational structure studies show

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
that the choice of a rigid or flexible structure

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
is determined by such factors as

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
strategy, external environment,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
production technology and interdependence between departments.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
The correct structure is the one

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
that is most suitable for situational factors.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Below we will consider the influence of each of the four factors

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
on the organizational structure.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Research on the formation of organizational structures

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
conducted by Chandler on the example of the activities

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
of the 80 largest companies in the United States

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
shows that the strategy has a determining effect on the structure.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Changes in the structure follow changes in the strategy.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
He found that if the organization is not able to

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
follow the changes in the strategy,

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
the results are not effective.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Since the pace of change in the external environment is increasing,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
the enterprise should clarify its strategies more often

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
than it was in the past

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
to establish their compliance with market requirements.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
This means that changes in the strategy

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
precede changes in the structure and lead to them.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
The change in the structure is not a result of the organization's actions

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
but a result of the changes in the structure and lead to them.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
The management structure is more inertial in relation to the strategy

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
because the factors that affect the choice of the structure

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
change slower in time

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
than those that affect the choice of the strategy.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The slide shows a simplified continuum

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
illustrating the interconnection of structural approaches

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
and strategic goals.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
A pure functional structure

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
is the most adequate organization

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
focused on improving internal efficiency

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
by using resources

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
but it is not able to provide flexibility or innovation.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
On the contrary, a team structure

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
is recommended by the organization

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
whose goal is to increase the degree of flexibility

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
and accelerate innovation processes.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
A team structure facilitates the process of building

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
reorganization changes and a temporary response

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
to changes occurring in the external environment

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
but at the expense of less productive use of resources.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
The compliance of the environment and structure

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
is also a necessary condition for the effectiveness

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
of organizational activity.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
The situational interconnections between external uncertainty

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and the structural approach are reflected in the following slide.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
The relatively stable external environment

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
is the most adequate traditional organizational structure

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
with emphasis on vertical management.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
In these circumstances,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
there is practically no need for changes

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
more close coordination or increase in flexibility.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
The emphasis can be placed on specialization

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
centralized decision-making and wide-scale control.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
If the variability of the external environment is relatively large

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
the horizontal structure is more preferable.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
The structure should also correspond to the production technology.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
The technology includes knowledge,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
tools of labor, methods and types of activities

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
aimed at transforming the incoming resources

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
of the organization into ready-made products.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Equipment, staff qualification

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and work ethics are also related to technology.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
The organization should be able to perform

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
its tasks in a more efficient and efficient way.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
The most authoritative study

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
on the data of 100 British companies

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
on the interdependence of production technologies

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
and organizational structures

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
was conducted by the English sociologist John Woodward.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
The following basic structural characteristics

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
of the organization were analyzed.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Administrative leadership, control standards,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
and the ability to manage the organization
