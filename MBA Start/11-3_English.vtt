00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.320
One day, the Hajja was sitting in the middle of the

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.200
tea chain and drinking tea.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.480
The tea-gatherer approached him

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.200
and asked the Hajja to take this

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.580
horse home.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.160
What he objected to.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.140
I don’t know where her home is.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.800
You just lead her along the road, she

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
will find her own home, said the tea-maker.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.100
That was what Hajja did.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.780
He led the horse along the road and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.900
when she told, he forced her

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.800
back on the road.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.140
Finally, the horse turned into the yard and the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.840
Hajja turned behind her.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.280
Suddenly the master went out and said

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.980
to the heath, “Mr. How did you know

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.700
that this is my horse?”

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.180
What has Haja answered?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.900
I didn’t know it was your horse.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.780
I just drew her attention to the road.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.940
So I wanted to show you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.440
that Marxism is a science that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.100
shows what the path is, which the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.880
successful businessmen

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.100
go, what the road to profit.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.180
A little about Marx’s history.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.180
Marxism is a relatively new science.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.840
The term Marxism first appeared at the turn

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620
of the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.580
In the United States it was

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.260
considered as a methodology and organization

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.080
of household operations.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.760
Since the 1930s, Marxism has become

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.060
integrated into the function

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460
of entrepreneurship.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.700
This was due to the problems

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.760
faced primarily by the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.640
American economy.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.620
You probably remember that in the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.980
year 29th, the crisis broke out in

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.700
America, which was later called the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.100
Great Depression.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.240
It was the Americans who first noticed

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.740
that they learned to produce

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.480
so much goods, but that these goods

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.740
were not needed by society.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.140
The barge with grain was melted

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.280
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.860
And it is this depression that has helped

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.860
many businessmen to understand that

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.300
it is important not to produce what

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.880
you know, but to produce what you

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.380
need.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.500
And it is from the 1930s that Marxism

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.180
became the so-called integrated

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.600
function that unites all business,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.280
finance, production, and

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.760
human resources management.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.360
Since the 1960s, Marxism

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.460
has extended to such industries

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.660
as non-profit organizations and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.280
services.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.460
It is a new trend that

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.840
is very popular in

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.460
Europe but has not yet

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.700
captured the Russian market.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.220
Since the 1990s, Marxism has

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.080
been viewed from the perspective

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.340
of so-called ethical or

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.620
socially responsible business.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.760
The first problem a marketer

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.620
faces is the diversity

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.920
of definitions.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.220
In the scientific literature, some

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.040
scientists believe there are two and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.140
a half thousand, some claim that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.680
there are five thousand, some

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.840
claim that there are thousands of definitions.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.240
So it would be very important for me to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.380
understand what Marxism looks like in general.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440
There are four levels of Marxism in

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.120
the enterprise.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.000
The first is the marxism of products, the second

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.880
is the marxism of the company, the third is

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.420
the marxism of the executives, the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.140
fourth is the marxism itself.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.580
In English, it is called Marxism yourself.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.180
In addition, we face the fact that

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.220
we have to understand the context

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.860
of our business.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.060
Depending on where we work,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.700
we are more interested in

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.220
industrial marxing, famous

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.880
B2B, consumer goods

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.040
marxing, so-called B2C

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.460
marxing, services marxing,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500
public and charitable

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.980
marxing, or international

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.400
marxing.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.960
There have been many other Marxists

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.620
recently that are related

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.540
to technology.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.960
You’ve probably heard that there

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.840
is creative marxing, lateral

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
marxing, provocative

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.100
marxing, classical,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.400
competitive, strategic,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.980
tactical, programable,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.680
and finally socially

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.740
responsible.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.640
Some of you probably know the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.840
famous Kotler Driad, which states

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.040
that, among other things, in a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.520
company, especially in a small

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.280
and medium-sized business,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.000
we must take care not only

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.720
of classical marxing, but also

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.540
of internal marxing, and

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.200
of marxing of relationships.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.680
And finally the last.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.540
There is another aspect

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.900
of Marxism that today so

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.880
interests Russian entrepreneurs.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.840
This is actually the Marxism of

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.940
attracting customers and the Marxism of

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.920
retaining customers.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.120
Of all this set of Marxists, I

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.560
would like to focus on one thing

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.540
I have called Strategic Marxism.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.340
Unfortunately, in Russia, too little attention

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.380
is paid to him, rather referring

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.580
to the fact that there is no time,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.680
or wanting to get a quick profit.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.580
Strategic marxing is, in fact,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.980
what determines the structure

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.160
of our course – it is the ability

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.080
to segment the market, select

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.760
target audiences and position

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.940
your products and companies.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.560
A small preamble before we begin.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.860
In one of the kiosks at the Academy

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.220
of Economics, I bought a pen from the

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.860
Japanese firm Zebra.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.080
This pen is no different, except

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.900
that it smells of vanilla.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.480
And when a man writes a letter, he

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.520
hears that smell.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.700
The second pen, which, again, this

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.780
company releases, is also

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.800
very unusual.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.760
You can use different colors at the same time.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.840
But more fun for me was

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.240
the pen of the Japanese company

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.020
"Kakuya", which opens very peculiarly.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.660
Most of my students can

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.580
never open it because they

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.220
are used to opening it in two ways.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.040
Either so or so.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.640
It actually opens when it breaks

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.720
in the middle.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.120
This is what determines the success of

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.120
the company in many cases.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240
What happened here?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.300
Japanese companies have realized that

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.420
they need to segment the market, look

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.140
for new niches, and not just sell a product

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.720
and try to play with price or

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.660
advertising.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.980
Look at this slide.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.320
The first three definitions are very

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.760
important for strategic Marxism.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.040
The first is segmentation.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.180
In Russian, these two terms are used,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.700
although in translation from

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.460
English it literally means "segmentation".

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.400
But Russian-language publications are

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.500
more prone to segmentation.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.820
This is the division of the market into

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.020
small groups, each of which

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.700
requires a separate Marxist approach

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.480
or a separate product.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.640
We will dedicate a part of our

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.100
work to this topic.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.020
Next, the next step is the selection of

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.540
target segments, the selection of the target

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.720
audience, the assessment

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.480
of the attractiveness of each segment

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.860
and the selection of one or more

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.320
segments for development.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.480
And finally, the

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.020
last fundamental principle is positioning.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.320
So the segmentation.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.360
The famous Kotler definition.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.340
Identification of clearly identified

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.040
groups of consumers within the

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.260
market, which differ

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.420
in their needs, characteristics

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.180
or behavior, for the service

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.480
of which certain goods

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.100
or marketing complexes

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.600
may be required.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.480
I think this definition is very

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.900
important to understand.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.060
If you see different consumers

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.180
on the market, you need to understand

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.880
whether they need to offer a different

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.820
pen or treat differently to

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.620
make a purchase and they

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.560
use the famous 4P differently.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.180


00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.840
And to explain the importance of

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.560
market segmentation, I would like

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.100
to tell you a little about the prehistory.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.660
When restructuring processes

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.480
began in Russia, most companies

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.940
that were engaged in business

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.780
were inclined to so-

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.580
called mass marketing.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.860
What does this mean?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.100
There were three segments in the market.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.280
1, 2 and 3.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.400
People are rich and poor, middle

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.160
class, but the company offered

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.060
the same product.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.780
An example is the famous newspaper

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.360
hand in hand, which is still

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.240
being published.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.800
It offered advertisers services

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.420
on advertising, such as

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.320
real estate, sales of household

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.920
electronics, sales of cars,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.000
building materials

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.680
and much more.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.420
Unfortunately or fortunately, the

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.060
market has grown very dynamically.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.980
There has been competition in the market,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.120
and many companies have realized that

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.040
each of the segments needs their

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.760
own products.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.500
This is the basis of

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.920
differentiated marketing.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.540
What does this mean?

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.520
The company thinks that there are different

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.980
segments, and for them you need

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.280
to create your products.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.000
So there were masses of advertising

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.620
publications that advertised

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.500
computers, real estate,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.840
food, cars.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.940
And from hand to hand the newspaper begins

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.800
to experience huge problems.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.940
But strangely enough, small

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.680
often have to limit themselves

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.780
to the third level of marketing,

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.940
which is called

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.660
concentrated

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.700
marketing.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.680
What does this mean?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.680
I understand that I

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.580
cannot serve all markets,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.180
I cannot serve large and small,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.840
I cannot serve, for example,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.000
the gas or oil industry,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.920
and I have to focus

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.220
on one segment.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.500
This type of marketing is called

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.100
concentrated marketing.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.260
In conclusion, I can only

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.320
say that concentrated marketing

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.680
and differentiated marketing

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.100
are what enables companies

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.740
to survive.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.120
Mass marketing will sooner or later

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.580
lead to bankruptcy.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.760
To show you what segmentation gives

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.240
companies, I would like to take

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.360
the example of Johnny Walker,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.120
a famous whisky that is produced

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.500
in Scotland.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.040
Until 1980, despite its centuries-

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.760
old history, Johnny Walker was

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.180
produced in one form – Johnny Walker

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.440
Red Label.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.060
It cost £9 per liter in the UK.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.300
Despite its marketing efforts,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.680
the company was unable to increase

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.840
its sales.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.600
This market is very competitive.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.000
And then, since 1980, the company

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.260
has realized that it is

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.800
necessary to move from undifferentiated

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.880
mass marketing to differentiated

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.120
marketing.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.860
This is how new brands are created.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.400
Johnny Walker Red Label remains

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.040
the leading product.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.780
Then there are Black Label, Swing,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.540
Blue and Honor.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.800
Note that their prices vary

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.200
significantly.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.980
For example, the last type of

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.940
whisky is sold at £129 per liter.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.260
The company did not increase its sales

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.780
in deciliters, but it significantly increased

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.680
its profit.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.140
What did it show?

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.700
This showed that the company has

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.260
created that there are different consumers

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.160
on the market that need different

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.220
products.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.920
For example, for daily consumption

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.440
I can buy Red Label, but if

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.220
I go to the guests, I’m apparently

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.500
ashamed to buy a cheap bottle

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.660
of whisky.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.800
I’m likely to buy Black Label,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.020
but if I go to my boss for my

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.020
anniversary, I might want to

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.220
buy Honor.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.180
The advantage of segmentation can also

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.180
be reflected in the example

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.720
shown in this slide.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.600
Many airlines began to create

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.240
differentiated marketing, creating

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.720
in their cabin tickets economy,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.280
business and first class.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.860
And you will notice on this slide

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.320
that a mass company loads the

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.680
aircraft at a standard price in

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.220
the economy class, for example,

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.200
at a price of £250, it gets

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.640
only by filling the entire aircraft,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.520
only £5200 of profit.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.980
And a company that creates, for

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.860
example, differentiation within even

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.580
one aircraft, creating an economy,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.660
business and first class, earns

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.120
more than £37,000 in profit

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.080
on one flight.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.560
This is the key element

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.920
of why market segmentation

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.100
is needed.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.620
I have shown you a few examples

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.980
that confirm that segmentation

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.340
is a very important tool

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.960
for increasing sales.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.500
But in reality, segmentation

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.180
plays several other

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.140
roles.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.660
The first is that it affects

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.880
the company’s image, it

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.820
shows the company’s growth prospects

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.320
and, of course, it allows you

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.300
to focus resources deeper or concentrate

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.840
resources on the most

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.120
attractive segments.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.900
The problem of segmentation is always the

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.760
most difficult, because it is

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.020
not an intellectual exercise.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.860
Mr. Kotler, who loves the

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.040
trades in Russia, divides

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.580
the market into consumer

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.020
goods and industrial goods,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.000
suggesting that each market

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.560
has its own approach to

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.740
segmentation.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.840
If you’re working in the

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.220
consumer goods market, you might

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.600
like geographical, demographic,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.300
psychographic, behavioral

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.860
variables for segmentation.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.160
The market for industrial goods is more complex.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.080
Here, such factors as demographic

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.280
factors, for example, the

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.140
organization of procurement and individual

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.120
characteristics of

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.840
customers, are very important.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.420
It is this market that is considered

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.800
to be the most difficult, but,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.400
nevertheless, there is a certain rule

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.060
on how you can segment the market.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.460
My question.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.600
First, determine which market you

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.680
are operating in, and then answer

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.040
the question of whether

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.780
there are certain groups of

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.800
customers that differ in their

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.400
behavior, that is, show

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.160
behavioral homogeneity

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.660
when purchasing your

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.720
product.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.100
Let it be called a qualitative

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.940
survey, to find out if there

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.700
are among your consumers who respond

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.660
the same way to your martering,

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.640
or make the same demands

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.020
when making a

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.000
purchase.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.680
Now, let’s go to a small

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.920
practical exercise.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.340
Propose your option

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.820
of segmenting the retail consumer

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.680
market.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.380
When I ask this question at

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.000
many seminars, people try to

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.100
find the answer and offer

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.320
to segment consumers by

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.180
income, gender, age.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.940
In fact, it is not a very simple

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.680
question.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.940
And so, to go back to it, I would

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.720
like to show you that there

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.360
is no algorithm in segmentation

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.880
by which any person can, by

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.260
doing one thing, move to another,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.060
complete this process

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.400
effectively.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.820
This is the first step.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.160
And the second issue I always consider

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.660
on my programs is the segmentation

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.960
of one of the very famous

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.780
English companies Crystal

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.540
Clea, which produces lead

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.740
crystal.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.600
This brand of the company is considered

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.580
prestigious, and its products are highly

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.120
valued and purchased mainly in the

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.020
form of gifts.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.960
And, as a rule, in order to

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.600
show the diversity of

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.420
segmentation, these two examples

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.920
are very visible.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.360
Now look at the answer to the first question.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.000
See how retail networks

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.480
segment their consumers.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.120
As strange as it may be, two facts

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.380
are very important to them.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.340
It’s how often people go to

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.940
shops and how much they buy.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.960
And on this basis, there are

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.920
four main segments that are important

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.680
for retail chains, often multi-buyers.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.160
These are regular customers who

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.500
come to shops and on Saturdays usually

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.580
buy large carts of products

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.980
for the whole week.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.720
Often but not much buyers.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.280
These are customers who live near shops,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.080
they often come in, for example,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.920
grandmothers, students, but unfortunately

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.700
they buy little.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.120
Rarely but many buyers.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.040
People generally rarely come

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.380
to this store, a random

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.540
buyer who, fortunately, buys

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.320
a lot, buying the whole cart.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.280
Finally, a segment that

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.560
is rarely called buyers or not

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.520
buyers at all.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.620
With respect to each segment,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.060
the company must build its policy

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.460
and choose the means to engage

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.780
them in sales.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.960
Now look at the answer to how the

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.380
famous English company Crystal

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.260
Clea makes its segmentation.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.180
She figured on products.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.680
Usual gifts for various

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.120
anniversaries, retirement,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.360
birthday, romantic

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.200
dates, public holiday and

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.140
festival.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.240
The second segment is wedding gifts,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.520
when young couples start

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.100
to start with expensive dishes

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.500
for their home.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.620
Gifts such as money positioning,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.480
business gifts and presentations

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.100
to promote sales, and special

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.340
gifts such as prizes at

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.020
sports competitions.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.140
This segmentation makes it possible for

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.700
the company to understand the following:

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.380
if it is important to work with

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.180
retail chains for the first three segments,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.880
then direct sales are important

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.240
for the last two segments.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.290
I would like to show you the

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.350
segmentation of the Nokia mobile

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.170
phone market.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.110
Everyone is a Nokia buyer,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.330
and when we approach

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.550
the mobile phone stand,

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.790
we are unconsciously

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.590
the tool for

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.810
segmenting ourselves.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.450
Nokia has four groups

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.450
of consumers: style-

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.770
oriented buyers, image-

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.350
oriented buyers, businessmen

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.390
and practical-oriented

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.850
buyers.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.210
In each case, the company

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.990
offers its product, understanding

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.890
that in this way it does not leave

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.370
competitors a niche in which

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.490
it can work and make money.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.630
At the same time, pay attention

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.310
to this slide and tell what

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.990
type of buyers you are in terms

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.410
of Nokia segmentation.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.070
Segmentation in the impetus seems to

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.570
me to be the most difficult topic as

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.910
mobile operators today seek to

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:23.970
segment the market.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.350
I asked questions, understanding

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.930
that it could not be perfectly

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.830
segmentation, but nevertheless,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.950
by holding classes with different

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.690
groups of listeners, I was convinced

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.070
that most of them somehow pursue

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.050
the following goals, and,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.830
accordingly, may relate

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.750
to a group of segments, students,

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.010
are people who speak

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.310
little and pay little.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.890
The second group are young families,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.950
they talk a lot, but they don’t

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.950
have enough money and therefore pay little.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.330
Entrepreneurs, this category, is a lot

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.810
of talking, but the average pay and

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.570
finally are well-off, a lot of talking

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.910
and a lot of paying.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.910
A peculiarity of segmentation in general

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.450
is that when a marketer proceeds

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.670
with this procedure, he must understand

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.990
the following.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.810
It is important for him not only to highlight

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.710
variable segmentations, but also

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.490
to name his market segments beautifully.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.310
This culture of marketing, it

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.530
is, of course, different

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:22.630
from financial culture, or

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.170
culture, for example, human resources

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.570
management and therefore a very

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.490
important element is how

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.130
we call our consumer groups.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.030
If we look at the Russian

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.210
Internet, we will note that

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.550
almost all the photographs

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.370
of athletes are borrowed

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.150
from this magazine.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.070
If we approach, for example,

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.810
the segmentation of the magazine

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.850
market, there are a lot of ideas,

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.190
but, nevertheless, this

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.750
option shows how unsystemic

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.910
segmentation is.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.350
This is the firm segmentation

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.110
of this famous magazine.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.670
Those who want to have fun are

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:09.990
the first segment that Sport Illustrated

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:15.450
would like to satisfy with its

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.650
magazine articles.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.790
Those who need facts about sports

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.030
are offered reviews, statistics,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.750
biographies, collectors

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.710
of sports related items.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.590


00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.510
For this, the magazine publishes various

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.750
types of stories and tells about objects.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.770
And finally, those who need advice.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.990
Note that there are several criteria

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.670
here in segmentation, and therefore

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.670
it is very difficult to say

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.010
why the disease or other

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:45.930
are chosen.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.650
The consequence of this segmentation

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.990
is the policy of this magazine.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.930
See, Sport Illustrated

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.450
magazine, in addition to releasing

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.410
a magazine with

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.930
relevant headings for its readers,

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.630
also releases specialized

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.710
publications, materials,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.550
books, videos, children's

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.130
edition, and finally

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.210
organizes trips to sports events.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.310
What I wanted to show in this

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.570
way is that market segmentation

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.370
often pushes companies to expand

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.990
their service scope by understanding

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.950
what their customers are

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.390
asking for.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.170
Now about that slide.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.670
Per 80% of people who come

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.130
to marketing seminars in Russia

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.770
are people who, to some extent,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.630
represent the so-called B2B

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.710
sector, business to business.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.430
These are people who work in

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.250
the company and through direct

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.850
sales or work with customers directly

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.610
sell, for example, metal,

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.730
machinery, components and

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.030
much more.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.210
Often they ask how to segment

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.550
their consumers and what to

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.790
do in a situation when price

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.990
competition is growing.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.570
I always go back to this

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.910
situation and show this slide.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.470
The most important thing if you

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.810
want to get away from your

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.170
competitor and make money in the

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.890
conditions of growing competition

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.850
is the right segmentation.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:09.370
Nearly 60% of companies in the B2B

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.630
sector in Europe segment the market

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.790
in the following way.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.130
Those who are price-oriented, those

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.630
who are service-oriented and those

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.850
who are long-term relationships-oriented.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.450
This policy should

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.630
also be applied to Russian

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.650
companies.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.170
There are buyers in your company

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.350
who are very important to the price.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.910
And if you are going to offer a higher

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.450
price than the competitors, they

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.470
are likely to turn to the latter.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.470
And so you should understand that

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.650
if you think that segment is important

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.230
to you and you want to sell

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.410
it, know that for that segment you

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.170
need to offer a low price and a

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.170
minimum set of services and features.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.850
The second segment is the customer

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.710
who is service-oriented.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.070
These are buyers who are willing

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.750
to overpay if you are providing

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.510
delivery, training, payment

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.850
fee, or something else.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.750
Finally, the third segment, very

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.490
important at least in Europe,

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.390
is buyers who are focused

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.510
on long-term relationships.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.070
As a rule, large companies, such

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.010
as factories that produce cars,

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.990
household appliances, are interested

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.590
in making their suppliers reliable,

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.290
and in this regard they may

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.770
be less interested, for

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.250
example, in the price

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.270
in greater degree.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.490
How ready you are to produce the

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.030
first reliable, second quality

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.490
products, and how stable

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.630
you are ready to deliver these

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.710
products, for example,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.610
the envelope exactly on time.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.090
Look at this slide, I think it’

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.650
s very important to describe

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.890
segmentation in the B2B sector.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.170
This is a study by McKinsey,

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.850
steel consumers.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.510
Why do they choose how they

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.670
choose suppliers?

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.530
Note that McKinsey also refers

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.170
to the fact that there are three

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.430
types of segments in this

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.890
industry – customers that are

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.850
price-oriented, and services that

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:10.910
are long-term.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.150
And if you take the rating criteria,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.310
one non-important, four important,

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.030
four-point system, you will

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.510
pay attention to the following that

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.670
each segment presents its own

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.010
requirements, to the next each

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.390
segment of buyers offers

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.310
its own requirements to the supplier.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.250
For example, the lowest price

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.770
you see is interested in the first

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.110
segment, it is a price-oriented segment.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.110


00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.750
And companies, so-called, interested

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.490
in the service are more interested

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:43.210
in other aspects than the

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.730
valuable, and are willing

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.950
to pay a higher price.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.350
Note, for those who buy at a low

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.850
price, and in Russia this is

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.490
a mass of small and medium-sized enterprises,

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.170
for example, buying the same metal,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.730
are interested in instantaneous

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:05.230
response, timely delivery.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.530
To companies that are interested

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.210
in the first place service, it is very

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.330
important for them to immediately

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.930
respond, to make goods in

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.170
stock, timely delivery

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.490
and customer orientation during

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.410
the transaction.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.190
The following slide shows that

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.950
there are several other criteria

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:26.950
for buyers in the B2B sector,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.390
such as short delivery time, how

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.050
long products should be delivered.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.930
I pointed out that, for example,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.450
companies that are service-oriented

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:44.530
would like to receive these companies

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.830
with an interest in technical

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.550
support or, for example,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.890
industry loyalty, that is, manufacturer

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.550
commitment to that industry.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.110


00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.670
Pay attention to the following factors

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.630
of the company, for which long-

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.550
term relationships are very important,

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.190
usually interested in developing

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.890
their supplier, and therefore

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.890
important to them, how much the

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:06.950
supplier company

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.290
is interested in research, private

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.930
scientific investments in the nick,

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.550
whether it is willing to support

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:20.510
its supplier with various types

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.310
of technical advice, and for

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.930
her, of course, very important is

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.750
the loyalty, loyalty of this supplier

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.190
to the industry, namely,

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.390
how long you, as a supplier, expect

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.190
to work in this industry, or you,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.810
in any successful case, are

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.270
ready to leave this industry

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.070
and find the best application

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.790
for your finances.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:47.830
I would like you to ask the following

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.990
question, following the results

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.950
of this short lecture, if you can

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:58.530
describe the products for each segment,

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.550
what this means.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.870
Those materials that work spend

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.210
that are attached to our drive,

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.610
allow you to do the following,

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.310
first, try to select market

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.070
segments, second, you need to assess

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.730
market segments, you will see a

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.530
system of criteria that are offered

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.330
within my course, but very important

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.970
is the third aspect when you

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.470
do, for example, segmentation

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.450
exercises, you need to say

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.490
how the product should

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.070
look, product for that

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.830
segment.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.870
This means that you cannot sell

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.030
a single product in pursuit of

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:44.150
the objectives of mass marxism.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.210
Product for each segment

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.750
means not only a base product,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.130
but also a set of services

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.250
that ensure timely delivery

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.250
of customers.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.310
Please think about how you

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.110
design your product.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.570
A little hint, I would like you

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.670
to understand that price-oriented

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.170
segments will never buy a

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.110
product if the price is high.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.670
So offer him this product,

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.650
but clean this product from all

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.850
the loads that are only possible.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.090
Make it basic.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.810
But for segments that are focused

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.890
on quality, service and long-

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.810
term relationships, there

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.330
must be different products.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.210
This is very difficult to imagine for

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.730
a company selling, for example, metal,

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.810
which does not even see the difference

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:38.570
between having buyers from

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.330
the one and the second segment.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.300
A very important element of

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.220
market segmentation is the segmentation

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.780
of the market by income.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.760
More well-known in Russia is the

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.380
segmentation that Mr. Kotler

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.740
offers, namely he segments

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.300
consumers by classes, for

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.880
example, the upper class, middle

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.220
class, lower.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.540
In addition, each class has its

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.600
subgroups.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.380
I would like to say that Marxism

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.380
is very diverse.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.160
And, for example, here I am bringing

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.480
the so-called O'Corn segmentation,

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.300
which was developed by English marketers.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.240
Note that in this segmentation

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.940
there is also some division

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.760
of people in income according

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.620
to where they live.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.640
But yet, it is still very

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.020
important to me how marketers

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.340
call these segments.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.440
The traditional American approach

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.060
of the upper or middle class,

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.920
or lower, here breaks up into a very

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.040
creative name of segments, and

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.180
the successful people, 19.8%,

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.280
are expanding, their slightly

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.240
more than 11%, growing, stable,

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.380
aspiring and probing.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.180
I always ask my students.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.540
Tell me, please, where do

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.980
you place yourself in this segmentation?

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.140
Accord segmentation is very

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.480
creative because it makes it

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.160
clear that each group consumes different

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.620
products, reads different newspapers,

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.500
and visits different places

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.040
of rest.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.380
Final task of this course.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.760
When I say you’re doing market

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.600
segmentation, I want you to

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.400
be aware of the following.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.420
Segmentation is not a kind

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.900
of intellectual exercise that

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.860
allows you to understand that there

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.480
are customers rich and poor,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.780
there are large and small.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.940
Segmentation is a tool that

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.480
shows a company, in fact,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.000
to a shareholder often, how

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.560
we can increase sales.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.240
Therefore, I say that the

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.800
key task of this topic is as follows.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.560
Segment your customers

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.040
as you want.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.600
For this, read the textbook

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.320
or think about how it looks

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.380
in real life.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:06.620
and further.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.540
Formulate goals for each segment

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.880
in the context of increased sales.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.260
What does this mean?

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.140
What do you want from this segment?

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.540
Increase in sales?

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.480
Either keep current sales, or,

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.580
on the contrary, reduce sales.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.500
and the third.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.440
You must identify the key factor

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.680
of impact on this segment.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.760
What does this mean?

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.800
How can markfing influence

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.840
this segment to the

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.700
goal?

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.820
In truth, when I speak of this

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.060
approach to segmentation,

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.540
I mean that every company should

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.320
have its own Marxist policy.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.820
I once had to face an unusual

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.120
situation in Russia.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.440
One of my seminar attendees

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.040
came to the seminars and

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.960
said that her new CEO

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.900
had demanded a Marxist policy.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.940
He asked what Marxist

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.980
politics is.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.240
And looking in her eyes, I said

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.020
that Marxist politics is this

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.140
slide.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.000
Because your director would like

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.200
to understand if there are any differences

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.700
in the buyer of your products

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.100
and how the company affects

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.280
each of these buyers.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.240
And if this is not the task, consider

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.960
that you do not have

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.060
a Marxist policy.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.000
Rather, you have the option of

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.920
a household policy associated

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.580
with various types of stocks

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.660
and manipulations, range or price.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.060
You have no Marxist policy.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.730
The most interesting, I think, in

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.050
terms of analysis of the selection

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.790
of target segments, is the

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.310
model proposed by the Englishman

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.050
Dip Simkin.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.430
It is called the ABC method.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.810
This method is very unusual for

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.990
Russians because it shows the following

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.290
system of assessments.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.310
Every company has a volume and

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.110
sales in a particular segment.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.990
Sales are high, medium

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.570
or low.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.930
The company receives some margin from

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.230
selling its products in the segment.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.710
It can be low, medium, high.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.970
If you look at this slide, the

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.950
ideal marxing is when you select

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.750
segments in such a way that

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.310
the maximum sales fall on

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.710
the segment that brings

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.590
a high margin.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.750
And the minimum for the segment that

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.350
brings the minimum margin.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:38.610
This is called the ABC method.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.270
Look at the ABC method by Dip

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.230
Simkin.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.250
It is a little different from traditional ones.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.790
So the task of Marxing to select

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.210
segments A that bring the maximum

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.030
margin and ensure the maximum

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.750
sales in that segment, then

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.730
to find a segment that brings

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.670
the average margin and provide

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:06.750
the average margin, should take

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.810
up an entirely small share of

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:10.570
our sales.

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.950
Unfortunately, when we discuss this

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.490
model, at seminars I draw attention

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.270
to the fact that business in Russian

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.910
companies is built exactly

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:19.770
the opposite.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.630
It is a mirror.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.490
As a rule, the volume of sales

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:25.790
for products that bring the

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.290
minimum margin is maximum, and where

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.030
products are sold with a high

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.530
margin, there is almost

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.630
a minimum sale.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:36.450
Imagine this situation in this way.

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:39.310
I am answered, but differently.

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:42.090
And I remember a very funny

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.430
story that a student told

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:45.810
me at one of my courses.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.750
She said, buying expensive

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.710
and selling cheap is the easiest

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:57.530
thing, but learning to sell

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.350
expensive and buy cheap is

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.110
the art of business.
