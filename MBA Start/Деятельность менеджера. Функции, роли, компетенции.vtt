WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Good afternoon, dear colleagues!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
My name is Natalia Kormshchikova,

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
and today I will be with you

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
on the course

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
of managerial work.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I am a business coach

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
and have been cooperating for a very long time

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
with a consulting company,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
which allowed me to get a variety of

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
experience in managing staff,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
managing people,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
how to manage, what is managerial work.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
That's exactly what

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
we're going to talk about today.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
If we talk about managers in general,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
there are many categories of managers

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
who are engaged in various activities.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
This is a marketing director,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
this is a finance director,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
this is, say, even a master of the site.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
That is, you can talk about different levels,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
you can talk about a top manager,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
you can talk about a linear one,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
the one at the bottom level.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
But they are all managers, they are all managers.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
What unites them?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
This is what we will discuss today

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
in our course.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
We will consider several approaches.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
This is a functional approach

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
to the work of a manager,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
this is a role approach to the work of a manager

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
according to Henry Mintzberg.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
And, of course, what comes out

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
of all these approaches.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
That is, these are competencies.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Why will you and I be evaluated?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
By what criteria?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So that it is easier for us to navigate our work.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
That is, competencies are how we achieve

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
our goals, how we work.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
From the point of view of a functional approach,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
managers, coordinating the activities

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
of their employees,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
perform clearly several functions.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
That is, this is how

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
our work can be structured

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
as managers.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Andriy Foyol

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
at the beginning of the 20th century

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
highlighted several more functions,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
the most basic ones.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
That is, this is planning,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
this is organization,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
this is control,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
and this is motivation.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Or, as it is called in some sources,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
this is leadership of the staff.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Now let's define

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
briefly what each of these functions means.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Planning function.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It is clear that if we have not

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
determined where we are going,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
and we do not care at all,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
then which way we will go.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
We have no goal.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
We go aimlessly.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
We just chat.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
We do not achieve any results.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
But since the company exists

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
to achieve some goals,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
someone must clearly define

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
both the goal itself

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
and the ways of its achievement.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
So this someone

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
is the management staff.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
That is, we are managers.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Accordingly, the planning function

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
includes the setting of goals,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
the selection of strategies

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and ways of its achievement,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
as well as the making of plans

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
for integration and coordination

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
of different types of activities

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
and, accordingly, which employees

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
will perform these functions.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Planning is the determination

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
of the desired result

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
at a certain time in the future.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
This is the setting of goals.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
And we will now consider it in detail.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Determining intermediate actions

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
in the right order.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
That is, what do we do first,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
what do we do next,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
what are our goals that we set

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
from the very beginning.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Determining another activity.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Each manager knows

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
that we have a lot of current work,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
we are drowning in the routine,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
and, accordingly,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
when setting priorities,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
we also need to include

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
the activity that should be planned

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
at the same time.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
That is, planning is the tool

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
for achieving the goals of the company

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
both its own and its own.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And planning means thinking ahead.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
The tasks of the planning process

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
are quite simple.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Determine and clarify the goals.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
This will be the very first,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
the most important,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
the most basic

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
in the manager's activity.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Determine the limitations.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That is, what limits

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
we can fit into.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
This is, accordingly, time, resources,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
well, maybe something else.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Make a list of goals

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
that we need.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Specify the specific actions

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
or tasks that we must accomplish.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Arrange them in order

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
in which we must accomplish them

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
in order to achieve our goals.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Set individual,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
both for yourself and for each employee,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
group indicators of goal achievement.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Check the results

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
in accordance with the actions.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And whether we are doing

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
or not doing

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
the tasks that we need.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Whether we are doing

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
or not doing, whether we are deviating

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
or not.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
This is the task of the planning process.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Now let's talk about setting goals.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It is clear that the importance

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
of setting goals is related to the fact

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
that they are, first of all,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
the foundation, as I told you,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
for the management process.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
They determine ways to improve

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
the efficiency of the organization

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
and are, naturally,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
at the heart of any business decision

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
or management decision.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And, naturally,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
they serve as a guide

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
for setting specific plan indicators.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
If we talk about the types of goals,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
they can be divided into

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
economic and non-economic.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Economic goals can be

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
qualitative and quantitative.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Economic goals are expressed

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
in the indicators of economic activity.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
For example,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
it is the increase of the share

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
of the company's market

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
by 15% by the end of the year.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
A qualitative goal is

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
the achievement of the company

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
of technological production in the industry,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
which is also very important for the company.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Non-economic goals can be

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
set as, for example,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
improving the working conditions.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
These are goals

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
aimed at

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
improving the social conditions

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
of our employees

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and for their comfortable work

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
and for them to achieve

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
the results we want

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
in such comfortable conditions.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Shareholders may be,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
for example,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
dissatisfied with the fact

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
that the organization increases

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
the costs of the re-equipment of the workshop

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
and the improvement of the working conditions.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But all these costs are justified

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
because people are the most important

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
factor in the success of the organization

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
and today it is one of the main

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
reasons why non-economic goals

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
should be set for the company.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
In order to know

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
where to go,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
there is one of the tools.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
These are Smart goals.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Now we will see in detail what it is.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Smart is an abbreviation.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We will go through each letter.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
The first letter is S.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Specific.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It means specific goals.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
What does it mean?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
It means that the result of the goal formulation

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
should be an answer

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
to the question

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
what needs to be done.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
The goal should not contain words

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
that do not carry any

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
meaningful load.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
For example,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
optimal, worthy.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Because every person

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
or every employee

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
has their own criteria

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
for determining the optimal or worthy.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Therefore, these words

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
should not be used in the goal.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The goal should be formulated

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
in such a way that employees

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
cannot interpret this goal

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
individually.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
The next letter is M.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Measurable.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
It means

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
the presence of criteria

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
that will allow us to determine

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
the degree of the goal.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It is about

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
quantitative measurability.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
We need to operate

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
with numbers.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
If we are talking about a qualitative goal,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
then a technical task

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
should be applied to the goal formulation.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
It will describe in great detail

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
what we need to achieve,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
how we will measure

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
that we have come here,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
how we will measure

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
that we have already done it.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
In practice, such criteria

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
are most often used.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Percentages or ratios.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
For example, these are external standards.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Here, they can also be measured

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
in quantity.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
If the level of the service is increased,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
then the criteria will be

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
the presence of positive customer reviews

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
and a certain number

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
of these customer reviews.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Some average indicators.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
For example, if the goal is

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
to maintain efficiency of work,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
then, as a benchmark,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
we use the standard of similar industries,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
production,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
let's say,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
in the same area,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
or standards of quality of other companies.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Time.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
When you need to get a result

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
in a certain amount of time.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
For example, in a year, in a quarter,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
in a month, in five years, in a week.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
We also set

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
time frames here.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Prohibitions.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
This is a very specific criterion.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
If we need to minimize,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
for example, the percentage of marriage,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
accordingly, as one of the criteria,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
these are prohibitions.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Corporate standards.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
If the company meets

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
specific standards

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
for the performance of work,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
then the criteria will be the performance of standards.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Let's say, if we have

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
five of these standards,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
then the performance of all five standards

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
is the performance of a standard document.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
The next letter is

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
A.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Achievable.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
To achieve the goals,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
the manager should take into account

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
professional and personal qualities

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
of the subordinates.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
At the same time,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
the target bar should not be lowered

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
while keeping a rather tense rhythm of work.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
There are several ways

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
to set this bar.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
The first way

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
is to raise the bar.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
The manager,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
having raised the bar a little,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
looks whether the employee is prepared

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
for higher requirements

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
or not.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
If he is prepared,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
then we move this bar even higher

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
when issuing the next task,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
when setting the next goal.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
This option is very suitable for beginners

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
who have just joined our company,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
or employees who have just

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
faced the implementation of this task for the first time.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Here we first set

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
the test goal,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
then we raise the bar,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
raise and raise

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
so that the employee can grow

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
and gain confidence in his own strength.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
The second option is to set

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
such a goal

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
that will require the employee

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
to increase the results of the work

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
that are still far from

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
his limited capabilities.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
This is already suitable for experienced specialists

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
who do not seek to stand out

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
and do not look for novelty.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Thanks to this approach,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
they will not feel oppressed

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
due to excessive requirements,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
and at the same time they will be able to increase

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
their results.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
The third option

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
will require a significant increase

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
in results and

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
get closer to the limited capabilities

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
of our employees.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It is suitable for initiative, experienced employees

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
who want to achieve more

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
and are ready to work

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
in a tight mode.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
The fourth option is

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
an even higher bar,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
which is suitable for very ambitious

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
employees who seek

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
to achieve high results

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
and they never stop

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
at the achieved one.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
These employees will work with great pleasure.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
But at the same time, we must take into account

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
the traps that we can fall into,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
and, accordingly, we must watch our employees.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
If you draw it in this format,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
here is the level of difficulty

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
in setting the goal.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And if this is the level of the employee

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
at which he is,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
that is, the level of his competence,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
the level of his knowledge, his skills,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
then, accordingly,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
if we put the task

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
lower than he can

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
actually do,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
accordingly,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
a person begins to perform,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
this work becomes routine for him.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
He starts doing some things,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
but he knows that he is capable of more.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
He can do much more.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Accordingly,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
how does this employee behave?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
This zone can be called

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
the zone of petty filth.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Why petty filth?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Because a person is not interested in working.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
He does the same thing,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
so what?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
He does not think about how he will perform this task.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
He does not start to load himself

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
with some other tasks.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
He does not take on more.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
He is tired of it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
He does not follow the employees.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
He starts to perform his work, let's say,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
poorly.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Why petty filth?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
He starts to be filthy, roughly speaking.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
The next zone.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
If we give the employee

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
a task

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
in accordance with his professional level,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
that is, this is exactly where

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
our red line passes,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
then this zone can be called the zone of pleasure.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
The employee does not work for us.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
He enjoys it.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And at the same time he achieves the goals

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
that we have set for him.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
But what happens?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
If he constantly performs

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
this work,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
he has already learned

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
two or three times,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
accordingly,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
his competence remains here

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and he goes to the zone of petty filth.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
That is, work for him

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
becomes routine again.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And this must be taken into account

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
when performing tasks.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
The next option

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
is when we give the employee

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
a task

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
as in the first case

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I told you about.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That is, a gradual increase.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
That is, we give the task

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
a little higher than his ability.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
This zone is called the zone of pleasure.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
What can be said about this zone?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
This zone is very interesting.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That is, a person was given

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
a little more than he is capable of.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Accordingly, he understands

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
that he was entrusted.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
He will be motivated.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
He will be happy to do this job.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
But when he did this task

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
once, twice,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
he goes down

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
to the zone of pleasure.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
While he is still satisfied,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
he is motivated, he works with pleasure.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
But then he can go down

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
to the zone of petty filth.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And this, again, we need to take into account.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
One more point about the stretch zone.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
If we constantly give a person

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
a task higher than his ability

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
and capabilities,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
then he will constantly

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
work in a stretch zone.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And when we are in a stretch zone,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
then, accordingly,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
it is stress,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
it is, again, dissatisfaction with the work.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And, accordingly,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
a person can break down.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Therefore, here, according to the tasks

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
and goals that we set for our employee,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
we also need to vary.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
For example, we gave him a task

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
to go to the zone of pleasure.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Then we see that he has already learned it.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
We give him a task again,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
where he is in a stretch zone.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
That is, we do not stretch him constantly,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
but periodically.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Then our person will be very satisfied,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
he will work with great pleasure

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
and be, let's say, more often in the zone of pleasure.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
We also have the next zone.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
This is the last one.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It is also called very interesting.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
My house on the edge.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Initially, we set tasks for a person

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
that are much more than his abilities.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And what he can do and do.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And, accordingly, we do not give him

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
powers,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
those that are necessary.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
We do not give him resources.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
The task becomes simply impossible.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
What can our employee do?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
He may not start performing this task at all.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That is, he will behave

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
like my house on the edge.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I am not interested in this.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I do not need this.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
The person will not be satisfied,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
the goal will not be achieved,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
the task will not be completed.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And we need to take all these zones into account

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
when setting tasks and setting goals

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
for our employees.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Very often managers ask

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
how long can you hold an employee

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
in a particular zone.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Naturally, this is a purely individual question.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Because the degree of training

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
of employees is also completely different.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Here you need to show your talent

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
of penetration to the manager,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
which he must also have.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Partly.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
The next letter is R.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
This is relevant.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
It means that the goals must be agreed.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Sometimes they are also called significant.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
The agreement of the goal

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
is determined by the answer to the question

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
whether it is important for the goals

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
of a higher level.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
That is, how much the goal of my unit

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
or my own

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
is related to the goals,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
that is, how relevant it is

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
to the goals of a higher level,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
to our strategic goals of the company.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Accordingly,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
having formulated the answer clearly,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
the manager will be able to correctly

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
emphasize the goals

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
to his employees.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
For example,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
a person is instructed to make a report

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
with the sales statistics of the product.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
If you do not explain

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
why this report is needed,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
and this report is needed

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
to make a portrait of the consumer,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
to analyze the dynamics of sales

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
or for something else,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
but for all these three aspects

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
absolutely different data is needed

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
that will include this report.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Accordingly,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
a person must be explained

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
why this report is needed,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
when we set a goal for him.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Therefore,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
when setting goals,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
the manager must necessarily

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
establish its connection

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
to the goal of a higher level

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
and explain it to his employee.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The next letter is the letter T.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
This is, of course, clear.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
This is time-based,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
that is,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
goals tied to time.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
What period,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
what time we must reach

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
what we described above.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
That is, a specific period.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Otherwise, we may have a risk

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
that this goal

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
is never possible to achieve.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
For example,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
to complete a task

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
within 30 days,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
to achieve a sales volume

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
of $ 1 million by the end of 2007.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
2007 will be

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
a time-based connection.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Advantages.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Advantages of setting goals in SMART format.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Advantages are

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
specificity, written,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
it motivates.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
A person understands what to do,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
how to measure his results,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
how it will be tracked.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Accordingly,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
it is easier to achieve a large goal,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
let's say,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
to achieve a sales volume of $ 1 million

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
by the end of 2007.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Such a goal is easier to break

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
for the task.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Let's say, in the first quarter

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
it will be $ 250,000,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
in the second $ 250,000,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
in the third $ 254,000.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Again, it is easier to track the result.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
But what are the restrictions here?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The goal is set on a chosen path.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
It immediately drives us

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
into the framework.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
We can't take a step to the left or to the right.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Everything is so clearly written

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
that in changing conditions,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
and the external environment

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
changes very often,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
very quickly, dynamically,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
we can't go beyond the framework

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
of this goal.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
And this goal is not suitable

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
for global and long-term tasks.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Let's say, a period of 5-10 years

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
is the period when we draw

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
or describe the vision of our company.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Accordingly,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
the rules of setting goals,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
if we summarize a little

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
the block on setting goals,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
the goal should be specific,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
the difficulty of tasks

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
in the range from medium to high,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
in accordance with the level

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
of training of our employees,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
the employee should perceive the goal,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
he should take it upon himself,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
and subordinates

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
through feedback

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
receive information about their progress,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
that is, how they move,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
whether they achieve it or not.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And the situation when an employee

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
participates in setting tasks,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
when we ask him about it,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
it is much more preferable

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
when an employee is appointed.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Because in this case,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
the employee perceives it

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
as his own idea,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and his own action

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
is always closer to him.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Therefore, it is a great pleasure

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
to achieve, to perform

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and to do something for them.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
What mistakes are there

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
when setting goals?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And what should we take into account?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Ignoring the strategic goal.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
For example,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
in many companies,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
the advantage is given

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
to tactical goals,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
and strategic goals are often forgotten.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
For example,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I will give an example of a tactical goal,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
and then a strategic one.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
In a tactical,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
in a short range,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
what can a goal look like?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It is to speed up the pace of growth of profit.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Although,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
in fact, it is much more profitable

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
for a company,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
much more strategic, let's say,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
to increase the share of the market.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
This will be a strategic goal.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
To increase profitability.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
This goal is more minor.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
To improve the quality of products and services,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
or to take care of the company's reputation.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
This is already a strategic goal.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It is higher.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
To increase the volume of money

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
received.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
This is again a tactical goal.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And we should never forget

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
that we have strategic goals

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
and we should set them too.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Negative goal formulation.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
This mistake

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
also happens very often

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
when we set a goal

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
for our department or for our employees.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
It makes us

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
negative at once.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
To correct mistakes.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And this is purely moral,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
not very convenient and not very pleasant.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
For example,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
a negative goal formulation

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
will look like this.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
To minimize the market

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and to minimize the market.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And what will it sound like in a positive format?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
The same goal.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The results of the achievement will be the same,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
only the pleasure will be different.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
In a positive sense,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
it will look like to develop

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
and apply risk management procedures.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
That is, you don't need to put a negative

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
right away in the goal formulation.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
The next example.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
To reduce the number of delays

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
for the work.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And if our employees

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
live very far from our company

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
and they are late

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
because of this,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
then the goal can look like

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
to allocate transport

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
for the delivery of employees.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Of course, for a certain period of time.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
To reduce the number of advertisements.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Again,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
a negative formulation.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
A positive one.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
To improve the quality of the produced product.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Here, too,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
it is necessary to combine

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and formulate goals not in a negative format,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
but in a positive one.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
That is, in an achievable one.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So that people strive to achieve something.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
A vague goal formulation.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
We have already talked about this.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
When we talked about specificity.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And very often

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
there are such formulations

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
as to increase efficiency,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
to improve labor discipline,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
to become a market leader.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
On the one hand,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
to become a market leader

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
sounds very positive.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But the question is

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
what is the point of being a leader?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Leaders can be different.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
For example, you can be a leader

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
in delaying work.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Here it is necessary

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
not to blur, but to specify.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
So that there is no double interpretation.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And when the goal is blurred,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
goals look unattainable.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Officially stated goals

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and the next mistake

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
when setting goals

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
do not correspond to reality.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
For example,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
the company can set

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
its goal of work as follows.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
We must love our client.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And the boss of one of the departments

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
of this company

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
is not even going to react

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
to incoming advertisement.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Accordingly, here the officially stated goals

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
do not correspond to reality.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And the boss of the department

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
is talking about this goal.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
He constantly says that we must love our client,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
but at the same time he does not pay attention

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
to the advertisements

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
that come from the client.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
So we have considered

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
one of the components

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
of the planning function

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
– goals.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Let's continue talking about planning.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
What else do we need to understand

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
in order to build

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
this process correctly?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
We need to understand that

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
there are three levels of management

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
in any company.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
This is the so-called pyramid.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
What is at the lowest level?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
At the lowest level

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
we have employees,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
managers, who are led

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
by simple specialists.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Accordingly,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
the third level or the lowest level

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
of the pyramid is responsible

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
for operational planning.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
These are the activities standards,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
the description of work,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
the description of possible

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
duties.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
This is the description

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
of the system

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
in which each of the employees

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
knows exactly what to do,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
how to do it, and at what time.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
The second level or the middle level

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
of management is

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
tactical planning.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Here managers are led

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
not only by specialists,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
but also by managers of the lower level.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Here we define

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
intermediate goals

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
in order to achieve higher strategic goals

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and tasks.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Tactical planning is very similar

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
to strategic planning.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
But where does strategic planning come from?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
At the first level, of course.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
This is the highest management,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
where the company's mission is defined,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
long-term goals,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
what the company is based on,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
what are the values,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
how the organization will behave in its market niche.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
The whole strategy

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
is at the top.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
But how can we better

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
plan from the top down,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
that is, from the definition

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
from the general to the private,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
or from the private to the general?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
The experience of working

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
with many companies

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
shows me that

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
when planning is done from the top,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
that is, when we lower the goals

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
from the top, the strategy of achieving

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
these goals is lowered from the top,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
then the lower levels do not work

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
very productively, because these goals,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
as we said above,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
are lowered from the top, they are not

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
borne by us, we did not give birth to them ourselves.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Therefore,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
it is better to plan from the general,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
that is, both from the top and from the bottom

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
at the same time.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
So, if we talk about

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
the tasks of the planning process,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
if we break them step by step,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
then first

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
we define and clarify the goals,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
strategic,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
mission, vision,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
you will consider this in great detail

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
in the course of strategic planning.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Then we define some restrictions,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
time,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and the number of people

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
who will be involved in the process.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Then we define

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
some restrictions,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
time, resources,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
technological, human,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
temporary resources.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Then we make a list of these resources,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
a specific list.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Then we write down the actions,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
that is, specifically what we will do

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
in order to achieve our strategic goals.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Then we put them in order,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
what we do first,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
what we do second,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
and very closely link them.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
What task can not be completed

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and how will be completed another.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Accordingly, the next step

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
is to set individual

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
and group indicators of achievement.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
And then check

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
the response to the results.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Everything is very simple.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Therefore, the biggest block,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
the biggest and most responsible

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
function of the manager

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
is planning.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That is, not so,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
let's act, let's do.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
First you need to think,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
put everything in place,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
put all the points on the I,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and then act,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
so that there are much fewer surprises.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
What problems

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
managers often face

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
when performing

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
this function?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Setting unrealistic цели,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
what we talked about,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
because employees start to behave like a mayakha from the edge,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
accordingly, the goals are not achieved.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
This is inactivity.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
We spent a lot of time

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
on the planning process,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
we wrote everything down in great detail,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
everything is so great and wonderful.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
But at the same time, we calmed down,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
everything, we worked,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
we made a strategic plan,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
so many points,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
we did such work.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
But then we do not work according to this plan,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
that is, without activity.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
And another very big problem

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
when performing this function

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
is the activity not related to the plan.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
When we wrote down the plan,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
we took all possible risks,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
which could arise.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Accordingly, we do not do

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
what we wrote down in the plan,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
but we do what is behind the plan,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
beyond the framework.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That is, activity not related to the plan.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So, accordingly, we did

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
the planning process poorly.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
This is also something we need to take into account.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Why don't our employees plan?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Or why don't linear managers plan?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
This is the lack of an idea

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
about the desired future.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
That is, people do not see

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
where they are going,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
they do not see why,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
they do not see the point of doing

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
the work that we are doing today.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
And even more so,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
it is still to plan.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
This is fear of being under control

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
or punished.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
If I write a plan to myself,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
it means that it will be easier

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
to control me.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Accordingly, employees also have

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
such a fear.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
What to do with this fear?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
You just need to calm the person down,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
that it will be easier for you to work

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
when it is according to the plan.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
If we deviate from it,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
then we will simply revise the plan,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
we will correct it.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Then the employees will not be afraid of it.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Fear of losing influence.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
This is a very common phenomenon in the company.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Why?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
When I keep everything in my head,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I do not plan it,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I do not provide it to anyone,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I have all the information,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
and it is all with me.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Accordingly, I am needed, I am necessary,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I am significant,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
no one can do without me.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And this becomes very important for the employee.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
If he transfers it all to a paper carrier

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
and provides something somewhere,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
where is it, how to perform all the actions,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
accordingly, the employee is afraid

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
to lose influence.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
What to do with it?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Here, everything is simple.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
The whole work of the manager

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
is done by the top manager,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
who works with such an employee,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
or by a manager who just works

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
with his employee.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Just talk,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
calm the person down,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
that we have everything here,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
if you suddenly disappear,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
then your work will not be in vain.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
That is, again,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
to raise the importance of this person,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
because this is very important for him.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Perhaps this is weak rational thinking.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
That is, a person sees this goal,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
sees where to go,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
but he does not know

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
how to rationalize this activity,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
how to organize this whole process,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
how to schedule it all

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
inside, according to the actions.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
So, accordingly, how to work with this,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
with this fear.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Here you just need to sit down

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
with your employee and say,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
let me help you, let's see,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
you are lost, let's see,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
let's do this, then this, then this.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
One, two, three.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
When you tell him, help him,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
help him systematize all this,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
accordingly, the employee will not be afraid of it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Well, such a banal thing,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
such a banal thing,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
such a banal thing,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
like just laziness.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
That is, a person is just too lazy to do this.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
What do our employees start saying?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I have no time, I have so much work,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
why would I waste my time?

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Here you need to show

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
the importance of the planning process,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
that is, how

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
rational we planned

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
it all, because we still

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
need to be effective,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
we need to achieve our goals

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
and achieve this with less

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
losses and less costs.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Well, accordingly, here

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
make, set deadlines.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
By this time you give me

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
a plan and we look further

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
together, how rational

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
it is all planned.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Perhaps an employee,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
this is another reason why employees

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
do not plan, it is not an ability,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
a person just does not know how to plan.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Again, what needs to be done?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
He just needs to be taught.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Everything is pretty simple.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
So, we set goals with you,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
we planned everything in great detail,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
we wrote down the resources,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
accordingly, what the manager does next,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
what he does.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
And then,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
this is one of the no less important

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
functions, this is organization,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
that is, how to organize the process,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
who will perform all these tasks,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
how to group

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
our employees

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
so that the work

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
is built more effectively,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
at what level will be made

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
certain decisions.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The organization function includes

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
or organizational activity

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
includes a social-psychological

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
aspect, that is,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
it is the definition of the type of personality of the subordinates

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
and, accordingly,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
the distribution of tasks taking into account

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
these types of personalities.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Why is this necessary? As we said above,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
the employee

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
is in the zone of pleasure

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
when he knows how to do it.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
He knows how to do it and he does it.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Accordingly,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
here, taking into account what he knows,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
what he is capable of,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
and setting him such tasks,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
or distributing the work in this way

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
and giving him this block,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
this task will be performed better.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
The second point is

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
the technological

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
component

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
of organizational activity.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Here is the division of the enterprise

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
or subdivision

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
horizontally, vertically,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
into functional blocks,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
that is, the grouping of labor.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
How can we divide all our work

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
into such blocks,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
so that it is performed better

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
and faster?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Grouping is the main means

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
of coordination of the activity

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
of our company.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
But this very thing

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
sometimes causes problems

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
with coordination between units

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and leads to isolation.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
That is, here the information role of the manager is involved.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But now

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
let's talk about grouping.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
The conditions of grouping

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
are the most important.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
It is the commonness of resources,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
as a rule,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
which the organization

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
determines on its own.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
There are two cardinal principles

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
of grouping.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
These are functional and market.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
That is, grouping occurs

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
on the basis of similar functional aspects

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
of activity

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
without being bound

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
to external factors.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
This is a functional principle.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
That is, what is inside the company

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
needs to be grouped.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
For example, by knowledge and skills,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
by working processes

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
and functions,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
by the time of the task.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
For example, the first shift, the second shift.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Here, too, groups are formed.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Examples of the main functions of the company

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
are sales and its stimulation, for example.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Purchasing and formation

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
of a product range.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Analysis and information

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
delivery.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
This is the analytical department.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Production of products.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
This is the production department.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Management of finances.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Transport department.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
That is, we group similar functions

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
into separate departments.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Market principle.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
In the market principle,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
the grouping of labor occurs

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
on the basis of similar external or internal organizational aspects.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
For example,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
we have a product line

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
or a brand line.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Accordingly,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
we group our company

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and its branches by brands.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Market principle of grouping.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Here, grouping occurs

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
on the basis of similar external or internal

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
organizational aspects.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
For example, by product.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
For example,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
juices,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
dairy products,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
drinks.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Here, grouping occurs in this way.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
By clients.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Corporate clients,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
physical persons,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
VIP clients, those that are larger.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
By geography.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Also, the market principle.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
For example,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
these are different regions of the Russian Federation.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Another organizational function

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
that is very important,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
in my opinion,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
is delegating powers.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Delegating powers

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
occurs both

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
on the basis of social-psychological aspects

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
of labor organization

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
and on the basis of technological.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
That is, grouping.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
What we were talking about.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
What is it?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Delegation is the transfer of tasks,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
powers to a person

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
who takes

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
responsibility for their performance.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Responsibility

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
is the obligation to perform

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
the task.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And authority,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
that is, the terms

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
we will operate with,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
is the limited right to use

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the resources of the organization

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and direct the efforts of employees

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
to perform the tasks.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Now we will consider the basic principles of delegating.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
The first principle.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
At the level of the organization

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
a possible volume or degree of delegating

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
powers

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
to managers must be determined.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That is, they need to be divided.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Delegated, undelegated.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Here,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
especially in such key areas

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
as price determination,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
assortment policy,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
strategy development.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
That is, it is necessary to determine

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
what we delegate, what we do not.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Moreover, for each level of management

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
we will have a list of undelegated powers.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
For example, as we said,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
the strategic decision-making area,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
the determination of the company policy for the first level

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
will be an undelegated task.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The development of tactical decisions

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
will be a delegated task

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
that we can delegate

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
to our second level.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
The next principle.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
We have already talked about it in great detail.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
It is necessary to clearly formulate the goals.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
That is, the expected result

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
of the subordinate's activity

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
in absolutely every specific case.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
If we delegate something to a person,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
we set a goal for him.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
The next principle.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Effective delegating

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
requires determining

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
the level of readiness and ability

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
of the subordinate to perform the task.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
This is the so-called

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
situational management model.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
For example, the level of readiness

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
of the subordinate is absolutely minimal.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That is, it is a beginner

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
in his activity.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Here the so-called

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
directive style of management

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
is applied,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
or the task is delegated

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
as a directing.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The leader himself sets the goal,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
gives detailed instructions,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
controls the process of performance of the work.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
That is, everything is as detailed as possible here.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
If a person has already learned something,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
has reached a certain level of competence,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
then we are already training.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
That is, the goals are formulated

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
together with the subordinate.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
You can ask him,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
what do you think?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
The leader offers

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
options and solutions

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and consults with his employee.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
What do you think?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I think to do it like this.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
What do you think?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
That is, the leader prompts

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
an independent assessment

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
of both his work

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and the upcoming work,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and the following is

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
seconding,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
or

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
encouraging style of management.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
That is, the leader

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
presents the employee with the opportunity

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
to formulate the goal on his own,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
the method of its achievement,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
only sometimes supporting it if necessary,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
not directing it.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And when we fully delegate

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
as leaders,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
the subordinate has absolutely all the powers

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
to achieve the goal and bears full responsibility for it.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
That is,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
he was given a certain section

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and he himself

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
independently makes all decisions.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
The next principle of delegation

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
is the transfer of authority

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
must be carried out

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
along the vertical line of management.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It happens very often

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
in the company

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
that one employee

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
or one manager

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
approaches another and says,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
our leader Ivan Ivanovich said

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
that you should do this, this, this.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And then

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
the same Petya Vasichkin,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
who must fulfill this task,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
becomes absolutely unclear

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
who authorized him,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
who he bears this responsibility to.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Therefore, here the vertical line

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
must be observed.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
If I start delegating

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
or I have a need

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
to delegate a task

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
to an employee of another unit,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
then I must do it

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
through the leader of this unit.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
The next principle

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
is the scale of tasks or the volume of responsibility

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
must correspond

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
to the volume of delegated powers

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
or resources,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
as we said.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
For example,

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
let's say,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
an employee is given $100

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and they say,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
you must organize an event

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
that will be on a large scale

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
throughout Russia.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Let's assume,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
a very exaggerated example.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
That is, the scale of tasks

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
or the volume of responsibility

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
must correspond to the resources

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
that are provided for this.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Also, when delegating powers,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
we must take into account the norm of governance.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
What is the norm of governance?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
It is the number of people

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
subordinate to one leader.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
That is, who I manage,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
how many people I can have subordinate,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
or the number of interactions

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
that one leader controls.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
The norm of governance

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
decreases when we need

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
strict direct control.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
That is, if I need to control

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
seven people,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
not together, but separately,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I will spend a lot of time.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And I will probably

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
not have enough time

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
for my main tasks.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
So, I should have

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
not seven people, but less.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
The norm of governance decreases.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Or I have 10 newbies

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
in subordination.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I can't manage them at the same time.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Therefore,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
the norm of governance decreases.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
When we have...

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
The norm of governance decreases

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
when we need

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
mutual consent.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
That is, I can't work

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
directly with an employee.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I can't contact him a lot,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
or with many employees.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
He is somewhere far from me.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Accordingly, I can't manage

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
a large number of employees

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
or a large number of tasks.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
The manager has

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
additional non-managerial tasks.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
That is, if a person

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
carries some social load,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
then, again,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
the norm of governance decreases.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
He either works,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
or he does some social things.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Non-managerial,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
not those that relate

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
directly to the fulfillment of his duties.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Accordingly, the norm of governance

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
increases when

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
all processes are standardized.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Everything is written down.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
We have clear instructions.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I can manage more people

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
than, say, 7 or 10.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I can manage 50,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
maybe 100 people.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
This is a similarity of the tasks

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
being fulfilled.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
That is, our employee

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
does the same tasks.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I don't need to control him anymore.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
He is already a professional in this.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Accordingly, if I have many such employees,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
then the norm of governance

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
increases.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
When I have many employees

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
who have a need

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
for independence and self-fulfillment,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
they know

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
how to do it, what to do.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
There are some points of control.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I have many such employees.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
They know

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
what to do.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
The norm of governance increases.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Another principle of delegation

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
is that the authority is delegated

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
to the position, not to the individual.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Many companies

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
also face this problem.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
When we have a person

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
who is very charismatic,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
very bright,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
and we need to hold

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
some event.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
We immediately think

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
about him.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Masha Ivanova does it very well.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
But she is not

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
assigned to this.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
We think,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
how would she do it well?

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
A person starts to do

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
not the activity

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
that leads to the goal of the company.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
The company loses something.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
The authority should be delegated

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
not to the individual,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
not to Masha Ivanova,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
but to the position.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
We should have a cult, a mass,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
a founder who will organize

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
all such events.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
We will gain it in accordance

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
with the requirements of the position

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
that we will write.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
The next principle of delegation

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
is the responsibility

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
The responsibility without authority

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
cannot be delegated.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I will do it all,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I will make decisions,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I will have all the resources,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
and you will be responsible

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
for all this.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
This should not be in the company

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
when delegating.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
The authorities should be

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
accepted by the subordinates.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
The employee to whom we delegate

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
some responsible task

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
should agree

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
that he will do it.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Yes, I can do it.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
This principle says about it.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Another very important principle

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
is the constant control

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
of the implementation

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
of the subordinate delegated function.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
The control points should be defined.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
What should be these points?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
How to control?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
We will talk about it

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
a little later.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Why do the managers

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
not want to delegate?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Very often we come across

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
such an opinion or a mistake.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I will do it better,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
faster, easier.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Accordingly, I start to get

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
into routine tasks,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
and my strategic goals

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
or the purpose of my position

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
start to suffer.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
This is one of the mistakes.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
The next desire is

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
the lack of ability to lead.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
It is effective

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and clear to set tasks to subordinates.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I need to grow up here,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
to develop myself.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
This is the zone of my growth.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
The lack of trust to subordinates.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I do not trust them.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I will constantly check them.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I delegate this task to them,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
and then I will check it 30 times.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Either they will not cope,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
they will not be able to do it.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
First, it demotivates

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
our employees.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Secondly, we overwhelm ourselves

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
with routine and do not fulfill

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
our tasks.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
We become ineffective.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Fear of risk.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
What if our subordinates

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
will not cope with the time

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
allocated for this task?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Accordingly, I am afraid.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
I do not delegate this task.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Again, I do it on my own.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
In order not to be afraid

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
that the task will fail,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
there is a very good way out.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
We set deadlines

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
with a little margin

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
in order to help our subordinates

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
or to do it on our own

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
if they fail.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
The lack of choice control

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
is also one of the misconceptions.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
The managers do not control

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
the execution of the task

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
when it is still in process.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
There is such a desire,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
such a mistake among managers.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Why do I do this?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I do not want to do it.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I do not want to be a burden

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
on my subordinates.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Why do our employees

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
not want to take

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
the authority?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Why do they not want to make decisions

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
or to perform tasks?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
A subordinate may refuse

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
responsibility.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I know it,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I know it,

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
but I am afraid to answer for it.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Again, we need our support here.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
A subordinate is afraid of criticism

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
for a mistake.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
A person is afraid

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
that he will be punished

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
for his mistake.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
We will talk about it later.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
How to give feedback

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
to your employees?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
A subordinate does not have

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
the necessary information

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
and resources for successful

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
task execution.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
You can take this information

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
here, in this database.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
You can take Tatiana for this,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
you can take Oksana for this,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
for your help.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
A subordinate does not have

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
self-confidence.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
It may be absent for the reasons

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
we have mentioned above.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
A subordinate does not have positive

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
incentives to take additional responsibility.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
It means that

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
the company does not have enough motivation

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
or the motivation scheme is not well-developed.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
We understand what we need to do.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
We need to see

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
how our subordinates are motivated.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Here we are

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
moving to

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
a very important

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
manager function.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
It is motivation.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
What is it?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Motivation

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
is a function of management.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
It is a process of creating

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
an inner motivation

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
for actions

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
in our organization

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
so that a person

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
wants to do something.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
It is related to delegated

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
powers, delegated

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
responsibility and

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
coordinated with a plan.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
An external motivation is

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
a motivation that is not related to

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
the content of a certain activity,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
but it is determined

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
by some circumstances

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
in relation to the subject.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
An internal motivation

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
is not related to

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
any external influence.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
It is a person himself

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
who wants to do something.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
As a rule, an internal motivation is closely related

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
to the content of an activity.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
According to Hackman,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
there are three conditions

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
for creating an internal motivation.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
It is what all managers

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
talk about.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Where is the button

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
for a person to do his job

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
with his eyes burning?

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
First, the performer should know

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
the result of his work.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Second,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
he should feel responsibility

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
for the level of the work done,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
for the quality of the work.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
He should feel personal

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
responsibility for the result

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
he achieves.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Third,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
the performer should perceive

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
his work as important

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
or necessary.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
He should understand that the result of his work

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
affects the life

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
and work of other people.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
It makes our employees

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
more important.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
The motivation

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
of the work

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
is measured

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
by the following five characteristics.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
They are the variety of the work,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
the completion,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
the significance,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
the autonomy and the feedback.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
The first three

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
are the variety, the completion

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
and the significance.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
They determine the importance of the work.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
The next one is the sense of responsibility

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
and the knowledge of the result.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Let's take a closer look

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
at the characteristics

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
of the work.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
The variety of the work is the degree

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
of the work that requires a variety of actions.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
What is it for?

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
It is for our employee

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
not to fall into the zone

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
of small filth that we have mentioned.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
A person has talents,

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
he has abilities,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
and we load him

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
with some very

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
routine work.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
That's why this factor is very important.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
The degree of the work

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
is the degree of the work that requires

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
and allows the completion

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
of a whole, clearly

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
distinguishable cycle of actions.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
There should be some points.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
A person should see his result.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
This is what the degree of the work

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
is all about.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
The significance of the work

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
is the degree of the work

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
that affects the life

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
of other people.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Our employee should understand this.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
The autonomy in the work

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
is the degree

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
of the work that provides

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
freedom and independence.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
The autonomy in making decisions

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
and choosing the actions

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
that we will perform.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
The feedback from the work

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
is the degree

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
of the work

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
that we will perform.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
The employee gets feedback

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
from the supervisor

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
on how he achieves his results.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Does he achieve them or not?

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
How well the work was done?

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
How poorly?

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
And what is very important

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
is that during the work

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
there should be those

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
rapper points where a person feels

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
that he is going in the right direction

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
or not.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
How to use this tool?

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
We take the formula

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
MPB

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Motivational Potential Point.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Each of the indicators

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
is measured

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
on a scale

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
from 1 to 5.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I want to say

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
that it is impossible to standardize

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
this process.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
It is a help to the supervisor

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
in motivating his employees.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
He can measure

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
how motivated each of my employees is

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and whether I can raise

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
this level.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Each of the indicators is measured

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
on a scale from 1 to 5.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
We take our employees

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Tatiana, Oksana,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Petya and calculate

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
the MPB for each of them.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
How varied

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Tatiana's work is?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
How much is it completed?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Does she see these results?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Are these points set?

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
How much does she feel

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
the importance of her work?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
How much is she

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
autonomous in making decisions?

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Do I give her feedback?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Does she receive it?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Do I pay attention

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
to my employee?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
How well or badly he works?

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Do I tell him about it?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
The task is for you.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
You will calculate

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
the MPB for each of your employees

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
and see how it can be raised.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
It is clear that the maximum rating here is 125.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
That is, everywhere the rating is 5,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and it turns out 125.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
When you calculate for each of your employees,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
sometimes such results come out

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
that 7 points,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
8 points,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
6 points.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
And the most interesting thing is

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
that there is no need

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
for any financial investments.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
That is, we increase the motivation

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
of our employees just by saying a word,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
just by changing their attitude,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
just by paying attention to them.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Accordingly, people will start

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
working more effectively,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
and again, we will achieve our goals.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Another thing I would like to say

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
in terms of motivation is that

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
each employee, different employees,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
let's say, have different types of motivation.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
That is, people are motivated

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
by different things.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
One of the types

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
is instrumental type.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
What is it?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
These are people who are very

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
influenced by external stimuli.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
That is, they need to be constantly

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
fed from the outside.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Roughly speaking,

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
not in vain we have a picture

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
on the slide of money.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
This is a bonus,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
this is some social benefits,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
or a social program,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
this is an increase in social benefits,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
this is some possible trips,

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
this is participation in some

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
giving out of subscribers,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
perhaps.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
That is, these are the things

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
that we can measure, give.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
That is, we can give that person

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
physically, somewhere he can joke,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
feel, can go somewhere,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
enjoy.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
This is an instrumental type.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
What will such people talk about?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
That is, how can we identify it?

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
These people will,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
as a rule,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
ask

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
when setting the task,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
what will we get for it?

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Will we get an additional bonus?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
What will I get for it?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
All conversations will go

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
around this.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
They will not be interested in the content of the work.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
What do I need to do for this?

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
They have the first question, what will I get for it?

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
The next type of motivation

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
is a professional type.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
These are very interesting

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
people, of course.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
These are people who are motivated

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
by the work itself.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
The very content.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
People like to grow.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
People like to grow professionally.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
They need less

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
some external stimuli.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
They just need to be given

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
more work

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
where they can develop themselves.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
That is, to expand their circle

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
of duties. They did

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
one job, then they did another.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Accordingly, they expand.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
They grow.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
This is a professional type.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What are these people motivated by?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
They like mentorship.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
They like to learn, they like to share

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
their experience, they like to learn

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
something new, they like to dig

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and improve their

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
process of work.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
People are usually directed

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
to the process.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
The next type of motivation is patriotic.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
These are people who are more

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
directed to the team,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
to achieve some high ambitious

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
goals.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
We are here, we are

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
involved in such results.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's like with flags.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Forward!

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Forward, you give communism!

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Mission, vision, the leadership

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
came down to us, wow!

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
They are already very pleased.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
These are people who can ask for advice

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and they will always give it too.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
With great pleasure.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
They will be very motivated.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
These are the awards,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
the honours,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
all that people with a patriotic

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
type like.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
The next type of motivation,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
you can't even call it a type of motivation

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
because these people,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
let's say, don't really motivate.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
They are Lumpenized.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Do you remember

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
the expression Proletariat Lumpen?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Accordingly, these people,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I am the same as everyone else,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
so that everyone has everything equal,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
everyone is the same,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I don't want to do more work

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
than everyone else.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
If I am given a task,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
why me, why not Vasya,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Petya or Fedya?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
These are people who

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
don't like to show off

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
and also don't like to be equal.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Everyone is the same, everyone is equal.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
This is the type of people.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Unfortunately,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
there are a lot of them.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
In my opinion, these people can still

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
be moved somewhere,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
you can shake them somewhere

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and transfer them to something else,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
that is, to feel the button.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But again, these are conversations,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
these are manifestations of needs.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Accordingly, then we will understand

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
what to do with this person.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
In life, there is no

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
pure economic,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
pure patriotic type of motivation,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
pure professional,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and so on.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Naturally, these types will be mixed.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I think that one person

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
will be clearly expressed.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Let's assume that a person is very

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
instrumentally motivated,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
he must pay for something,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
but at the same time he is still

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
interested in something,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
that is, at least he is interested.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The same is true of the host or the patriotic.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The host and the patriotic

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
very often happen together.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
That is, it is a joint achievement of goals.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I am involved in such a big,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
necessary, important,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
but at the same time

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I don't need to be touched.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I do it all on my own.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Now we have planned,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
organized this process,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
we motivate our employees

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
constantly,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
but we also promised to talk

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
about such an important function

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
as control.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
We don't like it very often,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
but we can't do without it.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Control is a process of

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
ensuring the achievement of the organization

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
of its goals.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Why do we need it?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We need it to find out

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
whether we have achieved these goals

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
or not,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
to stimulate

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
successful activity.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And another important thing is

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
to detect problems earlier

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
than they become too serious,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
so that we can take

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
some corrective actions.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
What is the subject of control?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
What is it aimed at?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
What do we control in our company

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
or in our unit?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
First, compliance

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
with any standards.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
For example, quality standards.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
The criteria for quality

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
are clearly specified.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Accordingly, we meet this standard.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The quality of the product,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
the quality of the communication.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
The next subject of control,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
what is it aimed at,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
is execution,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
that is, how we do something.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
If we have an activity in our company

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
that requires

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
a strictly defined sequence,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
accordingly,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
this thing must be controlled.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
The subject of control

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
will be the process.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
First, we do the first task,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
then the third and the fourth.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The most common type of control

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
is achievement.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
That is, the control of the results.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Achieved, not achieved.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And, accordingly, how it was achieved.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Three main types of control

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
are specified

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
by place and time in the process of activity.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
That is, at what time we will

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
perform the same control.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Very often managers forget

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
about preliminary control.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
What is it?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
We are just about to start

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
performing the action,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
we need to check if we have all the resources,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
if all the people are informed,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
if everyone knows what they should do,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
if everyone understands what needs to be done

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and how to achieve the goal.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Therefore, preliminary control is also very important,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
otherwise we may go in the wrong direction.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The next type of control

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
is current control.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
This is already here,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
in the process of activity,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
at the very point.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
How often we will set them up,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
we will talk to you now.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And the final control is usually based on the result,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
when the activity is completed,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
we sat down, talked, looked,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
achieved, not achieved, how much achieved.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Current control

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
is the so-called feedback.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Winter, Blanchard and Johnson

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
have developed a feedback technology

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
that they called

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
one-minute management.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
It consists of three parts.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Setting goals,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
we have already discussed it,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
praise of one minute

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and criticism of one minute.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
What is it?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Praise of one minute.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Employees should

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
at the end of each week

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
or at the end of each day

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
provide detailed reports

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
on the work done, successes, difficulties,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
what is the most important

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
or not least important,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
goals.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
For employees, it is another way

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
to analyze the situation.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
For us, it is to increase the employee base,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
including the person

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
has the opportunity to see

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
the results of their work

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
at a certain time.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And for the manager,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
it is feedback with employees.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
In this case, it should serve as a praise tool,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
not a indication of a shortcoming.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
What is it for?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It is not done to punish everyone

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
if something goes wrong,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
but to find out why it is wrong

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and to correct their actions.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And, accordingly, to praise

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
their employees.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The correct praise also has its secrets.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
First,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
you need to praise your employee

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
right after you noticed

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
the positive in his work.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
That is,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
he did something wrong,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and here, perhaps, he had some improvement,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
some breakthrough.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
We noticed it, we praised him right away.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We will not wait for a month,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
two weeks.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
We praise him right here.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Why?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Because the person immediately

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
gets in the mood, he starts working

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
with more enthusiasm.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Accordingly, we are good, he is good too.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
At the same time,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
it should be said that it was he who did well.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You do not need to flatter a person.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
What you noticed,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
what you saw in the process of improving his work,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
you tell him.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Prove by specific examples

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
that his successful work

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
benefits the whole company.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
What do we do with this?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
We raise the importance

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
of our employee,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
we encourage our employee

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
to continue in the same spirit.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Well done, Petya, go ahead,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
let's go on in the same spirit,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
we will reach great heights.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Find such words

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
that he felt this support.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And this is also very important.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
The excuse of one minute.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Our managers did a great job

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
in this.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Let's see how to do it better

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
or how to do it right.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
If an employee

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
deviates from the planned path

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
during work, the manager

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
should intervene and make a comment.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Let's see what the rules are.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
React to the mistake of the subordinate

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
right away,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
as soon as it is noticed.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Make a comment

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
in private.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
If you noticed a mistake

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
and there are many employees around,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
do not say this to everyone.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It is better to take the employee out.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
A person can have

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
a high self-esteem,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and here he can be so demotivated

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
that he will ruin

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
all the remaining work.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Therefore, it is better to do it in private.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
At the same time,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
do not remind the person

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
that he always does it badly.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
You did it wrong last time,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
this time,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
and here too.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Once and that's all.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Give the employee the opportunity

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
to explain during the conversation.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
If the task is not completed,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
if the plan is not achieved,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
then you need to listen to him

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
and find out the reasons

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
why it was not done.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Perhaps he did not have enough skills,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
perhaps he did not have enough resources,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
perhaps he was let down by other employees

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
who were tied to his job.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
This must be clarified.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
First, we need it to achieve our goals.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Secondly,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
the employee will be pleased

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
with our attention.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Make a comment or a reproach

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
only if we have checked all the facts.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
If a person is not to blame,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
if he is tied to another job

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
and he did not complete his task,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
then he does not need to make a reproach.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
He needs to make a verbal remark

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
and say that

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
if other employees are letting you down,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
you know that we are also

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
holding you back,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
tell me about it earlier.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
How do we make a correct reproach?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
The correct reproach consists of two stages.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
At the first stage,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
we inform the employee

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
what he did wrong.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Specifically.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
We clearly let him understand

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
what I personally think about this.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Then we pause

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
so that the employee takes the information

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
and digests it.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
At the second stage,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
we remind the employee

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
that we appreciate him very much.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
We can even tell him why.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Then we let him understand

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
that the reproach is over

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and we do not return to this issue.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
By following the rules of praise

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
and reproach,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
the manager supports

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
the constructive behavior

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
of his employees

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and motivates them

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
to make creative decisions

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
on the tasks they are faced with.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
We have talked about

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
the control function.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Let's see

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
what other stages of control

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
exist.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
What do we have to do in this function?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
First,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
we develop standards, criteria,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
and indicators.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Before controlling,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
we need to understand what we will control.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The second stage of control

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
is the comparison

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
of real results

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
with the standards.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
We constantly compare

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
indicators and standards

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
to see what we get.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
The third stage is

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
the adoption of necessary corrections.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
This is what the manager

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
is faced with very often.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
To sum up,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
what is the role

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
of a manager?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
It is a combination of actions

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
aimed at changing

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
or supporting the behavior

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
of other people,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
employees, subordinates,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
to achieve the desired results

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
through their efforts.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Through other people's efforts.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
We have seen

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
the functional approach.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
These are the four basic functions

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
that were highlighted by

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Henri Fayol in the early 90s.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
There is another approach,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
which is the role-based approach.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
There is a great researcher,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
a manager,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
whose name is

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Henry Mintzberg.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
He found it interesting.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
The functional approach is good,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
but what do managers do in the end?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
He started

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
his research.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
First, he came to one manager,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
then to another.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
He asked,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
how can their activities be structured?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
As a result of his research,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
he saw

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
that managers

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
sit, think,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
talk,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
constantly go somewhere,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
talk on the phone,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
write letters,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
look for information,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
participate in exhibitions,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
presentations.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
The work is

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
somewhat chaotic.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
From all the manager's activities,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Mintzberg

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
highlighted

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
10 roles and divided them

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
into three major classes.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
These are interpersonal roles,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
what the manager has to do

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
every day.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
He interacts with everyone.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
These are information roles,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
decision-making roles.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
All three classes

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
are interdependent,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
connected to each other,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
and, again,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
the manager's functional activity.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
This is

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
what gives the content

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
of the work,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
no matter the nature of the organization

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
or the position of the manager.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
This is a lower position

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
or a higher position.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
No matter what position he holds,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
he is a financier, a marketer,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
a producer.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Interpersonal roles.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
The head, the manager.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
There are three roles in this block.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
The head, the manager.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Very often, the manager

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
has to represent himself,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
represent his unit.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
This is a symbolic head,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
whose duties include

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
legal aspects,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
social aspects,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
ceremonies, actions,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
which are related to the position,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
to his functional position.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I, as a manager, as a head,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
represent my unit,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
my company.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I have to look

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
like a status person.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I have to speak

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
on behalf of

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
my organization

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
or my unit.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
The next interpersonal role

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
is the leader.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
There is a lot to talk about

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
the leader.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
We will continue to talk about it.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
You will see in one of the courses

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
in detail who is a leader

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
and what he should be like.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
He is a person

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
responsible for motivation.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
The manager is responsible

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
for the motivation of his employees,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
for the activation of his subordinates

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
so that people work

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
with pleasure and the actions

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
achieved their goals.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
The next role is

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
a link.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
The manager always

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
links someone.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
He provides work

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
to his entire unit.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
He links his employees.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
He knows what one person does,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
what the other one does,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
so he is a link

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
that owns the whole picture.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
The next block

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
is the information role.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Here the manager starts to act

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
as an observer.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
He is a person

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
who observes his employees.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
He is a person

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
who receives information

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
from them.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
He is a person who

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
receives a variety of information

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
from specialized sources.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
He uses it

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
in the interests of the case,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
processing mail,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
contacting,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
participating in conferences

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
where we receive a lot of information.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
The next role is

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
a guide or a distributor

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
of information.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I received it,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
so I have to broadcast it

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
to my employees

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
so that they benefit from it.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I pass this information

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
to my employees

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
from external sources

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
or from other subordinates.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
We pass the information

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
to external users.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
We act as an orator.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
We motivate our employees.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
We pass the information to them.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Why is it an information role?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
An information orator.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
We have to pass the information

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
to our employees

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
in such an interesting way

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
that they want to do something.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Or we have to pass the information

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
to our leadership

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
in such a way

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
that they listen to us.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
It is an information role.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
An orator.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
The next role

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
is related to decision-making.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
An entrepreneur.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
What does an entrepreneur do?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
An entrepreneur

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
usually

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
looks for opportunities.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
We usually lack resources.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Temporary,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
human, material.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Accordingly, a manager

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
starts to play this role.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Where to find something?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
How to minimize it?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
He acts as an entrepreneur.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
He often plays this role.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
The next role is a firefighter

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
or a violation-eliminator.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It is clear that not everything in our company

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
or in our department

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
is smooth.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Of course,

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
we have to put out some fires.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
There was a conflict

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
either because of resources

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
or because of misunderstanding.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Maybe something is missing.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Maybe something...

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
We act as firefighters.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
We correct actions

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
when our company

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
or our department

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
or employees

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
refuse to make important decisions.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
The next role

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
is a negotiator

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
or a negotiator.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Of course,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
you have to negotiate

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
in order to

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
promote some ideas

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
that we have.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Or you have to negotiate

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
with your employees

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
to make them fulfill

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
their tasks.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
We often have to negotiate

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
when we work

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
outside.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
We work with our external customers

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and stakeholders.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
We work with people

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
who are interested in us

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
and we negotiate all the time.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
We sell some idea,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
we sell ourselves,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
we sell our company.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
In a good way.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
The next role is a resource distributor.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
A manager

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
is responsible

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
for having

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
enough resources.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
It is a distribution

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
of financial resources,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
labor resources,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
and, again,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
the amount of money.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
So,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
what do managers pay for?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
They pay for

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
making decisions.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
The most important thing.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I made a decision.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
At the stage when we set goals,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
we need to have a certain courage

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
to set a goal.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It is either ambitious or not.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
At the stage

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
of planning,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
we make decisions again.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
At the stage of motivation,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
we make decisions all the time.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
When we control, organize,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
motivate, plan,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
the manager makes decisions all the time.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
To do or not to do.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
To refuse or to continue

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
doing it.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
What are the approaches to making decisions

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
if we talk about it briefly?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
There are intuitive decisions.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
A choice is made

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
only based on feelings.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I feel that it is right.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I feel it.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
According to the research

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
in Russia,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
most managers

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
make decisions like this.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Intuitively.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I feel, I think, I know.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I don't even know, I just feel.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Decisions are based on judgments.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
It is not about

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
someone's judgment,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
but maybe my own experience.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I have already done it this way.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I have worked once, twice.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
So, I can do or do

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
the same here.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The next type of decision

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
or the next approach to making decisions

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
is still a rational decision.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
A choice is made by an objective

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
analytical process.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
It is very difficult to say

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
which of these approaches

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
is the most correct.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It depends on the situation.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Sometimes a rational decision

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
if we approach it rationally

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
can take so long

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
that it will not be effective

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
or it will be unnecessary.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
If we make decisions

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
intuitively,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
without knowing the facts,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
we can make mistakes.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
So, decisions should be

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
made rationally,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
but based on our intuition.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
When making decisions,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
it is very important

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
not only to set priorities,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
what to do first,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
but also not only

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
logical analysis,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
but also courage.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Every manager

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
always faces two types of compromises

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
when making decisions.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
They are completely opposite

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
in meaning.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
The first compromise is

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
that half a loaf of bread is better than its absence.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
What does it mean?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Let's say we have a product

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
in our warehouse

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
and it is not for sale

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
at the price we set.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
It is easier for us

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
to lower the price,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
to get at least something,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
because money and finances

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
should work.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And it is more profitable

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
to invest this money in something else.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
So, half a loaf of bread

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
is better than its absence.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
The second compromise is

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
that half a loaf of bread

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
is better than its absence.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
In the first case,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
we have at least something,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
but in the second one

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
it is half a loaf of bread

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
is worse than its absence.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
So, we agree in the first case,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
but in the second one

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
we completely deny it.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
We do not start doing something,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
we do not take any steps.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
For example,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
let's say,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
we are in the CIS market,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
in the republic of our former union.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
If we do not have enough funds,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
we will not be able to cover

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
the entire amount of work.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
In this case,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
we will be denied.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It is one of the compromises.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
We will not leave

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
the market

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
if we do not have enough money

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
to continue our activity.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
What is also very important

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
in making decisions

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
is to remember the Pareto principle.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
80% of the information

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
we get from 20% of the sources

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
that are necessary for our work.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Accordingly,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
when we play the role of an information manager,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
we also need to look

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
whether this source is useful

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
or not.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Because 80% of the sources

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
will be useless information.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Therefore,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
when we make priorities,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
whether to go to a conference

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
or not,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
whether to receive this information or not,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
we need to think about it.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
80% of the decisions

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
are made in 20% of the time

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
that you spent on meetings

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
and planning.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
The same is true here.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Here you just need to optimize

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
the time of the meetings.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Accordingly,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
only the most important decisions

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
will be reflected.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
20% of your working time

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
is provided by

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
80% of our production work.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
In fact,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
20% of our working time

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
is made by

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
80% of our work,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
which brings us results.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
So, we have seen

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
what a manager should do.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Now the question is

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
what he should be like,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
what he should know,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
and how he should do it.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
What should he devote more time to?

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
What parameters,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
what criteria

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
should be used

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000

What should be the main criteria

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
It is team management.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
problems, when we need to

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
develop a solution.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
It is a strategic meeting,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
which is held

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000

that is, we need to solve a problem.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
We have managers,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
specialists,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
a certain project group.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
We, as managers, need to know

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
how to manage it.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
We need to know the life cycle of the project,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
how the team functions.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Here, a whole block

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
of skills that we should

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000

How to manage the internal and external

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
environment of the organization?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
What laws are in effect here?

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000

in practice,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
in the life situation of our organization?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
It is business processes management.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
How to build

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
a structure in our company

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
in terms of processes, functionality,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
how to manage all these things.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
It is motivational programs,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
which will affect the whole organization,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
the whole company,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and what role we will play in it.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
The next block is organizational development skills.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
The external environment is changing,

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and, accordingly,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
our company, our organization is changing.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
How to group our company better?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
How to plan better?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
How to go through this process better?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
It is strategic planning.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It is marketing planning.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
What will we sell on the market?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Is it necessary for the market?

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
At what price will we do it?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Where?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Where are the distribution points

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
of our products?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
It is also necessary to know and to know.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
The next block is strategic leadership.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
What role

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
or what place

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
our company will take

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
on the market?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It is strategic leadership.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Will we strive for it?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Or will we take

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
our market niche

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
and try to

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
lead here?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Or will we be a global corporation,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
which will cover the whole world?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
The management of organizational culture

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
or so-called corporate culture

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
also has its own

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
certain laws,

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
certain

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
certain trends,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
which we need to take into account,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
so that the organizational or corporate culture,

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
as it is also called,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
works for us,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
not against us.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And, as I said,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
our company will definitely change,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
because everything around is changing.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And, accordingly,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
something needs to be changed inside the company.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Accordingly, we must

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
know how these processes

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
are going on inside,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
what the resistance will be like,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
how to better build the stages

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
of changes inside the company.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
And here, of course,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
organizational change skills are included,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
where we will need those roles

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
that we also talked about above.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
These are the roles

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
of decision-making,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
information roles,

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
we must know everything,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
because who owns the information,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
owns the world.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
These are also interpersonal roles,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
because when organizing

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
organizational changes in the company,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
we need to communicate a lot

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
with our employees.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
How will they evaluate our work?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
What competencies,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
in our opinion,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
are the main and important

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
in the work of a manager?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
One of the competencies

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
is business vision.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
What is evaluated here?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Or how is the manager evaluated

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
according to the competencies

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
that are called business vision?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Here the understanding of the business

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
as a whole is evaluated,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
and the individual processes in particular.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
That is, how much does the manager

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
understand how the whole company works

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and what is the role of his department

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
in this process?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
How much does he know how to highlight

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
the main and secondary things

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
and give his best resources

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
and best time

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
to the main things.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Think globally, but act locally.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And now

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
there is even

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
such a term,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
that is, act locally.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
We think globally

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
within the entire company,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and we act locally here and now.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
The managers of this category,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
who have business vision

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
developed at a high level,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
think at the level of the company,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
analyze the situation

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
in the market,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
propose proposals

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
that correct some strategic

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
or tactical goals of the company,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
which increase

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
the competitive advantages of the company,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
which take into account

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
the strategic vision

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
of our company as a whole,

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
which correctly set priorities

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
and accents within their work.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
This is the competence.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
The next competence

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I would like to talk about

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
is resource optimization.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
What is evaluated here?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
The ability to

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
rationally use various resources is evaluated here,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
which we also briefly talked about.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
That is, financial,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
human, technical and temporary.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
How to evaluate this competence?

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
How to find out

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
that the manager owns it,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
that he has it,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
that he is competent in this matter?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
The proposed initiatives lead

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
to increase in profit or

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
to achieve planned indicators

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
when the budget is saved.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
There are no financial failures,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
there is no budget overspending.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
This can be proposed

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
as a criterion for evaluating this competence.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
The proposed initiatives

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
of the manager allow to achieve

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
planned results with a smaller number of employees.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
We are already talking

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
about human resources.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
The department employs employees of the required qualification.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
There is no inflating of the staff,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
there are no extra people who do not know

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
what to do at work.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Employees work to achieve

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
the result in accordance

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
with their qualification.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
If we talk about

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
optimization of technical resources,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
what is evaluated here?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
The proposed initiatives

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
allow to achieve

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
planned results with

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
a smaller number of equipment

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
or

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
to use the equipment

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
that we have.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
The service life of the equipment is optimal,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
it does not fail

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
earlier due to improper

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
operation.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
The time resources

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
are also

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
similar

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
or correspond

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
to the above.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
The proposed initiatives of the manager

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
allow to achieve planned results

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
with the same costs but for a shorter time.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
The manager

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
can allocate

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
his time resource

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and does not waste time

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
on unnecessary work.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
The next competence

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
that we have talked about in detail

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
is delegation.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
What is evaluated here?

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
The evaluation of the task set,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
how well

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
the employees perform their work.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
That is why

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
managers can be judged.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
If your employees do not perform

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
tasks or fail the plan,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
first of all,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
ask yourself

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
whether I set the task correctly

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
and whether I allocate

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
the necessary time resources.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I tell them

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
where to take it and what to take.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
If the employees do not do something,

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
it is only the manager's fault.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
What else is evaluated here?

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
The delegation itself.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
The manager does all the work

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
himself or his employees

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
do some tasks.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
The organization of the work process

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
in the organization.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
How much

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
people

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
work autonomously

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
in the manager's case.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
How much they work without the intervention

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
of their supervisor.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
All processes are so well-organized

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
that the supervisor's

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
intervention is minimal.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
He does more important tasks.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
He deals with strategic plans.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
What else did we talk about?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
The decision-making.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
What is evaluated here?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
How to evaluate this competence?

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
The ability to make responsible decisions

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
is evaluated,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
taking into account various initiatives.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
The manager makes decisions

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
not only intuitively,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
but also considers

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
alternative options.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
He shows it.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
The decisions are always

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
different in depth and accuracy.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
The search for additional information

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
is always carried out.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
The results of the decisions

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
bring a positive effect

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
not only at the level of the department,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
but also at the level of the whole company.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
The organization of the team work.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
This is also one of the very important

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
competencies of the manager.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
What is evaluated here?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
The ability to create and support

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
team work in the department.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
The atmosphere of team work.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
So that every employee

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
does not feel that he works

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
separately for himself.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
We work together for a common goal.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
The supervisor is

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
a fan of team work.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
He not only

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
demonstrates the highest level

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
of organization of work in his department,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
but also considers the whole company

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
as a team of like-minded people,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
helping other managers

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
to establish team work

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
in their departments.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
The work is organized very effectively.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Everyone works in harmony.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
There are no conflicts.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Or these conflicts

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
have a constructive nature.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
There are no negative outbursts.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Naturally, all employees

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
help each other,

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
give advice,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
and motivate each other

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
to achieve common goals.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
The next competency

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
that directly flows out

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
of the function of the manager

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
is motivation.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
What managers do not like

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
to do for some reason?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Because there is simply no time.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
This is listening,

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
involving employees in decision-making,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
informing,

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
feedback,

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
encouraging, punishment.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
That is, how much the manager

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
can implement the motivating guidance.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
The situation in the department

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
contributes to the fact

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
that employees come out

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
with proposals to improve their activities.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
The manager pays attention

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
not only to the production,

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
but also to the personal situation of employees.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
But here you do not need

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
to be very involved in this,

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
otherwise you can become

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
a vest in which employees

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
will come and cry all the time.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Everything should be in moderation.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
When assessing this competency,

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
the manager

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
always tries to organize

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
joint decision-making procedures.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
That is, meetings take place

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
not only operational,

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
but also with a brainstorming.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
We solve something,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
solve problems,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
empower employees to the level of their own

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
replacement for the tasks set.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Always carry out

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
an operational, deep,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
detailed feedback on the results of the activity.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
The next competence of the manager

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
is leadership.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
This is one of the most

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
difficult competencies,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
because leadership

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
is very easy to understand,

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
to see.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
It is a charismatic leader,

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
as they usually say.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
A charismatic leader who wants to follow.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
But it is very difficult

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
to give leadership

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
a definition, to drive it into the framework.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Because sometimes

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
a person is very charming

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
and you want to follow him too.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
But he does not have such a loud voice,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
some bright charisma.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
But you also want to follow him,

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
you listen to him.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I would like to put

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
not a dilemma,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
but a manager as an administrator

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
and a manager as a leader.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
A manager administers,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and a leader is engaged in innovations.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
That is, the leader is always looking ahead.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
A manager

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
supports more,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
and a leader develops.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
That is, the administrator supported the employee somewhere,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and the leader constantly develops.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
He shows

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
positive moments,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
where there is a growth zone

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
of our employee.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
An administrator or a manager

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
is more of a builder,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
and a leader is an architect.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
A builder is the one who performs,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
and an architect is the one who invents

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
what needs to be built.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
A manager accepts reality

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
as it is, because he has

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
a clearly set task in the Smart format,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
and he cannot go somewhere to the left or to the right.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
A leader

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
changes reality more.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
He looks at how to make it better,

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
and he changes the whole process

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
to achieve the goal

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
more effectively.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
A manager or an administrator

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
relies more on control,

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
and a leader trusts the employees.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
They do it on their own.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
A manager has a short-term view,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
and a leader sees

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
the future.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
A manager asks how and when,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and a leader asks what

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
and why.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
A manager gives time to the details,

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
and a leader looks at the horizon.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
To sum up,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
a manager does things right,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
and a leader does

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
the right things.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
If we put a dilemma

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
or a weight cup,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
what is more important

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
to me as a manager

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
to focus more on?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
To achieve high profits?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
What is more important?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
This or high profits?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
What is more important?

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
According to the research,

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
it is very important

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
to do both.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
It is not a choice between

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
both.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
You have to do both

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
in equal proportions.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
You have to devote

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
as much time as possible

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
to high profits.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
It is about

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
caring for clients

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
who bring money

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
to our company.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
It is about caring for employees.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
The more satisfied

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
our employees are,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
the more satisfied our clients are.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Accordingly, we will get profits.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It is about focusing on tasks,

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
goals,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
papers, standards,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
and focusing on people.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Because people are behind

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
these tasks.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
People are doing these tasks.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
It is about business development,

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
investing money in innovation,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
in business, in development.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
It is about

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
investing financial resources

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
in people's development.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
It is important to do both.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
It is very difficult to choose.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
We cannot choose if we want to be effective

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and if we want our company

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
to develop and work further.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
It is about toughness.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Sometimes you need to demand

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
toughness, clarity,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and reason from your employees.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
It is about delicacy.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
When a person

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
has not fulfilled his task,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
we have already discussed it,

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
when we give feedback.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It is about demanding,

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
supporting,

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
money,

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
and entertainment.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
It is about hard work and hard play.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
How to make it so

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
that you will not work

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
for a day.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
It is about

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
how to turn hard work

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
into hard play

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
so that everyone

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
enjoys it.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
It is about

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
financial reward

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
that is expressed

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
in all material stimuli.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
It is about moral reward

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
that our employees need.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
It is about a manager

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
and a person.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
It is about treating people

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
as employees

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
according to their functions,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
duties, rules,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
and treating them

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
as individuals.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It is about making decisions

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
with your head

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
and heart.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
It is about informing

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
and listening.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
It should not be a one-way conversation.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
You should not say

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
what you are informing

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
and doing.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
You should listen

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
what people say

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
when they work.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
We can learn a lot

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
from our employees.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
They know how

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
to make the work

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
faster,

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
more efficient,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
and more efficient.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
It is about taking care

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
of the company.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
It is about building the future.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
There will be no future

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
without a future.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
It is about autonomy.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Each person is a team.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
It is about passion

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
and suffering.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
It is about good ideas

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
and good values.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Everything is important

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
in a company.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I want to wish you

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
to approach your work

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
not only from a functional

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
and rational point of view,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
but also from an emotional point of view.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Emotional competence

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
is one of the most important

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
competencies

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
that are important

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
for the work of a manager.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Go for it!
