00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Of course, these tasks are not fixed by a formal sign,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
like, I took a piece of paper and put it on the other end of the table.

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
They are still comparable in their significance, in some weight, of course.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
So, the next technique is called the result-oriented planning.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Pay attention to the following slide.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
We are very often used to fixing our tasks in the following formulations.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
Call Ivanov. Petrov. Project. Meeting at 16.00.

00:48.000 --> 01:04.000
However, we can hardly understand the purpose of this event and what result we should get from these formulations.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
So, we suggest the result-oriented planning of your tasks.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Instead of calling Ivanov, you should finish Ivanov's order.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Instead of Petrov. Project, you should get Petrov's information.

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
Instead of meeting at 16.00, you can use another formulation.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Not to make a joint, but to encourage, reward, praise, and so on.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Please pay attention to the following item.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
This is prioritization.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Why is this the Schwab method?

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
We are talking about the head of the company named Charles Schwab,

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
who asked the consultant for help in optimizing his working day.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
He does not have time to perform the most important tasks for him.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
The consultant gave a very banal recommendation.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
Make a list of your priority tasks.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
First, make a list of the most important tasks.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
And then make a list of the least important tasks.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
And, please, perform these tasks in this sequence.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Then, the tasks that you simply do not have enough time for,

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
will remain unimportant.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
The most interesting is the result.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
A couple of weeks later, the consultant received a check for $ 25,000

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
with a remark that it was the most valuable management advice he had ever heard and received.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Indeed, we remember the old metaphor.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
The metaphor about a vessel half filled with water.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
This is a resource of our working time.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
And here are stones, pebbles, and sand.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Stones are large, powerful, important tasks.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Pebbles are medium tasks.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
And finally, sand is not an important task.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
But there are many of them.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
And we really want to put as many pebbles as possible in the morning.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Decide to throw yourself off, to drop as many tasks as possible.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
And we do that by first filling our vessel with sand.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And the water rises significantly.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Our working time is gone.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
After that, we start throwing pebbles there.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
The water rose even more.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
And when it came to starting to immerse stones there,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
the water began to overflow across the edge.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
We stayed there at the end of our working time at our workplaces.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And we put stones there.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And now it's 7, 8, 9 o'clock.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And there are no stones at the end of the edge.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And it's already night outside.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
So, what are the recommendations in this regard?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
As for prioritizing tasks,

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
put the most important thing first.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
You put two stones, and the water rose very much.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
You spent a lot of your working time.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
After that, pour pebbles there.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
The water will rise completely.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
And finally, pour sand until the water has reached the edge.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
And when the water has reached the edge,

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
that is, your working time has exhausted itself,

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
make a decision whether this sand is worth it

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
to stay for it at your workplace,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
when it's already evening and when we're waiting at home.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
So, it should be noted

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
the differentiability of such concepts

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
as the result of orientation and concretization.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Attention to the next slide.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Please look at this graph.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
At the bottom, in the left corner, you have a meeting.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
It's a neutral recording.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
It's not result-oriented and not concretized.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
You start moving horizontally

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
and intensify the concretization.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
You have the following recording.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
A meeting on project A, which will take place at 4 p.m.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
in a kind of negotiating room with such people.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Yes, the recording has become more concrete,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
but it still has no result.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
What do you want to get as a result of the meeting?

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And so we start moving vertically up.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
We begin to increase the result-orientedness of the phrase.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
Here you see a rough, let's say,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
a formulating of project A.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
In fact, you need to give a kick.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
In the upper right corner,

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
you have a high result-orientedness

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
and a high degree of concretization of the task.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
When you determine, first of all,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
the result you need to get,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
the goal of the meeting,

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
and finally the meeting, where it is, when and with whom it should take place.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
And now let's look at our workbook.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
Please open the workbook on page 8.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Here are various formulations,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
both result-oriented and not result-oriented.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Our task is to find the formulations

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
that are not result-oriented

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
and re-formulate them into a result-oriented type.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Let's go straight in order.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
So, hand over the coat to the chemical cleaner.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Undoubtedly, the result-oriented formulation.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
Because if we leave such a note on the table,

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
that is, we ask our family members about it,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
in the evening we can easily check it.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Did you hand it over?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Handed over. Everything is fine.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
So, the next point is to call Petrov.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Please note,

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
by logic, this is a result-oriented formulation,

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
because it contains the necessary verb,

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
which indicates the result that should be achieved

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
and allows us to control later,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
in fact, whether we called or not.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
However, we note that in this case

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
the very concretization of the formulation is necessary,

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
because the very purpose of the call may not be the fact itself.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Most likely, we expect something from this call,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
and what we expect from it,

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
we would like to see in the formulation of the task itself.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
To achieve the signing of the contract with the OTC,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
of course, the result-oriented formulation,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
to transfer 15,000 to the account of the supplier,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
and also the result-oriented formulation,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
to meet with Konstantin.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
Of course, in these formulations a lot depends on the context.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
If Konstantin is our friend,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
and the task itself is to meet with him,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
to talk to him,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
to drink beer, and so on,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
then, of course, we can consider this formulation

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
quite result-oriented.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
If we are talking about a work task,

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
and some certain business hopes are laid out for this meeting,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
then we would like to formulate them

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
directly in this formulation.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Further.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Meeting 15,000 employees.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Not a result-oriented formulation,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
because we need to note

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
what we expect from this meeting,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
and how we can understand

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
whether this meeting was successful.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Please note that many of our meetings

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
are not 100% effective, unfortunately.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
For this reason.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Because when organizing a meeting,

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
we do not clearly represent the results

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
that should be obtained.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Next.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Meeting at 13.00 is a result-oriented task.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Just like making a schedule for tomorrow

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
and going to the cinema in the evening.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Next.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Calling the client T to find out what the problem is.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Quite a result-oriented formulation.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
We can check,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
you called, you called, you found out,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
found out, and great.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Next.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Object R.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
What to do with it?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And here you need to understand,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
what to do with it?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Decide what to do with it, right?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
To agree on what to do with it,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
discuss what to do with it,

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
so that this formulation is not a result-oriented.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
To sleep.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
As a rule, in training,

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
this extremely simple point causes a lot of discussion.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
People say,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
no, it's not at all,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
I need to write exactly how much to lie down,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
how much to get up.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
In fact, what's the harm in hiding?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
This is a result-oriented formulation,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
and we can still find out for ourselves,

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
whether we have achieved the result or not.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Staying with children.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Result-oriented formulation.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Meeting Ivanov.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Contract.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Not a result-oriented formulation,

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
because we need to understand what we expect from Ivanov in connection with this contract.

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
We need to discuss it, sign, cancel, correct, and so on.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
16.00.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Board of Directors Meeting.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Exactly the same.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Not a result-oriented formulation,

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
because we still need to understand what we want.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
We need to organize this meeting,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
we need to prepare the transfer material,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
we need to prepare some kind of send-off,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
we need to speak at the Board of Directors Meeting, and so on.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Withdraw money from AR-Media.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Quite a result-oriented formulation.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Letaev-Pronin calls.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Not a result-oriented formulation,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
because we need to decide

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
what we want to get from Letaev and Pronin as a result of these calls.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
For example, calls to discuss the contract with Letaev

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
and sign this contract with Pronin.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Remind yourself of the Board of Directors Meeting.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Quite a result-oriented formulation.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Again, we have a dubious wording,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
but unfortunately it is very often used in our diaries.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Cancel the event in Vyaz.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
So, ignore this event,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
do not go to it,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
come up with a reason.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Quite a result-oriented formulation.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
And finally, the exhibition.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Project B and Project C.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Not a result-oriented formulation,

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
but a formulation that we should note.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
What do we want?

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
For example, to prepare for the exhibition with Project B and C.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
Prepare the standees for Project B

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
and the distribution materials for Project C.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And so on.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
We should note that with a result-oriented formulation

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
everything is not as transparent as with a concretization.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
And we are always very drawn to concretize some tasks

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
much more than to orient the results of these tasks.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
But in fact, in order to get results

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
on these tasks,

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
we should focus not so much on the concretization,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
but on the result-orientedness of these formulations.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
And the specifics depend on each of us.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
So, we move on to planning our day.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And first of all,

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
we need to select the types of our daily tasks

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
that we need to plan.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Please, pay attention to the next slide.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
So, the types of our daily tasks.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
The first is the tough tasks that we are used to.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
These are tasks that are tied to our exact time.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
A meeting at 12 a.m. is a tough task.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
A presentation at 4 p.m. is a tough task.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
What to do with this tough task?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Of course, as we are used to,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
we need to fix this task in our diary

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
with a binding to the exact time.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
A meeting at 12 p.m.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
A presentation at 4 p.m.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
But we also have flexible tasks.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
What are they?

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
These are tasks that we must do today.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
In this regard, they are not different from the tough ones.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
They are different in that their execution

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
is not tied to a specific time.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
For example, making several calls,

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
preparing some references,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
writing a report.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
In this regard, we should not overload our grid.

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
We should simply make a list of these tasks,

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
arranging them by priorities.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
That is, we will have flexible tasks

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
starting with more priority ones

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
and ending with less priority tasks.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Among our flexible tasks,

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
there are special flexible tasks.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
These are tasks that will take us a lot of time.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
For example, making a report.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
We know that we will do this

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
for at least two hours.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It does not matter to us

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
when we will do this task,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
today at 12 p.m. or today at 3 p.m.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
It is important to us that we should allocate

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
at least two hours for this task.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Why do we talk about allocating time?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
In order to free this time

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
from other tasks.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
So that at this time we are not distracted

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
and we are not distracted and not distracted by anything else.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
This is a very important point.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
We remind you of our locomotive,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
which should move without stopping

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
from point A to point B

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
in order to overcome this distance

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
in a minimum time.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
This type of tasks is called budgeted.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
That is, to perform these tasks

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
a certain budget of time is required,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
a certain time resource.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
And these tasks,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
because they require a certain resource of time,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
it is desirable to place them in the clock grid.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Not, so to speak, fixing their beginning,

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
not necessarily hard determining

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
that, let's say, we will start writing this report at 12.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
No.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
But having allocated the necessary and sufficient

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
time resource on the clock grid

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
and freeing their own time

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
from other affairs at this time.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
So, now we will deal with

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
a very important case for planning the day.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Please pay attention to the following slide.

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
Here is a task for this case.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
So, the first thing you need to do

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
is to analyze the thoughts of the manager

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
who starts his typical working day.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
These thoughts are presented in your workbook.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
After that, you need to make a plan

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
for this working day

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
using the rigid-flexible planning algorithm.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
So, in your workbook,

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
on the one hand,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
this is the description of the day,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
the manager's thoughts.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
If you scroll through this workbook,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
you will see this page in the workbook,

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
you will see your daily page there.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Please see, this page is presented

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
also on your next slide.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
This page is divided into two conditional parts.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
The left part is those rigid and budgeted tasks

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
that you have to do during the day.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
The right part is those flexible tasks

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
that are built in a prioritized way

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
and the execution of which is not tied to exact time.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
So, your task now is

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
to read the whole case very carefully.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
The second thing is to highlight in this case

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
all the tasks that the manager has to solve today.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
The third thing is to classify these tasks

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
into rigid, flexible and budgeted.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
After that, you can proceed to making a plan for the day.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
To do this, in the left part of your daily page

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
you first of all mark the manager's rigid tasks.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
After that, you present in the right part of the daily page

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
all his flexible tasks,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
having built them in a priority way.

22:15.000 --> 22:22.000
After you have highlighted all the flexible tasks of the manager,

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
please determine which of these flexible tasks

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
should be budgeted,

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
which, by definition, requires a budget of time, its resource.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Having highlighted the budgeted tasks,

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
please mark in the left part of your daily page

22:48.000 --> 22:55.000
the time interval during which you will be dealing

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
with the solution of these budgeted tasks.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Before proceeding to the task,

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
please read the planning technique of the working day,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
which is presented in your notebook

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
over these pages of the daily.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
And now, please pause and proceed to solving the case.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
We are waiting for you.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
So, the task is completed.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Let's see what we have.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
Please tell me how many rigid tasks you have found in the case.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
The correct answer is two tasks.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
What are these tasks?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
The first one is to call the boss to the table,

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
and the second one is a presentation.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
Please note that in the process of work,

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
we have new rigid tasks.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
As we set the meeting time,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
the meeting time with the supplier,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
and some other negotiations,

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
but initially we have only two rigid tasks.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
So, in the left side of the daily,

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
you have tasks such as

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
the presentation time and the call time to the table.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
As for the flexible tasks,

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
we set them as priority and put them in the right side of the daily.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
As for the budgeted tasks,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
we put them in the grid.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Please tell me,

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
who has read the task, as we agreed,

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
which is above our daily pages?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
I hope that everyone has read it,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
because it contains the key information

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
necessary for the task.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
It is written there that

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
the gaps between the tasks should be left,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
the air should be left in the plan,

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
that is, the free and unoccupied places,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
and in fact, the total percentage of the time taken

25:31.000 --> 25:38.000
should be 70, or better 60% of the working time.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
You will say, how is it possible?

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
60% is almost half of the working day.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Should we not use it?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
I will answer the following question.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Please tell me,

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
how long have you been thinking about some strategic things,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
your personal development,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
your projects, your company?

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
How long have you been reading the latest news

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
in the legal sphere,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
concerning your activity?

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
How long have you been reading the latest scientific literature,

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
concerning your technologies,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
your activities, your business in general?

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
As for economic literature,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
you will always have this time, believe me,

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
but you will never be in a tight spot.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Why do we recommend flexible tasks

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
to be placed separately, not to include them in the grid?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
This is the main question,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
because in fact, it is more convenient for many of us

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
to plan all types of tasks in the grid.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
But look what is happening.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
We are having a tough time,

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
because we depend on other people.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Someone got stuck in traffic and was late for 20 minutes.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
We allocated an hour for the conversation,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
and he was late for 20 minutes.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
And we got the following task.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
It also went down.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
We start to get nervous.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
We drive ourselves into a state of stress.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
This is never useful for the cause,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
especially for us.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
If we leave a gap between the cases,

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
if we leave large time blocks unoccupied,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
it means that no matter how tough the tasks are,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
we will always have time to solve them.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
We will have time to solve them,

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
as well as to solve some important tasks.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Let's sum up the day's planning.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Pay attention to the following slide.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
So, we don't dive into the working day.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
We don't rush to complete tasks

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
that we have already planned.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
We clearly allocate 5-10 minutes for planning.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
We write down a list of our flexible tasks.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
We check again if there are any new tough meetings.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
How can we do this?

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Our diaries are not made to allocate a separate place

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
for tough meetings.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
We have to make sure that we have a list of tasks

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
that we can allocate a separate place for.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
It's very simple.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
We can divide a standard diary in half,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
if it's big enough.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Or if the diary is not big enough,

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
we write down tough meetings in it

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
and allocate a place for some budgetary tasks.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
We can also write down a list of tasks

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
on a piece of paper or a big diary page.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
I prefer the second option.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
I prefer to keep a list of flexible tasks

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
in my diary.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
I prefer to write down the tasks that we have already completed.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Some people like to write down the tasks

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
on a separate piece of paper.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
They want to tear the paper

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
and throw it away.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
If you feel comfortable with this,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
you can do it this way.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
So,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
the second point.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
We measure the toughness of the planning tool

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
with the nature of the task.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Is it a flexible or budgetary task?

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
We try not to tie flexible tasks to the schedule.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Why?

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
For a flexible response to new circumstances.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
And finally, the third important conclusion.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
The more air in the plan,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
the more reserves,

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
the higher the probability of implementing the plan,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
the higher the simplicity of changing the plan

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
during the day.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
And finally,

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
our conclusion on the whole block of planning.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
The next slide.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Planning is not something tough.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Planning is about how to complete a task

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
in the best time for it.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Next, we manage our tasks consciously.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Everyone should know

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
that we always use a convenient moment

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
to solve our tasks.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
And finally,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
planning should be oriented to the result.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
And for this we use result-oriented formulations.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
And now we finish the discussion on the topic of planning

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
and move on to a very important block,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
the block of self-motivation

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
or self-struggle.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
So,

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
how often do you rest during the working day?

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Not at all?

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Do you rest for 5 minutes?

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
During lunch?

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
I think I hear all these replicas.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Maybe many others.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
In fact, there are a lot of possibilities

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
and a lot of scenarios

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
of a 5-minute effective rest

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
during our working day.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
And you must rest,

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
because typical mistakes of work load

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
are reduced to the following.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
First,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
rest is spontaneous.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
It is not planned and organized consciously.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Second,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
rest is not rhythmical.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
We do not have clear rules

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
about the frequency and time of rest.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
And finally,

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
we do not have well-thought-out scenarios of rest.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Why do we have a problem every 45 minutes?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Because children are not able to immerse themselves

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
in a problem for more than 45 minutes.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
Why do we have a problem

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
in educational institutions?

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Why do we have a problem

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
in a couple of academic hours?

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Why?

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Because we are not able to do it.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
In fact, it is even worse.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Every 20 minutes we need to change our activities.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
This is a perfect state.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
But in fact,

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
the essential need

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
is a 5-minute rest once an hour.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
It is not necessary

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
that we should interrupt

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
the execution of our budgetary tasks

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
and stop resting.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
No, it is not like that.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
We are distracting ourselves.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
And this is wrong.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Of course, when we are immersed,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
when we are focused on the development

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
of a business plan,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
or we are engaged in some kind of report,

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
or we are writing an article.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
Of course, we should not be distracted.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
But in routine,

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
in a flow,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
it is desirable to pull yourself out

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
of this routine state and switch.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
This is also our investment

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
in our health,

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
in our resourceful state during the day,

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
in our adequate perception of problems

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
and in a normal friendly attitude

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
to all people around us.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
So, what are the principles of effective rest?

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
Attention to the next slide.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
The first is that the rest should be rhythmic,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
5 minutes per hour.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
The second is that there should be maximum switching.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
And the third is the maximum change of the context.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky said this best.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Comrade, remember the rules of the simple.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
You work while sitting,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
rest while standing.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
And we really pay attention

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
to the fact that the ideal rest

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
is a rest that switches us

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
from one activity to another as much as possible.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
If we were sitting at the computer,

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
got up, stretched,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
did some microscopic gymnastics,

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
very tiny,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
drank a cup of freshly brewed tea,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
pulled ourselves out of the workplace,

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
walked, brewed this tea,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
came to the window,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
looked what was heard on the street,

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
that is, pulled yourself out of the context.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
If, on the contrary,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
you were traveling all day,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
you were running all day,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
you were discussing something with someone all day,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
then, on the contrary, sit down,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
close your eyes,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
as our colleagues from Japan did on the slide,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
and take a little nap.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
This is a really important point.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
As you know, in Japan,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
new chairs have been developed

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
that allow you to take a horizontal position

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
and sleep a little during the working day.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
It is thought that, unfortunately,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
this has not yet reached Russia,

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
but nevertheless,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
it is possible to sit a little,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
with your eyes closed,

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
and, as psychologists say,

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
to focus,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
that is, not to think about anything,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
this is a very useful thing.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
So, the first thing we agreed on

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
is that we rest during the working day.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
And now let's talk,

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
if we do not rest,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
what should we do with the tasks

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
that we have to do

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
and that we really do not want to solve sometimes.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
And the first task is called

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
an elephant.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
So, the first task is called an elephant.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
What is it?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
The task is huge,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
very, very voluminous,

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
it is not quite clear

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
how to get to it, how to solve it.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
This is a task that should never be solved

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
in one sitting.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
What should we do with this task?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
And what is this task?

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Writing a dissertation,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
developing a powerful business plan,

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
developing a strategy,

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
a development strategy,

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
a PR strategy,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
everything that requires immersion.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
In addition, of course,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
these are our everyday tasks,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
this is a renovation, a move,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
this is some kind of real estate purchase,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
this is even a car purchase.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Everyone knows the elephant,

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
learning a foreign language.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
This is getting a driver's license.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Why?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Because in order to cope

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
with this elephant,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
we need to do a lot of things.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
In particular, we need to prepare a theory,

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
hand it over, we need to hand over the site,

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
we need to hand over the city.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
So, are there any technologies

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
that can solve these elephant tasks?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Yes, of course, there are.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Please pay attention to the next slide.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
We are sorry for the elephant,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
but the most correct thing we can do

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
is to cut it into beefsteaks.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
What is a beefsteak?

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
This is a portion of work

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
that can be done in one sitting.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
This is a portion of work

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
that can be budgeted,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
placed in the plan of the day

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
and calmly deal with the solution of this task.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
But there is a correct approach

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
to cutting the elephant into beefsteaks,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
and there is not quite the correct approach.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
What is it?

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Please look at the slide,

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
and read the page of the traffic rules.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
This is not quite the correct approach

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
to cutting the elephant

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
under the name of driver's rights.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Why?

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
It is a much more reasonable approach

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
to work out one exam card.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Because reading the page of the traffic rules

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
is often not very informative for us.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
We did not get close to the knowledge

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
of the specific situations

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
that occur on the road,

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
nor to the issue of driving license.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
However, when we work out an exam card,

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
perhaps in this case we need to read

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
not one page of the traffic rules,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
but several different pages at once.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
And besides that,

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
we should call our good friend,

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
consult with him,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
consult with someone,

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
think of something else,

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
maybe read something additional.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
In any case,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
this sharply brings us closer to the end result.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Area number two.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
To study the new traffic rules.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
The new traffic rules

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
also apply to the elephant.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
If we are talking about a piece of the elephant

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
called the grammar,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
then I agree with this.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
But if we are talking about a huge elephant,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
about studying the language,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
about using it,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
about forming weekend competitions,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
then, of course,

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
it is more reasonable

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
to do something more practical.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
For example,

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
to talk to a native speaker for a while,

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
to read the head of Harry Potter

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
in the language with your child,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
or to watch Pirates of the Caribbean

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
in the language,

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
or to watch a news program,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
or to read a newspaper in the language.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
In any case,

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
this is what arms you

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
with weekend competitions

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
on the application of those knowledge

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
of a foreign language.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
And finally, the third elephant,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
which is presented on the slide,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
is the article about fitness.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
You know, this elephant

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
is called a change

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
to the best physical shape of the body.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
What very often attracts temptation

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
to study all the new literature

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
on this topic,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
it is better to do exercise

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
or do 50 push-ups

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
or just take a contrast shower.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
That is, finally,

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
move away from words and get down to business

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
and do something useful.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
And now we will cut the elephant.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
And for this,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
again, let's turn to our workbook.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
So, please open the workbook

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
on page 12

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
and turn it over

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
so that you have such a clean page on the left.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Now we are working with a clean page.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Please think about

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
what your elephant

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
in your work,

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
what task you have not started for a long time,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
because it is so voluminous

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
that you really want to postpone it

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
and do as much as possible.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
Second, please decide

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
with the elephant in your private life.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Maybe you have a long time to do the renovation

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
in the apartment, and you are pulling it all the time.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Maybe something else,

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
maybe you have not been tidying up your home for a long time,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
despite the fact that your family is asking you

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
about it very much.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
They are asking you to do something,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
and they demand from you some endless efforts

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
and it is not clear where they should start and where they should end.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
And please decide with the elephant

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
in the field of your self-development.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Maybe you have a long time to write a dissertation,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
maybe you have a long time to write a monograph,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
or something else,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
some other book

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
that will allow you to go to a completely new

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
stage of your development.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
So, you have decided on this,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
and now, please,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
cut the elephant into pieces.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
Before you allocate a small portion of work,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
it is worth determining

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
from which key pieces

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
this elephant consists.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
For example,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
we return to our elephant

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
on the transfer of driver's license.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
As we have already said,

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
this is a theory of the site and the city.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
Here are three blocks that can be further

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
calmly broken into pieces.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
So, in any case,

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
it is necessary to first determine

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
such large blocks

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
from which this case consists.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
And after that,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
this specific block is divided into bifstex,

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
that is, we allocate a small portion of work,

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
which can be done

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
during your working day.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
How to allocate time for this?

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
We have already decided on this.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
This is a budgetary task,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
or, as an exception,

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
you can put it as a tough task for yourself,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
to finally put yourself

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
in a hopeless situation,

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
that you must

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
cope with this bifstex

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
and, of course,

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
start his slow eating.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
You will not have time to look around,

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
as after a while you will find

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
that there is not a piece of your elephant left.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
And we move on to our next dish.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
Our next dish is called a frog.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
What is it?

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
A small,

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
not difficult,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
but very unpleasant thing,

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
which we try to put off

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
as far as possible.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
Ideally, not to do it at all.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
What is it?

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
A call to an unpleasant person,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
a charge that we do not want to do,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
some unpleasant conversation

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
that we have to have,

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
a trip to a dentist.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
It is not difficult,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
it will take no more than an hour,

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
and in fact, in modern conditions,

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
it is not so painful,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
but it is painful and unpleasant.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
So, what to do with frogs?

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
It is very simple,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
this frog must be eaten

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
from the earliest morning,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
as soon as you come to work.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Eating a frog in the morning

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
increases your further performance

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
in three, say the specialists.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
Why? First of all,

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
because you are a winner,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
you have defeated yourself.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
In addition, the most unpleasant thing

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
that was waiting for you today is already behind,

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
and you have already solved

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
all the problems.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
Sometimes life goes so that

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
two frogs are waiting for us,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
one of which is already a toad,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
that is, a big unpleasant task,

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
and the second is smaller.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
We do exactly the same,

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
we start our day

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
with a small frog,

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
and after that we are completely free.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
Someone says,

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
how can I eat a frog in the morning,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
my mood will be spoiled for the whole day.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
You will not spoil your mood

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
for a very simple reason,

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
you already treat it

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
as some unpleasant task

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
and you will say,

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I will deal with it,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I will swallow it now,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
and everything will be fine.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
That is, you dissociate yourself from the problem,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
and this is very important.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Look, you are standing on the top of the mountain,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
right in front of you is a descent on skis,

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
and you have to fall into

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
what is now just a gap,

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
imagine your state,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
and now imagine yourself

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
in a completely different state,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
level, you are standing on skis,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
noticeably stable,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
you are standing well, everything is sunny,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
and there is a small figure of a skier

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
somewhere near the mountain

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
and now he will descend beautifully

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
from this mountain down,

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
and you look at it,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
you have a different state,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
this is the same association and dissociation,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
that is, you are associated with the problem

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
or you are dissociated,

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
and this technique of eating a frog

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
allows you to dissociate from the problem

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
and consider it in the game

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
as a toy,

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
and now I will cope with you,

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
because I am smart,

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
I am brave, I am just fine fellow.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
Next, our frog can have a single character,

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
and can have a regular character.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
For example, we can

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
need to make an unpleasant call,

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
this is a single frog,

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
and if we started learning a foreign language

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
and even split our elephant

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
into beefsteaks,

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
and after that split the beefsteaks

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
into small frogs,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
and these frogs are presented

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
just on your next slide.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
So, three new English words

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
you have to learn every day.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
This is a regular frog,

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
and for its eating you need a special technique,

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
this is a two-dimensional graph

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
that we use,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
which is presented on the slide.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
Please look at the lines,

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
and we mark the days

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
when we have to do this task.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
So, frogs, three new English words,

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
some kind of gymnastics,

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
or cold spitting,

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
or some kind of very contrasting shower.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Please look at the lines,

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
we only mark the days

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
when we have to eat this frog.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
This does not mean that if we do not eat it,

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
we need to immediately become

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
an anti-officer widow.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
There is no such tragedy.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
In time management there should not be violence,

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
this is a vicious circle.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
This is a time-hunting trip,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
a time-hunting organization,

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
or if someone is closer to this association,

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
a suit that is perfectly suited

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
for itself,

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
a suit for organizing your own time,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
for organizing your own life.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
So, if you did not cope with some kind of frog today,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
well, God forbid,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
you just did not tick the box.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
The next day you will definitely tick it.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
This two-dimensional schedule is needed

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
for you to control yourself

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
and not to miss,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
not to forget about your frog,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
which is so asked

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
that you eat it.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
And now please open your workbooks

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
and look at page 12.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Look, please, at the top you have a table

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
in which you must present

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
your unpleasant tasks

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
and in the right column

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
indicate the time for these tasks.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
As you will see,

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
time is actually required very little.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
And objectively,

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
it is not too difficult.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
And how to cope with your own mood,

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
we have already talked about it.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
And after you fill in the top table,

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
you need to fill in the middle table

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
where your everyday frogs and beefsteaks are presented.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
So, in the very left column,

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
please write

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
those very things

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
that are your regular frogs or beefsteaks.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
And note in these columns

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
the process,

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
not the process itself,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
but the fact of eating these animals,

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
namely the solution of these tasks.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
We have one more dish,

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
but before we start eating,

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
I would like to remind you

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
that we are working with our workbook.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Please look at the bottom,

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
our intermediate joys are presented.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
Indeed, our life would turn into God knows what

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
if it reduced to eating

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
all the unpleasant things

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
that we have already talked about.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Beefsteaks,

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
frogs,

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
and other unpleasant tasks.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
In fact,

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
in order to motivate yourself

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
to work with unpleasant tasks,

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
you should choose

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
the most delicious product

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
for which we will cope

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
with unpleasant tasks.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
Namely, choose the most delicious product

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
for which we will cope with unpleasant tasks.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
Namely, choose the so-called intermediate joy.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
It can be anything.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
It can be a trip to the cinema,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
it can be a purchase of a new DVD,

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
it can be a huge delicious cake,

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
it can be two hours of time spent

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
with good friends

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
with whom you have not seen for a long time,

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
it can be a beautiful expensive lipstick

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
or something like that.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Everything you consider necessary and important.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
As one listener said,

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
I will eat frogs for 6 days,

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
I will eat frogs for 6 days,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
and on the 7th day I will eat frog legs.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
Isn't it beautiful?

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
So we move on to our next dish

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
which is called Swiss cheese.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
What is it?

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
When you can't cope with beefsteaks,

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
when you can't solve any task

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
even at the level of your daily working time

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
even at the level of your daily working time

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
even at the level of your daily working time

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
for two hours,

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
we apply the Swiss cheese method.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
The point is to bite off a small piece.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
The point is to bite off a small piece.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
You need to clean your apartment.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
Go and wet the rag and that's it.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
I'll just wet the rag and put it back

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
and I won't do anything with it.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
I need to learn a foreign language.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
I'll just open the textbook,

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
nothing else.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
A small portion of work.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
The point is to make the road easier for the walker.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
The eyes are afraid, the hands are doing.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
So do at least a little.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
You need to write an article.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Write half a page.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
You won't have time to look around yourself

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
how to write the second, and the third one,

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
and the case is over.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
One of the greats gave an example.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
One of the greats gave an example.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
A letter was written.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
What is it that my father doesn't write today?

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
Take a clean sheet of paper and write

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
what my father doesn't write today.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
What my father doesn't write today.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
What my father doesn't write today.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
So you look and write.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
And then a whole new story was created.

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
This is about the Switzerland cheese method.

59:07.000 --> 59:13.000
So we move on to the technique

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
which leads us to a certain completion of the cycle.

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
The cycle of work on time management.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
The technique is called the Pinarik calendar.

59:29.000 --> 59:34.000
It is presented on your slide.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
Please pay attention to the structure of the Pinarik calendar.

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
Why is it a Pinarik? Because it is a Pinarik.

59:44.000 --> 59:54.000
It does not allow us to forget that time is a very material thing.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
And as we said, it is our only inexhaustible resource.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Now we will go through the structure,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and then we will fill in the Pinarik calendar,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
which is presented in your workbook.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
At the top are the years, in the middle is the current year.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Only at the bottom is a line that continues the years.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
That's the whole structure. It is very simple.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And now we will start filling in our personal Pinarik calendar.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Please open your workbook on page 13.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
At the bottom you have a Pinarik calendar for...

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Please write your name or name there.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And then please write that this Pinarik calendar is started.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Write today's date.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
The date when you look at this Pinarik calendar for the first time.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And then let's fill it in.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So, in the first two lines we find the year of your birth.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And crosswise crosswise cross this cell.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Crossed.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Now the next cell after it, also crosswise crosswise cross.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
This is the year when you turned one.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And the next we crosswise cross. This is when you were two years old.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And so we cross every year of your life until the current year.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So, the top two lines end in the year 2000.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And we move on to the bottom line.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Cross 2001, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And cross 7 not crosswise, but one line diagonally.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Because the 7th year is just going on.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Next, we move on to the left column, which shows the months of the current year.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Cross January, cross February, cross March, cross April.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And finally, cross May with one line diagonally, because now we have May here.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Crossed.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Now we start looking at the line that goes to the right of May.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
These are the dates of the number May.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So, the first May is already passed, we cross it crosswise.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And the second one has passed, we cross it crosswise.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So we have reached today's date.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Today's date we crossed with one line diagonally.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Our calendar is ready to be introduced.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Tonight you will cross today crosswise.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And tomorrow morning in the next cell you will put one line diagonally.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
That is, you will cross the next cell diagonally.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Tomorrow evening you will cross tomorrow crosswise.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And so on.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
What is the essence of this technique? Why is it needed?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Please look at the next slide.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So, our first task is to materialize time.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:13.000
After all, it is a great temptation to leave this problem and not think that time is extremely material.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Well, think, another year has passed, well, think again, the New Year, well, think again, summer is coming to an end.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Well, think, think, think, think.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And then, it seems, somehow you don't want to think about anything.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:42.000
So, our task is to materialize time, our inexhaustible, priceless time.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And finally, of course, you see how it is indicated on the slide, this is a daily brain composting, reminding yourself that one day has passed in your priceless, unique life.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:17.000
You know, people who constantly run the Penarik calendar claim that in just a week they have a state of fierce discontent.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Any processes, phenomena and people who greedily claim their time, and most importantly, they do it aimlessly and uselessly and without forgiveness.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
That's the point, so to speak.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And look, please, we are closing a certain circle.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
We started our course with a pie of time.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And we are closing the study of our course with our technique, which is called the Penarik calendar.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Both techniques have one goal, to remind yourself that our time is priceless, our time is inexhaustible, and we must have time to live, not just react to external circumstances.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Summary of the block of self-motivation.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Pay attention to the following.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:34.000
1. Systemic rest management. Do not forget about rest during the working day. Remember that this way we invest in ourselves, in our ability to work.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:47.000
2. Regular self-deception using the time manager menu. Eat elephants, frogs with pleasure and appetite, snack on Swiss cheese.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:01.000
3. Materialization of time and desires. We write down what we want and we achieve it and provide it to ourselves.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And we materialize time using the Penarik calendar. I must say that time managers who are particularly attentive to this problem make a table with a countdown in Excel.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:47.000
So, our course has come to an end.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I wish you all the tools of time management that we have discussed will be useful to you and make your life more rich and more effective.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I also want to wish you to have time to live, not just work, to have time to look at the sunrise and sunset and in the eyes of people who love you so much and who need you so much.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I wish you happiness, health and good luck.
