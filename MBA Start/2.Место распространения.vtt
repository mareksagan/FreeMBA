00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
We have discussed the options for the development of a home network, the strategy of production.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
And now, within the framework of technology development, we will consider how to choose our intermediaries,

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
since we have seen that one of the big mistakes is the wrong choice of intermediaries,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
because the product is not competent, not clear, without calculations.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's take a look. The slide shows the factors that affect the choice of intermediaries,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
and we will now consider them.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
The first characteristic of a product that affects the choice of intermediaries is the shelf life of the product.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Why does it affect? In this case, you need to choose intermediaries that have warehouses,

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
that have refrigeration equipment, an automation system, a logistics system,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
so that you can deliver the product on time. This limits your choice of intermediaries.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Not all companies have such resources.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
The next factor is the technological and technical complexity of the product.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
As I said, for technically complex products, you need companies that are specialists in this.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
If your product is not presented by specialists, for example, you go to the medical equipment market

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
and work with a company that has no idea of medical terms, specializations at all.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
It will be very difficult for them to communicate with doctors and explain to them what is the best product.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
The next point is an innovative product. We have already talked about it.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I drew your attention to the fact that it is the most difficult to sell a new product,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
and not every company will do it.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
Therefore, choose a limited number of intermediaries who can present your product competently,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
and most importantly, agree to do it.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
A heavy and oversized product.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
This is where the logistics system comes in.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
This is the first point.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
And the second point is the availability of storage spaces.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Not every company has a resource for storing and transporting complex and oversized products.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
Therefore, one of the limitations will be the weight and dimensions of the product.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
A standardized product.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
It is easiest to sell and choose intermediaries for this.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
These are mostly dealers who sell products to competing companies, including yours.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
The sales system will be the cheapest here.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Because you don't need to look for specialized companies,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
you just need to go through the market and see who does it better.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
A wide range of products.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
A line.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
If you have a certain line developed in a trading brand,

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
and it is wide enough, not every company will agree to take the whole line.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
What do companies usually say?

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
We don't need a large range, because not all products in this line are sold,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
and not all are of interest to the client.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes, it may be so, but there is a certain dependence.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
If you represent not a line, but certain positions,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
one or two buyers have an opinion that there is no choice,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
and they do not make a choice.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Therefore, there must be a certain range of products.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And the price of a single product.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Of course, this is important, because some companies specialize in the sale of exclusive products.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Someone specializes in the sale of low-priced products,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and someone specializes in the sale of medium-priced products.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I want to say that this is a very large specificity.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
A company that is focused on the low-priced goods market

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
cannot supply exclusive products.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
It will not even be taken seriously on the market.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Therefore, the price very well determines the category and qualification of the intermediary

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
that will work with your product.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
The next factor that we will consider is the characteristics of the company itself.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
The company that will work with your product.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
What is the first factor?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
The first is the company's goals.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
What is the goal?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
It can be the development of your range,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
or becoming a logistics operator,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
or working with several brands.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
The task here is to understand whether your goals and the goals of this company coincide or not.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And here, of course, they must be in the same direction,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
otherwise your product will be completely out of place in this company.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
The financial capabilities of the company are a very important factor.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Because if the financial capabilities are limited, what will happen?

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
You will have a permanent debitory debt,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
because the product cannot be paid.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Or there will be a limitation on promotion,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
because there is no money for promotion of the product.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Or there will be a delay in payment of transport services,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and the goods cannot be delivered.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Or there will be an illiterate logistics warehouse,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
and a lot of problems that are behind it.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Therefore, the financial stability of the company is a very important factor,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
and this, fortunately, can be checked.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
The next factor that must be taken into account is the assortment.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
The assortment is based on your product category.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
If the company already has a full assortment,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
then it is not a fact that your product will occupy a key position in this company.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
You should always look at how many manufacturers the intermediary company works with.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
It is believed that there should be no more than 10-15 manufacturers,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
and if there are 40, 50 or 80 of them, then it is not worth working with this company.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Your product will be lost in a huge assortment of this company

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and will never occupy a leading position.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Unless, of course, it is some kind of know-how on the market.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
The next point is the need for control and the possibility of control.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Because not every company provides information about itself.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
But here is the question.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
If it does not provide information about itself, then should you work with it?

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
If the company has something to hide, is it good for you?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
The next factors that we will consider are the characteristics of the market.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
How much does the market affect the choice of intermediaries?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
What are the most important factors here?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
The first is, of course, the size of the market, its capacity.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
How much can you sell where you want to organize your intermediaries?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
This is a very important factor.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
If you find only one or two clients, or three, then it is certainly not a sale.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Is it worth creating a revenue network for such sales?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Therefore, before creating a revenue network,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
you need to assess the capacity of this region, or this industry, or this client group.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
We will see how to do it.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Geographical scatter.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
Of course, it is important how far you will need to deliver goods.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
How often can transport go there?

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
How will you deliver this product?

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
All this is important so that the product is constantly presented in this revenue network.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Otherwise, what is the point of developing it?

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
The volume of purchases on this market.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
If we look at the market capacity, then how much sales are possible, we assess.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
And the volume of purchases, how many people have the opportunity to buy this product,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
how many of them will be able to buy it.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
And the main thing is that this characteristic is assessed in the monetary equivalent, not in the artificial one.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Another point is the nature of demand, seasonality.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
This must be taken into account, because each product in each region can have its own specifics.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Imagine you sell scooters or motorcycles.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And one thing is that you sell them in the north,

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
and you can ride them for two months a year.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
Or this is the Krasnodar Territory, where it is warm, and winter lasts for a maximum of three months.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
And all the other nine months you can easily sell your product.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
That is why you need to take into account the seasonality, how much seasonality affects this market.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Do you need an intermediary here in this case?

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
So, taking into account all these factors, of course, you need to build a revenue network,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
choose your intermediaries.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
In the workbook, you can see the block of the scheme for choosing the distribution channels.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
There you can recheck yourself, if you already have a revenue network,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
whether you have organized it correctly,

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
or if you have a new product, then you can determine which system is best for selling your product.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Now we will consider the method of assessing clients.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
The method of assessing clients is related to the point that we talked about.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
It is very important to determine your intermediaries at the very first stage and assess them constantly.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
In the workbook, you have an example.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
This is a method of assessment, in which an assessment is carried out according to each criterion,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
a balance, and a weight coefficient is set.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
How does the method work?

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
The first thing we do is clarify the criteria, because for each market the criteria can be specific.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
In the workbook, you will see the basic things that are there,

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
but then you must adapt it to your company, to your market,

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
because you may have specific criteria for assessment.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Then an expert group is formed.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
The expert group consists of the following specialists.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
The first is the sales managers, the middle managers, the sales managers,

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
supervisors, the commercial director, that is, those who are directly connected with the clients.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
The second group of experts is the marketers.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
They must be involved in order to assess the clients.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Why? Because if all this is given to the merchants, what will they get?

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
After all, they all have some kind of personal relationship with these companies.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
And the assessment, if it is carried out only on the one hand, will be somewhat subjective.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
That is why it is desirable that the marketers are present during the assessment in the same way.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
An expert group of 7-9 people is formed and points are given according to each criterion.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
The points are given from 1 to 10.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
One is the minimum point, 10 is the maximum.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
The points are given by each expert individually.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Then the expert group determines the weight coefficients.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
What is it?

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
It determines the weight of each criterion, which, in the general opinion, in the opinion of the majority,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
is the most important when assessing.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
That is, regardless of the companies, but the general ones.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
For example, for each situation, the development of the market will be important for its own criteria.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And every time the weight coefficient will change.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
That is why the expert group determines the weight coefficient.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
In total, this can be done by 1.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And, accordingly, the weight coefficients will be broken.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
What is done next?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Next, the points of each expert are taken and averaged.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Then you multiply the points by the weight according to each criterion.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
And then you add up and calculate the average arithmetic.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
The average arithmetic gives you the key to this client, to the assessment of this client.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
The key says the following.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
We have an assessment divided into 4 groups.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
If your client is in the first group, then you just need to refuse the service of this intermediary.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
If in the second group, then, in general, this is a standard client,

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
but things are not going very well, so you need to check the weak points of this client and try to change them.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
If something changes, great.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
If not, then we also refuse.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
But gradually, not immediately.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
We are looking for a replacement and refuse.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
The third group is a group of optimal intermediaries,

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
who work well, are stable, standard, give you a good enough effect.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
And for them, a standard package of various additional services.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
Service, warranty, technical, maybe some kind of support.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Standard intermediaries, that is, to maintain relations.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
And the fourth group is the best intermediaries, you can say the gold ones,

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
who give you the most turnover, work best with you,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
and additional preferences.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
That is, something better than others, so that they feel this support.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
If they do not feel it, then, accordingly, they can leave.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
If they leave, you will lose a lot.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Therefore, here are constructive relations and constant preferences.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
This is such an assessment, it will help you to optimize the sales system.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
When we conducted such an assessment for the first time, the situation was very ambiguous.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
And our salespeople reacted very badly to the fact that they had to refuse someone.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
They were outraged and said that this was their job,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
that they had been establishing relations for a very long time.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
But after that, of course, we could not insist on this, it was our recommendation.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
But after we made the decision to refuse, everything turned out very well,

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
because additional resources were not spent on ineffective intermediaries.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
And this is calls, business trips, transport logistics, and everything else.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
The work of the department has become more effective.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
Therefore, strive for such a group of intermediaries to be minimal.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Now we will look at two methods that I promised to consider.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
This is the first method, the search for new clients by industry.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
According to the previous method, you have rejected some of the clients,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
now you need something in return.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Let's look for new clients.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
The first method is to search by industry, and the second method is to consider by regions.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
The method of searching for new clients by industry.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
When is it applicable?

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
It is applicable when your product is specific.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
For example, medical equipment.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
You can't sell it to anyone.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
You sell it to intermediaries who work with medical institutions, right?

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Or directly to medical institutions.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
Or, an example I will give is a chromatography.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
A chromatography is a device that decomposes gas and liquid mediums into components,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
into chemical elements.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Where is it used?

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
It is used in medical expertise, in sanitary and epidemiological supervision,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
in alcohol companies, in the oil and gas industry, in the oil and chemical industry.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
That is, there are many applications.

14:30.000 --> 14:38.000
At the time when we used this method, our chromatography was sold in the amount of 50-60 pieces per year.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
And mostly, these were budget organizations.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Here is medical expertise, sanitary and epidemiological supervision.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
We worked with them.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Everything was stable, but very little.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Naturally, the question arose, how can we do this to sell more?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Because the device was in the top part of our positions.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Let's turn to the method.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It is presented on the slide.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
The first thing that is done is the analysis of the product nomenclature.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
By company.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
What is it for?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
To select the key positions, the top positions.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
We must always optimize resources.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Therefore, our task is to choose the main one.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
And first, for the main product, find new clients.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And not to do it for the whole product at once.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
For the sake of optimization, we choose the top range.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
The next thing we do is to analyze the industry markets.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
That is, which markets we can sell to.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
And which of them are the most profitable or promising from our point of view.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
So, just by chromatography, we realized that there is still the oil and gas industry, the oil and chemical industry.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
For some reason, we have not worked on it yet.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
We decided to go this way.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
The next thing we did, and this is the next step in the method,

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
is to go to the industry leader with a favorable offer.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Why the leader?

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
You know, it is always easier to start your activity with the leader.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
The image of the leader is very strong.

16:00.000 --> 16:08.000
New products are listened to, and any product you want to offer can enter your market faster.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
That is, you will reduce the time.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And time is also money.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
So, what did we do, according to my example, with the chromatography?

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
We just found a person sitting on the information streams.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
We turned to the Gazprom Institute,

16:22.000 --> 16:29.000
where there was a person collecting all the requests from the oil and gas industry.

16:29.000 --> 16:36.000
This person gave us some information that there is such a plant, Nizhnyakamsk Oil and Gas.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
This is almost a city plant, it is a huge plant, there are buses with stops inside.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
That is, it is a very large production, and it is dangerous for human life.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
People work in special clothes, in chemical-proof suits with gas masks, and so on.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
That is, production is really very dangerous there.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
The company's leader decided to automate the process to secure his people.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
That is, in order to prevent people from controlling the process,

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
he decided to put chromatographers there,

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
so that they would take the information and send it to the central control panel,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
where a person would already sit and control the situation.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
But there was one problem.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
There were a lot of chromatographers on the market, like any other production.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
But they could not make a choice. Why?

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
They needed a very simple device that simply measures and distributes gas or liquid into components.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
And all the devices presented on the market had additional functions, additional services.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
But, as we know, there is nothing free,

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
so additional functions and additional services required additional money.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
It's like a mobile phone.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Before, we bought a phone just to make a call,

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
and now we have a video camera, an MP3 player,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I don't know, there will be a TV soon, and so on.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
There are a lot of other functions that have nothing to do with the main thing.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Here, it's exactly the same.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Here, they were looking for a simple device,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
no one agreed to simplify it,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
and they needed such a company.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
The next step we took was to establish personal contacts.

18:23.000 --> 18:30.000
We went to this enterprise and asked them what requirements were necessary for the device

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
that they wanted to put into their automatic process.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
We were sent the requirements, we consulted with our technologists, designers,

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
and they said, yes, we can simplify the device without any problems, it's not difficult to do,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
yes, it will cost a little less, but it will not be a disadvantage for our company,

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
because the number that this company requested was huge, it was 600 devices.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
At the same time, as I said, we sold 50-60 a year.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
That is, it was an order for many years.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Naturally, our designers, technologists, our specialists did everything possible,

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
presented the device, and then the next step was the presentation to the industry.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
That is, we came to the enterprise, agreed on a meeting,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
presented our product, which we can put,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
after which the contract for delivery was concluded,

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
and the company received a stable order for many years.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Here, in principle, is such an example.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
If we did not receive such an order, we would go further,

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
that is, the full coverage of the industry, one company, then another, then a third,

19:32.000 --> 19:41.000
until we find the number of clients that we need to ensure our sales plan, we go further.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
Accordingly, when you have processed one industry, the next industry is processed,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
the next one is attractive.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
The next attractive one was the industry for the production of alcoholic beverages,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
and we started working with it further.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Here is such a technique.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
In principle, this is a sequence of logical steps that are necessary

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
in order to find a new client in the industry.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
What is the advantage of this technique?

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
You can take it and schedule it in the form of a plan.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
That is, you take it step by step, schedule it, set the deadlines,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
and you get a plan for finding new clients in the industry.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
This is already a document that can be signed and on which you need to work.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
That's how.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Well, this was the method of finding new clients in industries.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Now let's see how it can be done in regions,

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
because products that have a specificity, of course, we are looking for clients in industries,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
this is certainly.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Now we will consider the method of development of a home network in regions.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
When is such a home network necessary?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
When your product is standardized,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
when it can be sold to non-specialized companies,

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
then, of course, the territorial development path is the most optimal.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
The technique includes 11 points that must be completed in a sequence.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
We will consider them now, you can see them on the slide.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
The first thing we do when we need to develop a regional home network

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
is, of course, advertising in regional media and analysis of the reaction to advertising.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Why do we need to do this first?

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
When we advertise, we do not advertise our product,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
but the opportunity for intermediaries to earn.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
That is, we give an ad in the following text.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
We offer wholesale deliveries of a certain product to a certain region.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Accordingly, this advertising will not cost you much.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
There is one pattern.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Such advertising must be given at least three times,

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
because the regional press, of course, does not repeat itself.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And if your ad is only once,

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
there is no chance that all the intermediaries you need will see it, read it and respond.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
Naturally, in order to wait for a response, additional time is necessary.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
That is why this step is at the very beginning of the work.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
The second step we take is to study the competitors' home networks.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Why do we need to do this?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Let's look.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
Market commercial practice tells us that dealers usually sell goods to several companies at once.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
That is why we can optimize our spending on creating a home network,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
see how intermediaries work.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
This is often very transparent.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
You can ask your clients about it on the websites.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
And, accordingly, see who to offer your product to.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Why not use the network that our competitors use?

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
The next step we take is to analyze the offers in the regional press.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
We literally buy these newspapers, magazines, which print the ad and look.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Who works in this market?

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Who represents this product in the market?

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
And, accordingly, we bring all this information to the database.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
And the fourth point, which may not always work,

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
because circumstances are necessary here,

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
is the work at regional exhibitions and fairs.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Why is this very important?

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
Regional exhibitions and fairs give an opportunity to see who represents this product in this region.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And, moreover, who is the leader.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Because small companies are unlikely to participate in exhibitions.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
These are too expensive events.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
And those who are strong leaders will definitely be presented at this exhibition.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This is the first plus.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
And the second.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
Both companies that present this product in the market and you are in a neutral territory.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
It is easiest to agree, it is easiest to collect information,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
to introduce yourself to some clients, to conduct commercial intelligence,

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
and see who works best and who you like more, who you like less.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
The database is completely collected from these four sources.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
And the next point is just the creation of a database.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Why is it at this stage?

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
We will collect complete information about this region.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Who offers this product?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
To then have the opportunity to choose.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
And, moreover, if we choose and suddenly we do not have a deal,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
we will be able to contact the database again,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
without collecting additional information, without spending additional resources,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
and again find and choose the intermediaries we need.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
Therefore, the fifth step is to create, to form a database of intermediaries.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
What do we do next?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
We have a database.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
And the next step is to start getting additional information,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
which we need for subsequent assessment.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
We collect additional information, bring it to the database.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Then the next step is to select intermediaries by method of assessment.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
We have already considered the method.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
It will only be necessary to work on your product,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
on the specifics of your company, of your product.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Thus, from a large mass of intermediaries,

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
you choose those that are most relevant and acceptable to you.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
And in parallel with this step, we develop a typical contract and a discount matrix.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
For what?

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
In order for the intermediaries we select to make the appropriate offer.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
After all, we cannot make our offer without a contract and a discount, right?

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Therefore, two points, the selection of intermediaries and the development of a discount matrix,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
and a typical contract are carried out in parallel.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
The next step we take is to conclude short-term contracts for the supply of our products.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Why short-term?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
We need to check how this intermediary works,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
whether it can handle your product,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
whether it can present it on the market,

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
how effective its household structure is for working with this product.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
This step is necessary, although many people neglect it, unfortunately.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
They immediately conclude exclusive contracts,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
on volume, dealer contracts, then lose the market.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Therefore, it is necessary to take a test step first.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
When we take a test step, we look at the consequences.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
The next step is trial deliveries and additional selection of intermediaries.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
We choose the best of them.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
We don't need many of them.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
Two or three for the region, and sometimes one.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Therefore, you have the opportunity to choose.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
And then, with those whom you have chosen, there are long-term contacts.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
And here, it may be necessary to rework the discount matrix,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
to refine the terms of the contract,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
taking into account the client's specifics,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
his capabilities, his resources and his potential.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
This is a method that also consists of logical steps.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
What is its advantage?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
You take this method,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
you place these steps in a sequence,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
determine the time,

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
and you get a plan for the development of the regional household network.

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
This method gives you the opportunity to develop a household policy in the region very well.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
Well, we have considered two methods for finding new clients.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
But before going to a particular market,

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
it is necessary to accurately assess what target segments are in these markets,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
who our intermediaries will work with,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
who our product is aimed at.

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
Here we will consider one of many methods of segmentation and selection of target segments.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
What is a segment?

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
A segment is a group of buyers or a group of clients

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
who present the same requirements for your product.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Let's take, for example, the computer market.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
The simplest example.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
What groups of consumers exist in this market?

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
There are home users, those who buy a computer for home.

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
For example, for games, for watching movies, for working on the Internet, and so on.

28:06.000 --> 28:15.000
There are computer users who are in research institutes.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
There are users who buy computers for server organization, and so on.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
What is the point?

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
Each group of these consumers has its own individual requirements for the product.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
There are designers who need special requirements, special computers, special power,

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
their own requirements for RAM, and so on.

28:37.000 --> 28:44.000
When we form individual proposals for each group, this is segmentation.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
We target our product directly for this group of consumers.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
This optimizes our resources.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
Because we don't have to work on all target segments.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
There is no resource optimization, no directionality in this case.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
We lose resources and time.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
Let's look at one of the methods, as I said.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
In the slide and in the workbook, this method will be fully presented.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
You can refer to it.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
What is happening here?

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
We take segmentation criteria.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
There are 10 of them.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
Each criteria evaluates possible segments.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
We select all possible segments on which we can offer our product.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Then, each criteria evaluates.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
The evaluation is carried out on a 10-point scale.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
From 1 to 10, 10 is the maximum, 1 is the minimum.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
The weight criterion is also included.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
The weight coefficient is very interesting here.

29:44.000 --> 29:51.000
From 1 to 3, 1 is not a very important parameter, 2 is the middle parameter, and 3 is the high parameter.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
The evaluation is carried out.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
Then we multiply the weight by the weight.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
And we also subtract the middle arithmetic.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
Let's comment on the criteria for evaluation.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
The first is the number of segments.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
The number of segments is recommended to be evaluated in the money equivalent.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
Because the number of clients will be incorrect.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
Therefore, evaluate the possible sales volume in this segment.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
The more, the better.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
The availability of the segment is a very interesting criterion.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
The availability of the segment should be considered not only from the point of view of territorial availability.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
For example, to deliver an opportunity at a certain time.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
For example, in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, we have territories where navigation only happens once every six months.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
And there people also need products, household appliances, and everything.

30:47.000 --> 30:55.000
Therefore, the availability of the segment is considered, first, from the point of view of territorial availability, and second, from the point of view of entry barriers.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
Let's take, for example, the motorcycle market.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Scooters, motorcycles, and so on.

31:03.000 --> 31:14.000
Now there is a program, a government, which implies the equipment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Emergencies and the Russian Army with motorcycles.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Of course, a tender is announced.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
To win this tender, it is necessary to make a huge effort.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
And at the same time, an administrative resource is needed here.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
Because without it, we simply will not be able to participate in the tender and not win it.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
This is also an availability, this is an entry barrier to this market.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
In the same way, you can evaluate the network difference.

31:37.000 --> 31:46.000
To enter a particular network, we need to pay an entry bonus, we need to give an additional discount.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
How acceptable is this for us, the company must decide.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
This is also an entry barrier.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
This is also the availability of the segment.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It is easiest to sell tents in a tray.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
But maybe it's not so interesting in terms of turnover, right?

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
And the most difficult thing is to enter the network, but the turnover there, of course, will be incomparable.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
The next parameter, the next criterion of assessment is the stability of the segment.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
What is it?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
This is related to seasonality.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
Seasonality is when the volume of sales drops, then rises, but it is still there.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
However, the stability of the segment can be estimated like this.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
There is a market for half a year, and half a year it is not there at all.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
That is, there is no sale at all.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
This market is unstable.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
And here, of course, the less stable the market, the worse for the company.

32:35.000 --> 32:43.000
Why? Because it will have to form an additional assortment for production to ensure the stability of production and the stability of sales.

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
Let's take the example of mosquito cream.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
When is it sold?

32:52.000 --> 32:58.000
It starts selling in May, probably ends in September, and the rest of the year it just does not sell.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
This is an unstable market.

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
Accordingly, companies that are engaged in this product have to look for some additional products

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
that will compensate for the shortcomings of production and sales.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
The next criterion is profitability.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Profitability in the segment can be different.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
Let's take and consider examples of profitability in the budget industry.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
For example, we sell medical equipment in a budget clinic and in a commercial one.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
So, where do you think the profitability will be higher?

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
Today, the situation is that the profitability is higher in the budget sector.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
Because the money invested in the budget allows you to spend it without choosing a particular company.

33:43.000 --> 33:50.000
But commercial companies count every penny and look where the offer is most profitable.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
Therefore, paradoxically, the profitability in the commercial segment will be lower.

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
Naturally, the higher the profitability, the higher the point will be according to this criterion.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
The next criterion is the level of competition.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
Naturally, the higher the level of competition, the worse it is for the company,

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
because it will have to spend additional resources to compete with competitors.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
But the evaluation of competition is also ambiguous.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
What do you think is better?

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
When there are many competitors and they are medium or small.

34:22.000 --> 34:29.000
For example, there are 20-30 competitors in this segment, but they are of medium size or small.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Or when there are only 3 competitors, but they are large.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
Of course, it is more difficult to enter the market where there are fewer competitors, but they are large.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
Why? Because they also set entry barriers,

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
they are more likely to fall into a conspiracy and prevent other companies from entering the market.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
For example, I can give a telecommunications market, not the entire market, but the mobile communication market.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
You know, 3 main players are MTS, Vimble.com and Megafon.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.000
And these 3 players actually hardly let other companies enter this market.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Actually, they are the largest, and others cannot get in there well.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
And this situation will continue for some time.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Therefore, the higher the competition, the lower the score.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Here the characteristic will be inverse.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
The next point is protection from competition.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
Protection from competition is the presence of at least one competitive advantage.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
Remember what a competitive advantage is?

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
This is the difference at least some from your competitor.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
If you have it, if you can position yourself in this way,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
consider that there is a direct road to this market.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
If your product is so standardized that there is no difference,

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
come up with it, create an additional service, additional services,

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
something else that will additionally distinguish you from competitors.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I will give an example here.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
The situation in the air conditioner market.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
When we were developing a home air conditioning system,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
we had the same situation.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
It was very difficult for us to enter the market.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The product was practically standardized.

36:11.000 --> 36:18.000
And we thought how to stand out from the general mass of the strongest competitors and foreign manufacturers.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
And what did we come up with?

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
We created an additional service for our intermediaries.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
They really liked it.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
What is this additional service?

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
We asked our intermediaries, what worries you in our product?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Why are you afraid to work with it?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
What did they say?

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
We do not know its quality, we do not know how it fails, and so on.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
We know that the quality of foreign manufacturers is high.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
And we know nothing about your device, about your product.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
And words are just words, because the product is new on the market.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
Thus, we offered them to create an exchange fund.

36:53.000 --> 37:01.000
That is, 10% of the volume of the delivery, we offered additional air conditioners for free,

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
on the terms of responsible storage.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
For what?

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
So that if at least one device fails, they can instantly replace it,

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
without thinking that you need to send it to the manufacturer, then repair it,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
then send it back again.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
This is all time, these are all additional difficulties that the client absolutely does not need,

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
and they should not worry about it at the competent level of the service.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Therefore, our clients really liked it.

37:31.000 --> 37:39.000
Thus, they were insured from such failures that would involve the client's disloyalty.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
This helped us to enter the market very quickly.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
In just 4 months, we have formed a system of distributors in the number of 42 companies

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
that agreed to work under these conditions, and our products entered the market very quickly.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
This was our defense against competition, our competitive advantage.

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
The next point, the next criteria are advertising opportunities of companies in the segment.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
It seems, where and what product cannot be advertised now?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Everything is advertised, there are many channels,

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
you can tell about your product here, but it is a deceptive idea.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
There are products that are difficult to advertise.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I will give an example.

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
A company that produces industrial equipment for the production of food products.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
For example, equipment for the production of drinks, or equipment for the production of milk, and so on.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
This equipment…

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
Actually, the company's director asked me with such a request.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
I cannot advertise my product. Where can I do it?

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
Well, of course, standard industrial equipment is good for advertising in the industry press,

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
in industry magazines, at industry exhibitions, at conferences, the most effective.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
What did she tell me?

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
I did it all, but because of these sources, I did not receive a single order at all.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That is, the money goes in vain.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
Of course, it is also important, but it does not justify the costs of promotion.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
There must be efficiency in any case.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
What did we do? We began to interview customers, buyers of companies.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Where do you get the information when you purchase a particular equipment?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
What for?

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
We received obvious answers, obvious later, when we learned about them.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Of course, at first we just did not guess about it.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
We were told that we consulted with colleagues in the workshop.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
We simply asked colleagues who had already purchased equipment,

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
where they had purchased it, how it was serviced, how it was installed,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
whether all the technologies worked.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
And, in general, the answer was clear.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
You just need to take the recommendations of customers who have already purchased equipment,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
installed it and are being serviced.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
This is what the director of this company did.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
And the costs of promotion were reduced several times and became more effective.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
Because she took the recommendations of companies that had already worked with her,

39:59.000 --> 40:06.000
the recommendations of their clients, and sent them with a commercial offer in a mail mail.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
And then she called and clarified the further conditions.

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
It worked very well, because the recommendations of colleagues mean a lot for specialists.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
So, be careful when approaching advertising channels.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
You do not need to spend a lot of money, you need to spend it effectively.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
The next point is the possibility of service in the segment.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
If you can provide a service, it is very important, it is a big plus for you.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
If you can't do it, competitors will do it.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
Especially foreign companies that are in the service of notary, they do it very well.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
We are still learning, we are still young in this area.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
I hope we will grow up to be adult people.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
So, about the service.

40:52.000 --> 40:57.000
Do you think there is a service for beer, for example?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Yes, there is.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
This is chilled beer, because if you want to take a bottle of beer on a hot day,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
you are unlikely to take warm beer.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
And this is also the manufacturer's concern.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
To make cupboards, refrigerators, so that the client can use his products conveniently.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Well, you can give a lot of examples about the service.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
But I will say the main thing.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
Not a single product is bought without a service now.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Not a single one.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
If the client is dissatisfied, he will not come to you anymore.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Even if you have a super high-quality product, you will not sell it anyway.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
Because there is another similar one, but with a high-quality service.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
So, think about the service.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
Although this is a separate big topic for conversation.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
The next criterion is the dependence on limiting goods and services.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
What is it?

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
These are goods or services without which your product cannot work.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Here is a simple example.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Let's take printers.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
Stream printers that need cartridges.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
If these cartridges are not available, your printers will either sell poorly,

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
or the client, once he finds out that he cannot buy consumables,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
will simply no longer buy your printer.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
This is an additional assortment.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
If you sell the main one, then be kind to think about whether you can provide

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
the availability of these additional goods or limiting your use.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
Another criterion is the technological difficulties of working in the segment.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
What is it?

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
This is a very important parameter, because it helps to understand

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
whether it is easy to work with your product.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Is it necessary to change the whole technology completely?

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Is it necessary to study this additionally and for a long time to apply it in work?

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
Or in your personal use?

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
That is, everything should be simple and clear.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I will give an example.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
Our company sold a device for the production of dead and living water.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
As in the fairy tale, I watered it with dead water, everything came to life.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
I watered it with living water, and everything came to life.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.000
There is such a device that carries out the usual chemical process,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
electrochemical process, which allows you to get dead and living water.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Where is it used in our life?

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Dead water is used for disinfection, as a disinfectant,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
in pharmaceutical companies, medical institutions,

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
in cosmetics companies, in the agricultural industry.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
There is a lot of application of this product.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
And most importantly, this device is very quickly purified,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
does not require additional resources.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
Live water is used in all these industries, but for a different purpose.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
On the contrary, for the purpose of growth of something.

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
We used dead water for the stations, medical institutions,

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
pharmaceutical companies.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
How did it happen?

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Before, in hospitals and stations,

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
chlorine was diluted in water, everything was washed, everything was clean.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Accordingly, chlorine smelled.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Chlorine is a very dangerous ingredient for a person.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
It accumulates in the respiratory tract, then accumulates in the body,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
and is taken out for a very long time.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
There used to be such a statistic, when our water was chlorinated,

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
they said that a person with water eats 3 kilograms of chlorine per year.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
Now, different companies are cleaning water in different ways,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
but chlorine is gradually being removed.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
So, of course, it was necessary to move away from chlorine

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
in the stations and medical institutions.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
People there are already sick, so why do they need additional difficulties in the body?

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
We developed the following device, which allowed to get this dead water,

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
wash everything in the same way, but there was no smell, no harmful impurities,

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
the device was quickly bathed, everything was great.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
We developed such a device, offered it to the stationers in the clinic,

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
installed it, and a month and a half later,

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
we came to see what happened, how our device works,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
what we saw.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
We go in quietly, an elderly woman who works as a nurse

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
comes to her box, pours chlorine there,

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
collects water and calmly washes the floor.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
We think, well, probably the device is broken,

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
but for some reason they didn't tell us anything.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
We come to her and ask,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
tell me, why don't you use it? Is it broken?

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
She says, what are you, God forbid, is it broken?

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
We say, why don't you use it?

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
Something is not right, some difficulties.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
She explains to us.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
When we installed this device, the nurse told me,

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
this is now your responsibility.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
If it breaks, I will deduct from your salary.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
She says, my salary is so small that I will live without it for two years,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
just work on this device.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Therefore, of course, I am afraid to approach him.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
We say, why are you afraid that it will break?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
He is very reliable.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
What did she tell you?

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
You know, your device has two buttons, one to turn on, the other to turn off.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
I forget everything, and therefore I will not approach him at all.

46:09.000 --> 46:16.000
So, in fact, such a situation was in about 60-70% of medical institutions.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
The specifics of the industry,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
elderly people mostly work in these positions.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And what did we do?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
We reworked the device.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
We put one button,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
which you could just press once, it was turned on,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
and the second time you press it, it is turned off.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
We reworked it, we could not even imagine that such a difficulty could occur.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Therefore, when you offer a device in one or another segment,

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
try to think about how and who will use it.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
This is very useful.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
So, we have considered all the criteria.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
What do we do next?

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
Next, we evaluate and choose a segment with the highest scores.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
That is, those points that turned out to be the highest of all,

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
we take as target segments,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
taking into account the weights, of course.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
Therefore, here we immediately focus our work on those target segments,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
which are the most interesting.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
In the example, which is presented in the workbook,

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
we consider the market of office furniture and book of trading equipment.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
The company produced office furniture in the middle and low price segment.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
The competition was very big,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
again, the companies were leading the market.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
The entry barriers were very large.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
Nevertheless, the company worked, but the turnover stagnated,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
that is, did not grow.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
And the company wanted to develop.

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
When we conducted research, we found out that the book market is gaining momentum.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
And, of course, they need special equipment.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
What equipment do they need?

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
In self-service stores, when you enter, you see bookshelves.

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
And, accordingly, they are on the level of about a meter, and up to the floor.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
So, they have several types of books.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
The shelves were designed in such a way

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
that each shelf had its own angle of inclination,

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
so that you could see everything from above and below,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
you could see the whole shelf.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
This is a special design,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
that is, these are not just straight shelves, and so on.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
This design was patented,

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
and, accordingly, it was offered to book networks.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
When the assessment was conducted,

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
we were just considering which segment would be most interesting for sale.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
We were considering the following segments.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Those that are presented in your workbook on the slide.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
This is office furniture.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
Small enterprises, medium enterprises, budget organizations.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
And book sales equipment.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
These are book networks, these are separate stores,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
these are archives and libraries.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
Of course, the archives and libraries are budget organizations.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
Nevertheless, it was very interesting to offer them this product.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
What did we do next?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
When we chose the target segments,

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
then we looked at the consumer characteristics of each segment, their importance.

49:07.000 --> 49:13.000
That is, we looked at what we need to base our commercial offer on

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
when we offer a product to our client.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
The slide shows two options.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
On office furniture, one segment is medium enterprises,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
and on book sales equipment, these are book networks.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
If you look, you will see a very big difference.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
In the first place, in both segments, of course, there was a price offer, a discount price,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
since they are the most important for each segment.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
In the second place, opinions have already been divided.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
For office furniture, it was the terms of execution,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
and for book sales equipment, it was the design.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
That is, it was necessary to have a very good look,

49:51.000 --> 49:56.000
so that the network was in a single design, in a single designer style.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
And, of course, this feature took second place.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
In the third place, in office furniture, there was the quality of production.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
And book sales equipment has a service package.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
What did the service package include?

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
It is the installation of equipment under the key.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
The shop owner gives the territory completely,

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
and the company first designs the equipment,

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
then manufactures, then installs, and then serves.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
This was the only interesting thing about the network supermarket.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
Why? Because book stores open further and further,

50:31.000 --> 50:38.000
and this company can further install this equipment in a single style.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
The service package took the third place.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
And so on.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
You will see the difference between these consumer characteristics.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
I want to focus your attention on the fact that on the basis of these characteristics

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
commercial offers are formed,

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
that is, the most important ones are taken, and emphasis is placed on them.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
In your workbook, the options for commercial offers

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
based on the segmentation for office furniture,

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
everything is divided there.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
There are commercial offers for the office furniture,

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
there are options for commercial offers for all segments,

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
and also the characteristics that are important for each segment are divided.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
Medium enterprises, small enterprises, private individuals and budget organizations.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
When you look at the example, you will see how convenient it is.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
Such a table is a checkmark for commercial units.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
Yes, they are competent, smart, successful and can well present their product.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
But such a table will not hurt them anyway.

51:40.000 --> 51:47.000
Because in the form of advantages that can be discussed in negotiations,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
they are more successful in holding them.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
This helps them a lot.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
Negotiations are in progress, something is forgotten,

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
you can look and make another offer and give another advantage,

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
which a person will not forget, having such a checkmark at hand.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Therefore, we highly recommend it.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
When we form a commercial offer,

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
we need not only the advantages of the product, but also the amount of discount, right?

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
Because our intermediaries rarely work without a discount.

52:17.000 --> 52:24.000
I want to give you an example, a table developed by the academician Igor Lipsets,

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
who presented this table in his book.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
It is very convenient to work with it, it helps to determine what discount you can give

52:35.000 --> 52:41.000
and how much you need to increase the volume of sales so that the amount of profit does not decrease,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
but remains at the same level.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
You can find this table in your workbook,

52:48.000 --> 52:54.000
and it will help you a lot in determining discounts and forming a commercial offer.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
Well, this is how we formed a commercial offer,

52:58.000 --> 53:04.000
made it for our clients and started working.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
But in order to understand how effectively we work,

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
of course, you need to regularly evaluate the client's profitability.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
In your workbook, you have a table with expenses,

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
which must be taken into account when evaluating the client's profitability,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
and a method of how to do this is described.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
And now we will consider the situation in standard companies,

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
which usually happens, and see why it is necessary to evaluate this profitability.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
In front of you, on the slide, there is a graph,

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
which shows the volume of sales of certain categories of clients.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
Standardly, we have always been like this.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
According to the Pareto rule, we evaluated the volume of sales.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
The rule of Pareto is 80% of the sales volume is made by 20% of your clients.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
So, we always thought so.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
But in fact, we were holding on to our golden 20%,

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
because they made the main turnover, and of course we depend on them.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
So, what I would like to say.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
Now we have conducted an analysis of 500 companies and deduced the following dependence.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
Not only the rule of Pareto is involved in the assessment of profitability.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
Let's consider the method of assessing the client's profitability.

54:28.000 --> 54:34.000
When we collect and analyze all our clients, we get the following picture.

54:34.000 --> 54:40.000
10% of the largest clients make 125% loss.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Why does this happen?

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
Because large clients take large shares and demand large discounts,

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
because we depend on them, and in fact we do not earn on them.

54:50.000 --> 54:57.000
And also, taking into account the costs of delivery, service, advertising support,

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
when we calculate all this, we get a loss.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
This does not mean that we should give up on these clients.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
We should also make a turnover at the expense of some large clients.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
Naturally, we will not give up, but it is necessary to know how to manage.

55:13.000 --> 55:18.000
Therefore, calculate what your largest clients give you.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
Then 20% of clients, which are average,

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
they are not the largest, but not the smallest.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
It is the average that is the most profitable for us.

55:28.000 --> 55:36.000
They give 225% of the profit, which, of course, compensates for the costs of our large clients,

55:36.000 --> 55:44.000
but nevertheless allows us to understand who needs to be concentrated more and with whom,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
how to work.

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
And the other 70% of clients work at the level of profitability.

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
They do not give you a special profit, maybe a small one, and do not cause you to lose money.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
This is such an interesting statistic, collected by scientists,

56:02.000 --> 56:09.000
who have analyzed more than 500 enterprises operating on the market, successful enterprises.

56:09.000 --> 56:16.000
Therefore, I recommend you to calculate, as I said, the calculation method presented in the workbook.

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
The most important thing, of course, is the need and availability of a management account,

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
so that you can divide your costs for each client, divide.

56:25.000 --> 56:30.000
So, we will continue to consider the technology of creating a home network

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
and see how to choose regions for expansion,

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
in order to determine where we are interested in working, and where not so much.

56:39.000 --> 56:48.000
Segmentation is one type of choice, and, accordingly, the choice of determining the attractiveness and potential of the region

56:48.000 --> 56:56.000
is another method that allows you to understand not only how huge the market potential is,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
but also how well it develops.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
From two points of view, the assessment system will be matrix.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
The slide shows an example of the assessment of the attractiveness of the region on the example of the elite alcohol market.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
Why am I focusing on this? Because for each market, the criteria will be different.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
The main principle is the following.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.000
The first is the potential of the region, this is the volume of this market at the moment,

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
how big it is, how it suits you.

57:26.000 --> 57:32.000
And the second part of the assessment is attractiveness, how much it is actively developing,

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
because this is the future, this is the development of your company.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
We choose criteria for the assessment of the region.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
Let's look at the example of the elite alcohol market.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
What criteria did we take to determine the potential?

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
The first is the volume of the elite alcohol market.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
The second is the development of the level of retail networks in the region.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Why is this important to us?

57:56.000 --> 58:02.000
The more retail networks, the more volume we can pump into this region.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
The next is the dynamics of consumption of elite alcohol,

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
that is, how the market grows, how often people buy elite products.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
And the next point is the level of the payment capacity of the population.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Why is this important?

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
The market may be potentially large, but if people do not have the funds to buy products,

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
the market may not be very interesting for us.

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
The next criteria is attractiveness, that is, how well the market will develop.

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
The first point is the number of people who are older than 18 years.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
Why? Because alcohol can be consumed only after the age of 18.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
Therefore, for us, of course, this parameter is very interesting.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
The next point is foreign investment in the region.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Why is this important to us?

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
A very interesting point for the elite alcohol market.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
It has a direct relationship to development.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
As soon as we see an increase in investment,

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
we see that a very good situation is developing in the region.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
The better the market develops, the more income the population grows,

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
the more they allow themselves pleasant things.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
The next point is the dynamics of the development of the region itself,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
the dynamics of the development of its retail product turnover,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
that is, how it grows.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
Look, for comparison, the Moscow market and the Nizhny Novgorod market.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Two cities that are very different in themselves.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
Why? The Moscow market is potentially very large.

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
There are a lot of customers who can buy this product.

59:36.000 --> 59:44.000
But its development dynamics are already very low compared to the dynamics of development in Nizhny Novgorod.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I will give you some figures.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
The turnover of Moscow grows by 5-6% per year,

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
and the turnover of Nizhny Novgorod grows by 30-35% per year.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Look at the difference.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Why is this important to us?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Because it is easier to enter the developing market,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
it is easier to develop there and it is easier to get up.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
There is not such a high level of competition.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
That is why we assess the attractiveness of the region from two points of view.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
The potential can be compared with operational activity,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and the attractiveness with strategic.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
We look at how we can develop in this region.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
The next point is the level of competition.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Of course, we also assess the level of competition.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Expert assessment is carried out here.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Commercial and marketing departments participate in expert assessment.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
These are the departments that are somehow connected with the market.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
The assessment is given from 1 to 9.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Then the weight coefficients are set.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Here, attention, the weight coefficient for the potential of the region should be equal to 1.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And the weight coefficient for the attractiveness of the region should be equal to 1.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Then you multiply the numbers, calculate the average arithmetic and get the result.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
The slide shows the result of the assessment of the regions.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
There are 9 squares in which certain regions got after the assessment.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Naturally, the squares under the number 1, 2, 3, 4 are the most attractive for work.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And you need to start with the first one.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Why? Because there is a good average potential, but the development is much higher.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
The second square, where the potential is high and the level of development is high,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
but the level of competition is quite high, so it is a little more difficult to get there.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Then there is the third square, where the potential is high, but the level of development is average.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And the fourth square, where both assessments were obtained at an average level, from 3 to 6 points.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
That is, you can get there, but this is most likely a perspective, work for the perspective.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
That is, at the moment you will not make big turns there.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
But in the future, this is possible in a very promising market for sales.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Thus, the methodology helps to assess the attractiveness of certain regions,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000
not only from the point of view of the current profit, but also from the point of view of the company's development in the future.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Let's look at the stages of distribution development.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
We have already considered that depending on the life cycle of the product,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
the distribution develops in different ways, it has its stages.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Now we will look at some features that companies need to pay attention to when developing a distribution system.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
The development system has three main stages.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
What are they characterized by?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
The first stage is when the company has just entered the market,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
the company itself, not the product, but the company, and begins to sell.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
How does it behave?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It gains a large range because it has no other competitive advantages,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and begins to recruit sales representatives or sales managers who offer this product on the market.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000
They have a very large price list, as a rule, and they just sell.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Accordingly, the success of the company depends only on the sales managers themselves.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
They sold well, the company feels good.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
They could not work, which means it did not work.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
This is the very first stage of the company's development.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It inevitably has a place to be, and it is simply impossible to immediately jump to the third stage.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Therefore, for some time the company works like this,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
masters the market, understands its specifics.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It is advisable not to stay at this stage for a long time,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
because it is not the most effective, not the most attractive.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.000
The second stage of development begins when the company sets itself a task not only in terms of sales volume,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
but in terms of sales volume, in terms of the top range.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
The company often sharply reduces the range,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
because it understands that the sales manager cannot focus on the entire range of the company.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
This is impossible and ineffective.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Usually, the range is reduced, and moreover, the top range is selected, which is best sold.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Tasks are set for it, and, accordingly, the sales manager already has two tasks in terms of sales volume.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
On the contrary, and in terms of sales volume, the top range.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Yes, this is a good stage, the second stage is the development of the company.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Nevertheless, it has both advantages and disadvantages.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
The first advantage is the speed.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
You can create such a system very quickly.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
The second advantage is flexibility.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It was not possible to work with one distributor, with the second, and the third is the operability.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You can contact a particular company very quickly, solve issues, and so on.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But, in fact, this stage has a lot of disadvantages.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Let's look at them.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
The first disadvantage is high competition among manufacturers.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
What we have already discussed today.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Each dealer or distributor has many manufacturers.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And inside, dealers or distributors compete with each other.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Well, imagine, one company gives funds for promotion, the second, the third, the fifteenth,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
and the dealer no longer knows what to do.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
He looks where it is more profitable, and sells.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And he is not particularly interested.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It is clear that your assortment is top-notch, so your task is to focus on your assortment.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
To stand out among the many manufacturers that supply this product to him.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
The next disadvantage is the dependence on the leaders of the trading representatives.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
What is it?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
In any company there are people who know how to sell well.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
They mostly take a good client base, work at interest rates.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
They are not very interested in the output of a new product, because they earn well on the existing one.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
They have established relations and work very well with them.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
What is the disadvantage for the company?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
They sell well.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
The disadvantage is that you depend on them.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
If only this sales manager decides to leave your company, God forbid, the competitor,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
then you think you have lost this client.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
This is what happened to us when we changed the distribution system.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Some managers who worked in the catering segment,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
it is the most difficult to establish relations there,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and we lost about 30% of the client base.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
It was a very bad result.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
We had to restore everything again.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Therefore, special attention should be paid to this.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
How to avoid the situation?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Give an assistant.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Let the second assistant, a young manager, go and learn together with this leader.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
This way he will gain experience and a base,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
and establish relations with your key clients.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
The drain of regional products is also a big disadvantage.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Why?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
You have made a sales system,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
you have two or three distributors,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
they start to compete with each other.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
They gain a large volume,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
at large discounts,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
then they cannot sell it,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
and they start to sell it at low prices in the regions.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
This is very bad,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000
because they create additional competition for those who work there.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
This, of course, must be avoided.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
How?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Structuring the sales system clearly

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
and trying not to make price changes.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It is difficult to control,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
but if possible, you need to try to do it.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The next disadvantage is the dependence on the human factor.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
This point often intersects with the leaders of the trading representatives.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
You actually depend on them,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
depend on the person.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And you need to create a system that will not depend on the person,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
or will not depend on the maximum,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
as little as possible.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Then your system will work like a clock.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
That is why it goes to the third stage of distribution development.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
What is this third stage?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
When we set ourselves other tasks,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
we set ourselves tasks for the volume of sales,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
for the top range,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
and also a plan for the marginal income.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Why is this important?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Imagine you set a task for your regional managers.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Here is the volume of sales, here is the top range.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You have to sell it.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
He sells.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
He tries to give more discounts to get more volume.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Conduct some additional programs.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Is it profitable for the company?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Most likely not.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Because the marginal income is eaten up by these programs,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
by these budgets, by these discounts.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Why does this happen?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Because your manager is motivated

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
not to earn money,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
not to earn money,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
but only to increase the volume of sales.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
That is why when the company goes to the third stage

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
and thinks about the marginal income,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
the third stage of development begins.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
A more serious, more stable, more competent.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Why is it important to set a task for the volume of sales?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Now we will look at the method of forming the volume of sales

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
or sales forecast.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
This is one of the key issues

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
when forming a household network

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and, accordingly, when optimizing it.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
When we set a task for the volume of sales,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
of course, we want the volume to be greater.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Let's look at the method

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
developed by Jean-Jacques Lambin

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
to optimize the company's turnover.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
How can it be increased?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
At what steps can we increase the volume of sales?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Let's go through the ladder,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
which is presented on the slide.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
The first thing we can do

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
is to strengthen the company's position.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
We think that everything is fine in the company.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
We have a sales department,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
we have a sufficient number of managers,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
they are qualified,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
they work competently,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
their functions are not duplicated.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Believe me, such a perfect situation is very rare.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Nevertheless, optimization in this area

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
allows to increase the company's turnover

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
up to 42%.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
This is only in my practice,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
maybe somewhere there is more.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I will give an example

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
of how the sales organization works

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
among managers in commercial departments.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
One of the companies produced plastic windows.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
The profiles for plastic windows were collected and sold.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
The company was organized by a person

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
who worked before in a research institute.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
He brought a team of his colleagues,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
who successfully found the equipment,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
installed it, launched the technology,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
organized production.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
They were great specialists in this.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But as soon as the question of sales arose,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
the question of the product was raised.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
It was 8 years ago.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
It was the most active development

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
of this market, the plastic window market.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
There were not so many competitors then.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But the manager asked a question,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
why is it not being sold?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
They invited a consultant.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
The consultant looked at the company,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
looked at how people work,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
and said,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
you just don't have competent sales managers.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
He said, how come?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
There are guys, competent, with a scientific degree,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
and so on.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
What about them?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
They can't sell.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
What was the answer?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Of course not.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Sales should be done professionally

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
by completely different people.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
They should be ambitious,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
purposeful.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And a scientific degree is not necessary here.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
The main thing is that he can

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
present the product and sell it competently.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And this is actually a talent needed.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Or at least skills.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Very good skills.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
That's why the product was not sold.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
What did the consultant advise?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
To hire sales managers.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
They found three people,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
three young people,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
developed a good motivation system

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
that really motivated them,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
and launched them into the field.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
What is it called?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
The result was stunning.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
In three months,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
so many orders were collected

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
that the production stopped doing well.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Of course,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
the company bought additional equipment,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and now it is one of the leaders

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
in the North-West region

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
in the production of plastic windows.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Only optimization in the commercial department

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
allowed to achieve such great results.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
That's why you need to approach

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
the sales organization very competently.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
If everything is great there,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
and there is nothing to improve,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
then we move on.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
We attack competitors.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
You can attack competitors in different ways.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You can produce a duplicate product,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
you can lower prices,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
you can fix all kinds of obstacles,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
launch rumors.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
There are many ways to fight competitors.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
There is one but.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
If you are a strong company in the market,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
you can afford this luxury of fighting competitors.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
If your company is not so strong,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
not so large at the moment,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
it is better not to get involved in this fight.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Because competitors will crush you

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
if they are stronger than you.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Therefore,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
be careful with competitors.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
If you are already fighting with competitors,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
or you don't need it,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
we move on to the next step.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
We take the next step.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
It is to stimulate the application.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
That is,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
try to find niches

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
where you can still apply your product.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Or try to make it

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
used more often.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Let's remember a shampoo.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
A regular shampoo that we wash our hair with.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Ten years ago

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
it was said

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
that

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
you need to wash your hair

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
once a week.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Why?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Because there was a shortage of products.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
What is written on the bottle

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
with shampoo today?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
For everyday use.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
This is just to stimulate the application.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Remember the ad.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Chewing gum.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
A girl puts two pillows in her mouth,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
not one.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
This is also to stimulate the application.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And so

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
you need to look for some moments

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
that will make you buy your product more often.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Or change it more often.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
As it happens on the market

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
of the same mobile phones

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
that we talked about today.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
New functions are added

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
and we buy new and new models.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
We are forced to do it.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
You can make a connection

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
with a regular model.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Good.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
If you found such a function

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
or an additional market,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
you have already increased

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
your sales volume.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But there are other options.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
The next step is to expand the sales.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
For example, we worked

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
in five regions

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
or in ten regions.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Now we can expand

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
to additional regions.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Of course, this will cost.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
But it will give an additional turnover.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Because additional region means

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
additional sales.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And one more thing.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
This is to add a range of goods.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
If you introduce a new product in the range,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
it automatically increases

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
the sales volume of your product.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
These are the moments you can take into account

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
when forming a sales forecast

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
and when setting the task

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
to increase the turnover.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Well, I'll tell you

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
how to assess the sales volume,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
calculate it correctly

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
and correctly

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
to do it with minimal error.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
The first thing we will consider

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
is the Ansofa matrix.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
This is a matrix of strategic planning.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Strategic planning will tell you

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
about it in the course.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I would like to focus

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
on the practical application of this matrix

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
for the accuracy of the sales forecast.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
This is what we do

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
in our company today.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
How can it be applied?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I'll briefly remind you

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
what Ansofa matrix is.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Ansofa matrix is divided into fields.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
This is the old market – the old product.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And the new market – the new product.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Accordingly, there is a strategy

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
to work on this product

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
or on this segment

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
to cross these fields.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
The old market – the old product.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
We just penetrate the market deeper,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
increase the turnover

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and increase the sales volume.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
We increase the turnover

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
of existing clients

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
for the existing product.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
If we choose the old market – the new product,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
it means that we offer

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
the existing client a new product.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
This strategy is called product development.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
If we sell the old product

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
on the new market,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
we are looking for new clients

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
for the existing assortment.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
This is called market development.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
If we sell new products on the new market,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
this is a diversification strategy.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
We change everything.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
We change the product, we change the market.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
This is the most risky strategy.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
But sometimes,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
if it works,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
it can be the most profitable.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
How to apply this matrix

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
to sell the product?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
We do it as follows.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
We divide our clients

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
on the new clients

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
with whom we plan to sign the contract

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
and on the existing ones.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Then we choose the key clients

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
according to the rules of Pareto.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
These are the main clients

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
that make the main turnover.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Then we ask our commercial managers

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
to predict the sales

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
of the existing clients.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Then they predict

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
how they will offer

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
our new product

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
to the existing clients

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
and how they will sell it.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Of course,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
we need to have additional negotiations.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
But we don't have many clients.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
We only choose the key ones.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
The next step

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
is to consider

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
whether they can offer

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
our existing products

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
to the new potential clients.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
They also make a sales forecast.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We have statistics

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
for the previous clients.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
We look at how they bought the product,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
what was the increase in turnover.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
We compare

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
similar regions and similar clients.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It helps us to build a figure.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
When we have diversification

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
of new products and new clients,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
it is actually an intuition.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
The manager

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
determines

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
how much he can sell

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
the product to the new clients.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Then we add

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
the figures to this matrix

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
and multiply it

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
by the percentage of the new product

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
that was presented on your slide.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
We multiply the percentage

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
of the new product by 95%.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
There can be 5% error,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
although managers

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
are very good at

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
determining the sales volume

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
for the key clients.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
When we buy a new product

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
from the old clients,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
we take the coefficient 65.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
60 or 70,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
we take the average one, 65.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
We get the same figure.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
We reduce the figure by 3-5%.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
The next step is

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
to buy the old product from the new clients.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
The accuracy of the forecast is reduced

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
because we haven't worked with these clients yet.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Nevertheless,

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
we multiply this figure by 45%.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
We subtract 55%.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
New clients, new products

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
have an accuracy

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
of 10-15%.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
The numbers we get

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
form the total sales volume.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I want to say

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
that this method works very well

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
and helps to reduce

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
the probability of error.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Of course,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
the commercial structures

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
are involved in this forecast.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It helps them to assess

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
the prospects of working

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
with certain clients.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
We have been using this method

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
for 3 years

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
and it helps us

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
to implement the tasks.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Let's move on

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
and consider

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
the following table.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
When we get

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
such a sales forecast,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
it may not coincide

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
with the tasks set by the management.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
The management always wants more.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Now we have to conduct

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
a gap analysis.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
When we have to see

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
how we can increase

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
the sales volume,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
we have recently discussed

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
the method of increasing

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
the sales volume.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
We can increase it

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
by combining

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
two methods

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
of Ansoff

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
and Jean-Jacques Lambin.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
By combining

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
these two methods

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
we can get

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
and understand

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
what we can get

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
from the sales forecast.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
This topic

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
is discussed in detail

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
in the workbook.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Please, pay special attention to it.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
As a result,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
after we conducted

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
the gap analysis

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and understood

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
how we can increase

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
our sales volume,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
we can get

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
such a table.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It is a real example

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
of how we can increase

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
the sales volume

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
by 160 million dollars.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
We understood

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
how much we can

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
achieve

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
and then added

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and understood

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
how we can increase

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
the sales volume

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
by 160 million dollars.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The first thing we noticed

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
was the increase

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
in sales

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
volume.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
We did not set such a goal.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
We clearly defined that

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
we will grow due to the growth of the market.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
The next thing we noticed

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
was the increase in sales volume

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
due to the marketing activity

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
and due to the growth

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
of the distribution level.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
We expand the market

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
and promote our product

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
in this market.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
We get additional sales volume.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
The next thing

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
is the introduction of new positions.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The new assortment of products

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
that we planned to introduce

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
took a certain turn,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
which we calculated and set as a goal.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
The next thing is the exit

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
to the new market

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
of other countries.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
We set such a goal

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and, accordingly,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
we reached the number

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
set by the manager.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
The goals can be achieved

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
not only by the sales volume,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
but also by the financial goals.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Here is an example

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
of the financial goals.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
We divided the assortment

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
into three groups.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
The first group means

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
maximization of profits in segments.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
The main brands of companies,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
well-known trading brands,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
which allow to earn

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
a large margin income,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
are included.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
The second group is the image products.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Without them,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
they are a kind of a locomotive

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
when entering

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
certain trading points or clients.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Although we do not earn

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
much money on them,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
we have allocated them to a separate group.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
The third group is a product

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
that takes its turn.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
It has a huge turn,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
but a small margin income.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
We clearly understood where we earn profit

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
and where we take a turn.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Such a structure is very important

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
in order to develop the budget

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and to understand

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
where to direct

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
communication influence,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
where to promote the product.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
It is quite clear that

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
in the segment

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
with a large turnover

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
we carried out only

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
supportive communication,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and on the other hand,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
we gave the largest

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
advertising influence on brands.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
This justified itself,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
because the profit there is large.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The fourth group is the development

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
of a sales forecast,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
which is applicable not only

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
to existing products,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
but even to the development

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
of a sales forecast of a new product.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I want to say that this method

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
was developed in 2000.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
The method is a compilation

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
of two methods of quality assessment.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
These methods are known,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
but their combination

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
gives the smallest error

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
when calculating the forecast.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I will give an example

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
of split systems

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
with which we started

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
the development of this technique.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
The first thing to do

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
is to analyze the demand

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
and supply on the market.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
This is the work of marketologists

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
who have to show

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
which market is the most promising,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
where to go,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
where the largest sales volume

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
can be,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
what are the trends of development,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and how interesting it is to work there.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
The next step is to select

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
the target segments.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
We have just considered the method

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
of selecting the target segments.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
We select them and make a sales forecast

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
only for the target segments.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
We do not need a sales forecast

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
for the general market,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
because we will promote the product

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
only for the target segments.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Everything else will be additional sales.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
It will be those 20%

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
that do not make up the main turnover of the company.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
The next thing to do

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
is to select the calculation methods.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
We have made a compilation

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
of even three methods,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
but the first method, the normative calculation,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
did not show itself well

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
in this situation.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I will explain why.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Statistical methods work very well

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
in stable markets.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
When it is clear how much and what will be consumed,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
what time and what price,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
then it is easy to calculate.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
You can calculate the consumption of bread,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
milk, because it is a product

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
that will not go somewhere.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
There will be a small error.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
But the products on the market

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
that are highly competitive

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
and, moreover,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
unstable situation,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
constantly changing,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
such a method does not suit.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I will give an example.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Once we came to a conference.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
One professor of the University of St. Petersburg

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
developed a wonderful method

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
of trend assessment of sales forecast.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
He presented it

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and said that the accuracy

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
of his method

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
is only 5% error.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
It was perfect.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
We just introduced a new product

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
to the market, and we were very interested

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
in this method, because we needed

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
to predict the sales as accurately as possible.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
We were ready to buy this method.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
We approached him

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and asked what features

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
are present in the application of this method.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
He told us that everything is fine,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
everything is fine, it will work.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But one condition.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
In order for this method to work,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
you must enter the input data

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
for sales

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
for the previous 50 years

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
per month.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Can you imagine where such data

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
from our market, which has just been formed,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
come from? We do not have so much time.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
He says,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
then the error will be greater.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
For example, 40 to 60.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
We can predict without any method.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Therefore, of course,

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
mathematical models are applicable,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
but it all depends on the input data

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
that you entered.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And you still enter it yourself,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
it turns out to be of high quality.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
That is why only high-quality estimates

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
work on new markets, on unstable ones.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
They give less error,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
more competent people

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
give information about how to assess

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
the sales forecast.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Well, two more methods that we used

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
as a result.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
What is this method?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
We chose three reference groups.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
The first is the company management,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
the second is sales managers,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and the third is our clients,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
who are available.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And, accordingly, we asked them a question.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Please predict the sales volume

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
of split systems

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
for the next year

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
and

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
the total market volume.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Accordingly,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
the management gave us its figure,

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
that is, the vision

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
that the managers had.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
The management

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
sets up this process

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
and they are the main marketologists.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Therefore,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
it is rare to put

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
unreasonable numbers.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
People who manage the process

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
usually know what they are doing.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
The second point is

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
our sales managers.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
They predicted,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
of course, their sales forecast was less,

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
but we got the figure.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
The third group is our clients,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
who also gave us the figure.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So, you know what an interesting situation we got.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
The difference in the forecast was 12.5%.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
The top were managers.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
The lowest forecast

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
was given by sales managers.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And approximately in the middle,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
but not exactly in the middle,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
but 5% of the forecast

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
was given by clients.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And the difference between clients

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
and sales managers

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
was 12.5%.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
We did not stop at the reached number.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
We decided to double-check our figures

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
and used the Delphi method.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
The Delphi method is a very interesting method,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
when experts are invited

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
to assess the sales forecast.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Accordingly, we chose experts

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
who have been working on the market for a long time,

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
who are really the leaders of the industry.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
There were 5 of them.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
We asked them the same question.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Please predict the volume of sales

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
of the industry by split systems

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
and the volume of sales of our company.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
The characteristics of the systems

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
were presented to them.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Each expert predicted the figures

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
separately from each other.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Then they sent it to us.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
We compared all the figures

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and saw that there was a big difference

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
between the predicted figures.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
What did we do next?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
We put all the figures together

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
into a single document

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
and sent it to each expert.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
What was the purpose of this?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I read it and thought

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
that I did not take into account

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
the fact that the second expert

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
was right and I would agree

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
that the figures should be changed

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
in a positive or negative way.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Someone said the opposite.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I do not agree with this.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I am not going to change my figure.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Thus, we need to make

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
so many visits to the experts

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
until the difference

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
between their figures

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
is not visible

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and the difference

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
between their figures

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
is not more than 10%.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Then we can rely on this information.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Thus, we got a very good result

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
in two visits.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
What was surprising

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
was that the figures of the experts

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
matched the market's

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
customer's assessment.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
We took this figure

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
for our sales forecast.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
We got a very good result.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I want to say that

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
when we summed up the results

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
after a year,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
we made a mistake of 5%.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Our managers sold

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
5% more.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
This was a very good result.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
The slides show

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
the data

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
on the optimal pessimistic

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
and optimistic forecast.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
We used all three figures.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
The smallest figure was

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
the pessimistic sales forecast

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
which was known only by the manager.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
He could count on this

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
in the smallest possible way.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
We took the average forecast

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
for the optimal one

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
and put it in the sales forecast.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
The optimistic forecast

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
was a bar

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
for additional bonuses.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
We developed

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
a motivation system

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
to make the managers

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
want to go up

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
to the optimistic forecast.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Thus, they sold

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
more than we planned.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
This gave us a good result.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I recommend you to use

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
the methods we discussed

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
in the workbook.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Everything is described in detail.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
The next part of the course

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
is about the efficiency

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
of the home network.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
It is not enough

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
to build a home network.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
You need to understand

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
how it works,

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
whether it is effective

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
or not.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
You need to understand

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
how it works,

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
whether it is effective

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
or not.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
You need to understand

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
how it works,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
whether it is effective

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
or not.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
It is one of the key factors

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
of your company's success.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
In Russian practice,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
there is a saying

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
that there is no control,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
no work.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Or you can say

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
that the order of management

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
is a reason for reflection.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
If you don't control,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
you will never see results.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Let's look at this topic.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Let's look at this topic.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Let's look at

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
the real mistakes

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
and problems

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
in building relationships

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
with intermediaries.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
What do we not take into account

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
when building relationships?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
The first mistake

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
is that we did not evaluate

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
the market opportunities adequately.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It is a mistake of all marketologists

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and businessmen.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
We did not have time

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
or we decided that we already knew everything.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Why should we spend additional funds

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
and time to calculate?

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
We did not calculate.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Our intermediary cannot simply

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
make the volume that we demand from him.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
He is right about this.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
The market is a market.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
It dictates its own rules.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
The next mistake is that

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
we used the same methods

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
that foreign partners

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
use in their markets.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
We do not take into account

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
the losses and losses for companies.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Because the methods and steps

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
that we use do not give us

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
the result that we want.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
One more thing.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
We did not take into account

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
the legal features of the market.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
There are many of them in every republic

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
in our huge country.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Every republic has its own legislation.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
There are its own agencies

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
that determine the rules of trade

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
with certain goods.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I will give you an example

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
from the alcohol market.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
In Krasnodar Krai

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
our company has branches.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
But we cannot sell

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
a lot of elite alcohol there

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
because the governor of Krasnodar Krai

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
introduced a quota

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
for importation of products.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
He supports his producers.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Probably, from the point of view of the Krai,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
this is right.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Nevertheless, we could sell more.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
But the legislative restrictions

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
do not allow us to do so.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
We do not want to increase the volume of sales.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
We do not plan to do so.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
It will not help us.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
We should also take into account

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
the main problems

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
between the producer and the distributor.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
What is special here?

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
What should we take into account?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
We should consider

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
whether we can sell directly

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
to the region where our distributor works.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
This process must be discussed.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Because if we sell directly

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
to the region,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
we will interfere with the distribution

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
of our products.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
What should he do?

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
He will just sell the products

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
at low prices,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
spoiling the market.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
We will not be able to sell them.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
The next point

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
is to understand

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
whether we have one exclusive distributor

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
or a pool of distributors.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
There are several of them.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
The main thing is

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
to understand the problems.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
As I said, you cannot keep the problems

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
in secret. If you do not solve them,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
they will be solved by themselves

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
and most often not in your favor.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Another point

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
that I would like to point out

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
is that the market of wholesale companies

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
is leaving.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
In the future,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
logistics operators,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
manufacturers and networks

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
will remain.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
This is the future.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
The distributors who work in this market

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
understand this perfectly

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
and begin to choose their future activities.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Some go into logistics,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
and some begin to create their own brands.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
If your distributor creates

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
his own brands and sells your products,

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
it is not a fact that he will pay

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
enough attention to your products

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
in order to actively promote it.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Please take this into account.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I would like to

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
touch a little on the issue

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
of division of functions

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
between enterprises and intermediaries.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
It is necessary to clearly divide

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
the functions.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
In the workbook, you have an example

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
of the division of functions

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
between the enterprise, the manufacturer

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
of cars and the car dealers.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
When there are suppliers of components,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
there is a manufacturer of cars,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
there is a distributor,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
several dealers come from him,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
then there are agents who offer

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
the product and the consumer himself.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
So, between the manufacturer,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
it is necessary to clearly specify the functions.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Who is responsible for what?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
So that there is no duplication,

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
so that there is no overshooting of functions.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
This is very important for a clear work

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
and for a clear interaction.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Who is engaged in the supply of components?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Who is engaged in the registration of documents?

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Who is engaged in transport?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Who is engaged in logistics?

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Who is engaged in warehouses?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Who is engaged in delivery to the end customer?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Who is engaged in self-insurance?

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
When you have built this system clearly,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
everything becomes clear to everyone.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
When it is not there or it is not registered,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
everyone does what he thinks is necessary.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
And so your company has no order,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
no optimization of resources.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Let's touch a little on household logistics,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
because it plays one of the leading roles

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
in the formation of the household network.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Our country is large,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
and logistics one way or another

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
affects the price of our products.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
The further we deliver the goods,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
the more our products cost,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
because these expenses

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
are often in the cost of production.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
In this regard,

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I recommend you pay attention

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
to the optimization of the stock,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
because you do not need

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
to store a lot of products

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
in your company,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
in your warehouses,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
because it distracts resources,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
additional money, time,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
labor, which, again,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
are part of the cost of production.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Or you can store a lot of goods

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
in the warehouse,

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
and this will affect the cost of production.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Or the cost increases,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
which is not very good for the market,

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
or the profit decreases.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Companies lose money again,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
so it is necessary to clearly consider

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
every point where you can

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
optimize your household logistics.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Three main groups are

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
the content of the stock,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
the implementation of the stock,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
and the third is the loss as a result.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Either they did not deliver,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
or they stole, or they lost.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
There are different reasons,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
respectively, it happens.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
You have a complete list of

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
warehouse expenses in your notebook,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
which must be taken into account

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
when doing household activities.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And also a formula is given

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
by which you can calculate

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
the optimal stock supply,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
the norm, and it is constantly

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
adhered to.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
That is, the company should be a person

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
who constantly controls

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
every normative stock.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And the fourth is the lack of production.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Because imagine,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
you spent money on promotion,

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
you brought this product to the market,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
your dealers or distributors

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
actively got to work,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
and suddenly the supply of the product

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
is again out of the shelves.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
These are additional costs again.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
This is all again from the beginning,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
and even more difficult,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
because they have already seen

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
a problem with you at work.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
That is why I recommend you

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
to use a formula that would help

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
to assess the critical stock of your product

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
in your warehouse

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
and optimize your warehouse expenses.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I would like to see

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
how you can assess

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
the effectiveness of the household network.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
We have already discussed

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
that you can create,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
you can work,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
but you must assess.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And not only financially.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
We have already considered the financial formula,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
but not only finances play a role in our lives.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Here you are offered a method

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
of multi-criteria analysis

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
of the household network options.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And on the slide you see

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
the criteria by which the assessment is made.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
The first criteria is the correspondence

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
of channels with the demand of consumers.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
That is,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
how comfortable and convenient it is

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
to buy products in those channels

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
by which you distribute it.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
The next point is the management of channels.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
How competently

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
you can control the operation of these channels.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Control and manage.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Because if there is no control,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
you can't manage at all.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
How accessible it is to you.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
How actively your intermediary

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
provides information to you.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
The next point is the level of competition

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
for the ability to work with this channel.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
How strong are the competitive positions?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
How do they oppose you as a competitor?

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
How much money do you need

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
to invest to form

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
and work there

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
with this household network?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
The next point is the perspective of channels.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Long-term trends.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
How well this channel is developing.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Let's look at the example of retail networks

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
that are now very actively developing.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
And by the development of the Western market

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
we see that they will also develop

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
even more.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And let's look at the attractiveness

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
of small pavilions.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
We know that a law has recently been passed

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
that the number of pavilions

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
will sharply decrease

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
because they interfere with traffic on the streets,

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
it is difficult to control them, and so on.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And we see that the attractiveness of channels

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
is completely different.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Thus, we took four main criteria

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
that help us determine

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
the prospectivity of the household network,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
the attractiveness of working with it.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
We evaluate this on a 10-point scale.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Then we look at the final score,

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
the average arithmetic score.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And here we add the financial assessment

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
according to the formula that was given earlier.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
And we get

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
a matrix assessment.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
This is a matrix

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
that we can use

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
to determine

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
which channel is the most optimal

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
for us.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And of course, this is the first square.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
If your channels are selected,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
these are the most optimal channels for work.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
They suit you

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
both in terms of profitability

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
and attractiveness.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
They are the most interesting.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
In the second place is the standard channel.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Why? Because the level of profitability

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
for the company is a very important criterion.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
The company should also live today.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Not only develop.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
If today there are no funds,

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
tomorrow there will be nothing.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Therefore, the standard channel

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
is number two.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
These two channels are the intermediaries,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
the channels that are key for you.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
And you should work

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
very actively with them.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
But the potential channel

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
is probably aimed at development.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
If you do not spend

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
a lot of resources

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
for its development,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
continue to develop.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Do not leave this channel,

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
because there is probably your future.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
But another channel,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
another square

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
called the dubious channel,

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
of course, you need to get rid

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
of these intermediaries.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
It is better not to leave them in your portfolio.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
But if, of course, they are not

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
politically significant for you,

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
then, probably,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
you will not go anywhere.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
At least you will know that

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
this is not a profitable channel.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
We leave it for a reason.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
For example, for politics.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
We need it.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But if you evaluate from the point of view

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
of economic development,

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
then it is absolutely not interesting for you.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
How else can you control

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
distribution channels?

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Of course, regular checks and accountability.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
It is necessary to develop forms

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
on which intermediaries will constantly report.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
It is necessary to develop forms

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
that will load your intermediaries

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
from morning to evening.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
They must sell, not write reports.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
But you must have

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
key positions and key information.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
What is this key information?

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Sales volume, growth dynamics,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
number of client bases,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
sales of the top assortment.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
They can provide you with all this.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Also, the effectiveness of assessment

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
of the event, which is held,

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
if it is held at your expense.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Price control.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Although this is the most controversial point.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I will say right away that price control

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
is probably our future.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
While we are very difficult to control it,

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
we cannot be present in all regions at once.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And the intermediaries use this.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
They issue prices that are not

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
in our policy at all.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And even sometimes the product is repositioned

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
due to this.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
But, unfortunately, we can't do anything here.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I can only advise more detailed control

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
and price registration in the contract.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Price control on shelves.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
If your product is put on the retail network,

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
then, of course, sometimes

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
you need to do a retail audit

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
with the help of third-party companies,

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
consulting companies,

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
which will conduct a retail audit

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
and show the real situation.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
How well you are represented

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
in a particular network or in a particular region.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Of course, the control of the event.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Because if you spend your money,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
you must understand how effectively

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
these funds are spent.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
How well they are received by the client.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
How well they fulfill their obligations.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
How well they work in this market.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Suddenly you need to change your client.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
As a result, I want to present you

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
several methods that allow

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
to perform this control.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
The first is, of course,

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
the volume of product implementation

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
on this channel.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
You have two tables on the slides

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
that allow you to evaluate

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
and analyze the product.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And the second is

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
that allows you to evaluate and analyze

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
the volume of sales in the regions,

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
in the sales channels,

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
direct channels, distributors,

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
optics, dealers,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
and also in the segments of consumers.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
These three analyses

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
are very important for work,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
because they allow you to understand

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
who is sold and how.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
It is very important to build

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
a strategy for the future,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
a sales strategy for your product.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
The next point to consider

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
is the conditions for the calculation

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
of the sales channel.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I want to say that they should be

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
optimal for you.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
If you are satisfied with the discount

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
of 10%, the payment deadline

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
is 45 days, then you can work

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
as you wish.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
The main condition is that

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
it should not be worse than other

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
manufacturers, for example.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
That is, there should be parity.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
The load of production capacities

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
is mainly related to

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
production enterprises.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
The most important criterion here

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
is the load of production capacity

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
at 90%. If your production capacity

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
is loaded at 90%, your sales channels

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
are formed optimally.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
That is, everything is fine.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
The attitude of customers to intermediaries.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
We have already talked about this,

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
that it is necessary to evaluate

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
at least once a year, to conduct such surveys

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
on key clients and ask

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
if they are satisfied, if everything is fine,

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
if there are any complaints about the work

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
of intermediaries. This is very important.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
The next is the costs of the enterprise organization

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
and the sales channel.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
We have already discussed

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
that you need to calculate everything,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
all costs completely.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And here are the costs for logistics,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
for advertising support, for technical,

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
for service, for business trips,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
for bonuses for sales managers.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
All commercial expenses

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
related to this sales channel

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
must be calculated.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
And in order not just to calculate them,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
but to assess their effectiveness,

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
you can apply the formula of profitability.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
How is it calculated?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
We take the revenue on this channel,

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
subtract all the costs from the household costs

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
and divide them by the household costs.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
The coefficient of profitability is obtained.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
The higher the coefficient of profitability,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
the better. If you compare all the channels,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
you will see which channels work

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
the most effectively.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And what are the recommendations

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
for increasing the effectiveness

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
of channel operation?

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
The first is to switch the enterprise

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
to the orientation of key clients.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Why is this important?

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Because we cannot provide everyone

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
with preferences,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
make the same support for everyone,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
communicate with everyone the same way.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
This is not necessary.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
These are additional expenses of the company.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Therefore, choose key clients

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
and work with them.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Assess their work

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
and always highlight them

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
so that they feel it.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Then you will have loyal clients

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
who will understand

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
that you are partners with them,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
not just a manufacturer

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
and distributor.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
This is the most important thing.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
The next point

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
that can be done

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
is to search for missed segments.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
What can be done here?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
See how other manufacturers

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
distribute their products on the market

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
or how it is distributed on the market.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
For example, climate technology

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
or thermal technology,

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
heat fans, heat guns

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
can be sold to transport enterprises,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
construction companies,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
to production companies

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
and other places.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
For example,

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
there is a certain distribution

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
of the market

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
by the channels' sales.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Compare the distribution of the market

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
and yours, where you do not refine,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
where you do not sell

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
your products

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
and you will see

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
your niche and potential.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
You have examples in your workbook.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
The next point

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
is to increase the efficiency

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
of the intermediaries.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
We do not touch key clients,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
we have highlighted them,

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
but there are standard clients.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
How to make them

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
to become key

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
and work better?

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Maybe change motivation,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
maybe add support,

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
maybe hold more joint events?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
You need to think about it.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
They do not need loyalty programs

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
that are aimed at key clients.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Nevertheless,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
support is important.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
The main thing is to determine the potential.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Can it be increased or not?

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
If not, leave it as it is.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
If it can be increased,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
we look at how it can be increased.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
The next point is to reduce sales costs.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
This is also an increase in the efficiency

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
of the sales channels.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
We look at the numbers

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
and decide whether we can reduce them.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
This is the most important point.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
To reduce, you need to calculate.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
The fifth point is to ensure

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
clear division of functions.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
We have already talked about it.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I repeat that it is very important

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
because duplication of functions is excluded

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
and resources are optimized.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Dear colleagues,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
today we have discussed

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
five main topics

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
that allow us

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
to effectively form

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
our distribution system.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
We have discussed the main trends

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
that exist on the market now.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
We have discussed

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
how the distribution system changes

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
depending on the market development.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
We have discussed the main strategies

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
and understood

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
which goods,

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
which companies

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
and on which life cycle

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
a particular strategy is effective.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
We have discussed the technology

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
of network development,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
the method of searching for new clients

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
in the regions and in the industries.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
We have discussed how to calculate

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
profitability and choose the best intermediary.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
We have seen two methods

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
of sales forecasting

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
that allow to forecast

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
your household activity

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
with minimal error.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
We have also seen

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
the methods of assessment,

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
efficiency and control of intermediaries.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Dear colleagues,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I wish you optimal channels,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
successful sales,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
high turnover

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
and, most importantly,

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
desired profits.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Good luck to you!

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
All the best! Goodbye!
