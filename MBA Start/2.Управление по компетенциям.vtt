00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
What does it mean?

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
It means that the staff knows that the competence model exists, it exists.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
But when it comes to the manager and says,

00:19.000 --> 00:32.000
determine what competencies are necessary for the future employee, the application to which you have submitted.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
The manager answers, listen, determine something yourself.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Well, you know, you know our specifics so well.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
You are not the first time you are looking for an employee for me.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Come up with something yourself.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
The manager nods his head, perhaps he comes up with something himself,

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
a certain model of competence that he has, or maybe not, and does everything as usual.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Thus, it is important to understand that the development of a competence model is only the beginning.

00:55.000 --> 01:06.000
The beginning before the future process of implementation, application and testing in our corporate practice.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
It is important to understand the following, that having this tool,

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
the staff manager can no longer say that he does not participate and is not responsible for the management decisions

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
regarding the employees who are hired.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I will give you the following example.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
Let's assume that the chief engineer of one of the enterprises is retiring and it is necessary to find a replacement.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
What did the chief engineer think about?

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Having worked in the company for many years, he said that there is one candidate, there is Vasya,

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
because Vasya has golden hands, he can do everything, and he is worthy of taking my place.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
What can happen after that?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Vasya can be appointed to a position.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Will he be successful? Will he not be successful? It is not clear.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
What other way of development can there be in this situation, if there is a competence model in the company?

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
The staff manager can offer several more candidates to his position together with the chief engineer.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
It can be Vasya, Petya and Fedya.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
The next step will be to evaluate the candidates' profile data.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
What is the competence profile?

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
Not the current position, in which they work, for example, as mechanics or someone else,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
but the profile of the position of the chief engineer.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
What is the profile of the position of the chief engineer?

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
In addition to professional competencies, it is a block of management competencies.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
Vasya has golden hands, and from the point of view of professional competencies, he is the best in the company.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
But this does not mean that his competence profile, from the point of view of the profile of the position of the chief engineer, will be better.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
And maybe Petya, who is number two, or number three,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
and whose hands are not golden, and he cannot fix something like Vasya,

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
from the point of view of management competencies, he will be the best, because he knows how to deal with people,

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
he knows how to set tasks, he understands a certain system of work in the service of the chief engineer,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and he understands how to improve it, optimize it, and so on.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Therefore, the best candidate of the three will be Petya.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
If we assign Vasya, then, perhaps, after some time, Vasya, having not worked with other managers,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
and he will already become the chief engineer, and he will be surrounded by line managers,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
with whom he used to work only as a subordinate.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
If he is not successful, what can be his fate?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Most likely, he will leave the company.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Yes, he is unlikely to return to his previous place.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Thus, we will lose a good mechanic and will not acquire a chief engineer.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
This is the case when a staff manager can participate in decision-making

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
and be responsible for their wrong decision.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
If the situation goes down the wrong path, then the care of a good specialist

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
can be blamed on the staff.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
Therefore, it is necessary to understand that using, having, using and using this tool,

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
we become responsible and participate in making all decisions that take place in the company.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
If we recall the staff management system, then the competence model,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
if it is developed uniformly for the entire company,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
what we called a core model some time ago,

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
which is used in all practices and procedures of staff management,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
it is applied in almost every direction.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
Once again, we select employees, we assess their behavior using competence,

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
we develop, we work with corporate culture when we formulate corporate competencies.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
Thus, in almost every direction, we use the competencies that we have created.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
I want to tell you about an interesting and necessary method in our activities.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
This is a method of paired comparison of competencies.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
When do we need it?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Look, we have developed 12 competencies,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
and we need to assess the employees of some department.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
There can be 30 employees.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Maybe more, maybe less, of course, but maybe more.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
To assess 30 employees of 12 competencies,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
it is necessary to spend a lot of time.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Therefore, the question always arises,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
what competencies are the most important?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Maybe we should focus on them?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
The same thing with selection.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The same 12 competencies.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
A large number of candidates must be interviewed.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And we always want to ask ourselves,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
what competencies are critical?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
What exactly can we refuse?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
What are we ready to learn within the company?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
What are we not ready to answer?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
What competencies do we buy from the market,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
inviting this specialist?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Thus, the question of arranging competencies arises.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And the method of paired comparison is very well applied.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
It is important to remember the following.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
We assess competencies for each other

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
for a certain position,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
which is necessary for the future period of time.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
We always appeal to the future,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
not to what is today,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
but to what will be needed tomorrow.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
What is this method?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Its essence is that each competency

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
is consistently compared with another.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Competencies are compared with each other

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
by asking the question,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
what is more important for an employee

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
to be successful in this position?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Which one? Competency 1 or Competency 2?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
If our answer is that it is more important to have Competency 1,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
then this competency is awarded 2 points.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
If we find it difficult to choose,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
because both competencies are important,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
then both competencies get 1 point each.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
If Competency 2 is more important,

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
and Competency 1, which we assess, is less important,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
then Competency 1 gets 0 points.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Let's look at this with you as an example.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I would like to draw your attention to the slide with an example.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
This slide consistently compares

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
5 competencies with each other.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Strategic thinking,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
team building, adaptation to changes,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
process management,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
and result-oriented.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
How do we do it?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Let's follow it and see together.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
First of all, a certain position is defined.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Let it be the position of the head of the staff,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
to illustrate our example.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
First of all, Competency 1 is compared to Competency 2.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Strategic thinking is compared to team building.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
What is the priority for this position?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
It is clear that each of you can answer in different ways.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
One will say that strategy is everything.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
The other will say that team is everything.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
We say that this is an example,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
and the goal of this example is to show how points are distributed in the table.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Therefore, in our example, these competencies are equally important.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Thus, Competency 1 is a strategic thinking.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
If we assess it,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
then we go from left to right.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
This competency gets 1 point.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
We see that in the cell we write 1.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
After that, we compare strategic thinking to the competency adaptation to changes.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
What do we see?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
These competencies are equally important.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Therefore, Competency 1 is 1 point.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
After that, we compare strategic thinking to the competency of process management.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
We see that Competency 1 is more important than process management for the head of the staff.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Thus, Strategic Thinking gets 2 points.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
After that, we compare Competency 2 with the last competency,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
which is the result-oriented.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
We see that the result-oriented is more important.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Therefore, Strategic Thinking gets 0 points.

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
Thus, in our analysis, Strategic Thinking got 4 points.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
After that, we go down to the line and start analyzing the creation of the team.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
We compare the team with the strategic thinking.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
We see it and write 1 there.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
After that, we compare the team with the adaptation to changes.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
We see that the team-creation competency is more important.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Therefore, it gets 2 points, and the adaptation to changes gets 0.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Also, the team-creation is more important than process management,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
but less important than the result-oriented.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Accordingly, we assign 2 and 0 points.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Thus, the team-creation competency in total gets 5 points.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
We go down to the line and start analyzing the adaptation to changes.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
We have already compared it with the strategic thinking,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
the team-creation, and now we have to compare it with only 2 competencies.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Process management and the result-oriented.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
We say that in comparison with both competencies,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
the adaptation to changes competencies are equally important.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Therefore, they get 1 point each.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
The total point that the adaptation to changes gets is 3 points.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's move on to the process management.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
We have to compare the process management only with the result-oriented,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
because we have already compared it with all other competencies.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
It was not important in comparison with the strategic thinking and the team-creation.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
It got 1 point when it was about the adaptation to changes.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Accordingly, comparing it with the result-oriented,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
the process management gets 2 points, because it is the most important.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
In total, the process management gets 3 points.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Once again, this is an example.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
In a company, for a certain position,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
the result-oriented will be more important than the process management.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
This is an example to illustrate this method.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
When we get to the result-oriented,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
we have already compared this competency with all other competencies.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
We remember that it was more important than the strategic thinking,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
than the team-creation.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
It was about the adaptation to changes and gave way to the process management.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
In total, this competency got 5 points.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
Thus, we have two competencies that are the priority in this list.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
What are these competencies?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
These are the competencies that got 5 points.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
They are the team-creation and the result-oriented.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Thus, out of the five competencies that we have,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
we have determined two of the most important.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Maybe we needed three of the most important.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Then, this competency will be the strategic thinking,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
which got 4 points.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Please note that we use this method

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
to determine the priority competencies for a specific position.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
For example, these are two priority competencies

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
for the position of the head of the staff.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
For the position of the logistics manager,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
the priority competencies may be completely different.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Using this method, we make our activities a little easier.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
If we need to find a specialist for this position,

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
we will understand that these competencies are the priority competencies.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
It is important for us that a person is a team player,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
that he can create a team, and we will teach him the rest.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
If he is not a team player,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
then, unfortunately, the level of development will not be high,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and he will not join our company.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
We will not make him an offer.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
We start talking about the application of competencies in our companies.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
We start talking about the evaluation of the staff,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
about the use of competencies when conducting evaluation procedures.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
What are the goals of evaluation activities?

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
The first goal is to evaluate the current level of competence development,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
the required level, and its compliance.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
The second goal is to select people for the future staff reserve

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
and create individual development plans for them.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
The next goal is to create a training program for employees

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
based on the results of evaluation activities.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
The next goal is to correct compensation packages

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
for employees who have successfully completed evaluation activities.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
As we have already discussed at the very beginning,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
there is no single terminology in our professional community.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Therefore, in literature,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
you can often find terms that are equated as synonyms.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Evaluation of activity, evaluation of competencies, etc.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
In fact, at least for yourself,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
it is necessary to understand that evaluation procedures are divided.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Either we evaluate the activity,

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
which in English sounds like performance appraisal,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
we evaluate the effectiveness of our employees.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
And the second is when we evaluate their behavior.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That is, evaluation of competencies.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Or we conduct an assessment center,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
as we have already discussed,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
taking this word for Russian,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and taking it into our professional language.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
In our companies, these things can go hand in hand.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
We evaluated a little how the employee achieved his results

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
and the goals that were set by his manager in the past.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
And we evaluate competencies for a long time.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Again, it all depends on our tasks.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
But it is important to remember that evaluation of activity is what?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And it answers the question, what did the employee do?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Evaluation of competencies answers the question,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
how were these results achieved?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
When we combine these two assessments,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
we get very important information.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Let's imagine a situation when the head of the department comes,

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
let's say sales, since we often mention this department today,

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
and says that something is not sold well,

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
the plan is always fulfilled 80-85%.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It seems to be being fulfilled, and not the worst indicator,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
but something is not reaching.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Conduct a training, and he provides a request to the staff manager.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
The staff manager, having taken this request,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
starts to call training companies,

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
and training companies come and conduct training for employees of the sales department.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Probably, what is important, they adapt it to a specific specificity.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Is it a real option?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Of course, it is real.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
It often happens.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Often.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
But if we use the assessment of competencies,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
what can we see?

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
We can see that the department in general fulfills the plan 80-85%, as we said.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
But each of the department employees lacks something of their own.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
One person knows the product poorly, he is constantly confused.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Another person knows the product well, but when the client says it is expensive,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
he falls into a stupor and cannot answer anything,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
thinking about himself that it is really expensive.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
That is, he does not know how to work with objections.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Another person, having carried out a single sale,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
cannot establish a relationship with the client.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
He starts looking for new ones,

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
and thus the post-sale service is not performed well and efficiently.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Thus, if we assess the competencies of the employees of this department,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
we will see a different level of development of different competencies.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
And by and large, we will offer this manager not a single program for everyone,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
but we will show that each employee lacks something of their own.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
And by and large, each employee should be sent to either his own training,

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
or specific things should be paid attention to in his work.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
This is the situation when we will talk about individual development plans.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Therefore, once again, we will talk about the assessment of competencies today.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
That is, exactly how.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
This assessment of competencies should always be carried out in a system of assessment of staff,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
where the assessment of activity is an important element.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
That is, what was achieved.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
So, when conducting assessment events, we must meet several conditions.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
First of all, we need to determine the goal for which we are conducting the assessment.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
What results we want to get and how we will use these results.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
We must always remember that assessment events are not conducted for themselves,

18:04.000 --> 18:11.000
but for some subsequent actions for the purpose of making some management decision.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
Next, it is important that the selected assessment procedures meet the goals.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
We will talk about the procedures a little later, including methods.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Next, it is important that there are competent people, competent assessors.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
This can be both internal specialists and external specialists.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
In any case, those who will assess our employees should have competencies in this area.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
It often happens that employees of the staff do everything, and select, and train, and assess.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Probably, there are such specialists, but still there are not so many of them.

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
Therefore, it is important to ensure that our task is that the professionals are engaged in assessment.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Next, it is important to conduct preliminary explanatory work with employees.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Explain to them the goals of the assessment, explain their benefits, what they can get.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
I do not recommend you to do an assessment that can involve some,

19:13.000 --> 19:19.000
especially the first time, unpopular management decisions.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Do not give, do not fire, and so on.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
Although it is not so simple, nevertheless, when employees know that they will not get something,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
it is better to always go the other way around.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
What can an employee get, what are his benefits, so that he participates and does not resist these procedures.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
Next, it is a qualitative preparation of content, that is, their cases, exercises, role-playing games, and so on.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
We will talk about them a little now.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So, what are the methods of assessment?

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
There are many methods, different methods, many of them you know.

19:55.000 --> 20:03.000
The first is the filling of assessment sheets or conducting a survey with a 360-degree method.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
What is 360 degrees?

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
This is a situation when an employee is assessed by the manager, his colleague, his subordinate,

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
if he has one, and the employee assesses himself.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
That is, a kind of circular assessment.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
In this case, if we have competencies, then the employee is assessed according to the competencies.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
When we are in the assessment sheets, we provide all the indicators that we have developed,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
and we ask to choose our evaluators, managers, whether it is a colleague or a subordinate,

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
what kind of employee you assess, what behavior he shows in his work.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
And those who assess, they indicate.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
The value of this assessment is that it is most often objective.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Of course, it happens when a subordinate wants to flatter the manager,

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
or the manager, having a certain tooth on the subordinate, can somehow lower the rating.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
In any case, when it comes to assessment, let's say, from four sides,

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
the assessment will be balanced in some way, and we will receive information for analysis.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
The next is an interview.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
What kind of interview?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
An interview, again, on competencies.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
When the interviewer sits down with the employee and begins to ask him questions

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
about the situations that were in his professional life,

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
which took place, with questions about how this person behaved at one time or another,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
what was the result of this behavior.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
The goal of this interview is to gather the standards of behavior,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
how a person behaves most often.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
If we assess the managerial competencies of an employee,

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
and in his story there are few examples of how he showed these management competencies,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
we can draw two conclusions.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
The first is that the employee is not developed for some reason.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
But there may be another conclusion,

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
that the employee does not have the opportunity to apply these competencies in our organization.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
We taught him, taught him, taught him.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
He can, but we did not give him resources.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
He has no one to manage.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Thus, we will take this into account,

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
and in subsequent exercises, using other methods of assessment,

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
we will see how in a certain game, when solving certain tasks,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
how the employee will show himself and his competencies in this situation.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
The next method is testing.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Either we test to assess professional knowledge,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
and then it is from the field of professional competencies,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
as a first step.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Our goal is to understand whether employees do this,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
but first we assess whether he knows what to do and how to do it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Or these are psychological tests,

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
which are often used by specialists who know how to do it.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Or these are psychological tests,

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
which are also used as tools in our work.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
The next method is solving tasks or cases.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Most often these are individual exercises,

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
these are individual tasks, either written tasks or oral tasks,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
when it is necessary to analyze a situation,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
to offer your vision, to offer your decision.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Based on this, we, acting as assessors,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
can draw conclusions about the preparation,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
about the professional preparation of the employee,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
if it was a task on a professional topic,

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
and about what competencies he has in the field of information analysis,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
and in the field of information presentation,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
if, for example, at the end of this task,

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
he has to make a presentation to the assessment commission.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
The next method is games.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Games can be business or role-playing.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
What is the essence of a role-playing game?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
A role-playing game is, most often, a game

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
in which we analyze a certain invented situation,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
which we set for ourselves.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
We analyze the working, professional behavior of an employee.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
If he works with clients,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
then, accordingly, the role-playing game will be his,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
as a manager, let's say, for sales and a client.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
If we have a task to assess the communication competencies of the manager,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
then we create a role-playing game

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
in which the manager communicates with the manager,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and they must protect their interests,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
achieve their goals,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
and at the same time jointly achieve a compromise.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
A very important point is that

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
if we are preparing a role-playing game,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
then we must prescribe both roles.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
It is clear that these roles will contradict each other in their interests.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
There will always be their minimum and maximum.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Nevertheless, these things need to be coordinated

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
so that neither one of the heroes,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
who we assess,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
nor the one who plays and helps him in this exercise,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
has less opportunities for improvisation.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
The game did not go in any way.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
It is important that if we assess the communication and professional competencies,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
how a person will act in a specific situation,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
with the given resources to achieve the goals that are determined.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
These are role-playing games.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
When it comes to business games,

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
most often we mean games in which a group of people participates,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
a group of assessors.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
They have one common task,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
which they must solve,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
the goal which they must achieve.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
The so-called simulation games are very popular now.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
That is, a business situation, a business task,

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
in which a group of participants represents one company,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
which is often fictional,

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
and which must achieve the goals with the resources they have.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
This method is gaining more and more popularity

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
and is being used very actively to assess the leaders of the middle and upper ranks.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Because during such games,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
the leaders are very open,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
and we can observe their behavior.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
The next method is group exercises or discussions.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
When it is necessary to discuss a task,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
or discuss a situation,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
come to a single decision,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
or when a controversy is organized on a controversial topic,

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
it is necessary to understand how the participants participate in such group discussions

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
and solve group exercises.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
It is very important that during assessment procedures

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
it is important to assess the behavior that is really observable,

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
and not to think why the employee behaves in a proper way,

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
that is, not to analyze hypotheses about his reasons.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Thus, in a group of experts,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
when an assessment commission is formed,

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
both internal specialists and specialists from the outside are often attracted.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
On the one hand, the internal specialist knows a lot,

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
he knows the corporate spirit, he knows the environment, he knows corporate slang,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
and he will be an assistant in the event of a situation

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
when the same behavior can be interpreted in different ways.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
For example, we will call one person an economist,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
if he is our friend,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and if he is not our friend,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
how can we call him?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
We can call him a miser.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
The characteristics are different,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
but the observed behavior can be similar.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
It is the internal experts who will help us identify the observed behavior in a proper way,

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
and the external experts will help us, let's say,

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
to be free from the story that we know about the participants.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
When you look and understand that in life he behaves differently,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
probably he is tired, or has not slept,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
or has not yet understood where he is,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
but he is actually different.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
An external expert will never allow us to do this,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
he will always rely on the behavior he observes,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
and will pay our attention to this.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Very often in literature we meet and talk about such a method as a center of assessment.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
What is a center of assessment?

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
First of all, this term is a translation of the English term assessment center,

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
which we also use in our professional terminology.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
It is important to understand that the classical assessment center,

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
which was introduced in Russia about 10 years ago by leading Western consulting companies,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
includes a certain set of exercises.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
This is a kind of a set of methods,

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
thanks to which we assess the behavior and the level of competence development that employees have.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
Now, in corporate practice, we understand different things under the assessment center.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
We combine two different methods and call it an assessment.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
Nevertheless, there are some standards of the assessment center,

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
which should be taken into account even when we adapt it to our corporate tasks.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Most often, the assessment lasts 1-2 days.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
The assessment is carried out based on the model of competence that exists.

29:23.000 --> 29:30.000
Assessment is practically impossible to conduct without formulated competencies.

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
Next, competencies must be interconnected with the success of the work.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
These are not just some competencies taken from somewhere,

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
these are the competencies that ensure the successful performance of the work.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
How many participants can be?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
There should be no more than 7 participants,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
otherwise it will be difficult to observe them.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
Or it can be 2 times 7, if we are talking about two groups and a large number of participants that we need to assess.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
It is important to remember that there is such a concept as an individual assessment center,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
in which one employee participates.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
When can this be?

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Most often, we use it when selecting staff.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
When our company invites a top manager to work,

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
and we know a lot about his professional competencies,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
because he is known on his market,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
and we attract him with the help of the agency,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
we should not make a mistake,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
because the cost of the mistake will be quite high.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
And we can offer, if we have a need for this,

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
to order an individual assessment center for this top manager,

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
during which we will assess his management and corporate competencies,

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
how much their level corresponds to our company.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
For example, he can tell us during the interview that he is a team player,

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
that the interests of the team are the most important for him.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
And this can correspond to what we have, and we want to hear it.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
If the center is well organized, it is likely that it will not be conducted.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
And we can see that this is not the person who,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
having reached the gates, using football terminology,

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
will give the last pass and score a goal for his teammate.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
He will still strive to do it himself.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
And so we will see that a person declares that he is interested in work,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
he declares his team spirit.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Maybe he even wants to be like that.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
Nevertheless, in his work, he is an individualist and tries to do everything himself.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
This is a good quality, but in our example, not for our position.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
This is about the number of participants.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
Next, the observers, that is, the assessors,

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
if we use American terminology.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
There should be several observers, not one or two.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
It is clear that their number directly depends on the number of participants.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
If this is an individual assessment, then there will be enough two observers.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
If these are groups, then most often there are three, four, five,

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
among which, I repeat, there are both involved specialists from outside,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
and our internal employees.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
What do the observers do?

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
The observers analyze the behavior that the participants of the assessment center

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
show during the exercises.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
And everyone observes no more than two participants.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
Because it's not that easy to observe, interpret, analyze the behavior you see.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
Sometimes in different exercises, observers change participants.

32:52.000 --> 32:59.000
It's not that the observer takes two participants and looks at them for two days.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
No, in this exercise, he looks at these two, in the next exercise, he looks at others.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
It is important to understand that, as we have already said,

33:10.000 --> 33:18.000
the success of assessment procedures depends on the fulfillment of the exercises that our employees solve.

33:18.000 --> 33:27.000
Therefore, more than 90% of the exercises should imitate professional activity.

33:27.000 --> 33:35.000
And a maximum of 5-10% can be psychological exercises.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
Because, again, our task is to assess the work behavior.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
And we can assess the work behavior by creating the most characteristic conditions,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
that is, the environment in which employees work every day.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
The execution of each exercise, of course, is limited in time.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
And in each exercise there are no more than four competencies.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
Even if we try to analyze eight competencies,

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
which we have determined and included in our corporate model,

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
in any case, one exercise demonstrates no more than four.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
And, no less important, each competence must be checked in several exercises, in two or three.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
We can see, for example, how the employee behaves during the group work,

34:21.000 --> 34:31.000
analyze, look, then recheck our suspicions, our thoughts about how he behaved in another exercise,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and in this one he behaves the same.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
And if his behavior is repeated, then we can say that, yes,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
competencies are demonstrated at this level.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
If the behavior changes for some reason,

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
maybe he was first constrained, squeezed, and then realized that there was nothing wrong,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
and opened up completely,

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
then we just suggest and observe his behavior in various exercises more closely.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
An important recommendation is that each participant must be provided with feedback.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Feedback can be different.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
It can be a well-prepared and structured plan of individual development,

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
or just a few words about what a person should pay attention to.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
But in any case, feedback should be there,

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
and the more it is, the better it is for our project.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
Let's talk about what exercises we use when holding the assessment center.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
First of all, it can be group exercises or individual exercises.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
If we talk about group exercises,

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
then it can be two types of exercises that we use most often.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
These are exercises with distributed roles and with non-distributed roles.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
What's the difference?

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
The difference is that if in the case of a group exercise with non-distributed roles,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
the task is received by a group,

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
and the task of the observer is to analyze how each of the participants behaves

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
in a situation that is not specifically set for him, but for the group.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
And then the participants are analyzed.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Who will organize the group and say,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
do as I do, write on the flip chart, go there, take this, and so on.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
Who will be the most silent, but at the end will say three phrases

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
that will change the course of the group's work,

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
and the group will make a decision and see this person.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
In this case, if the roles are distributed,

36:29.000 --> 36:36.000
then this is a situation when the roles that are offered to the participants are a little contradictory.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
And everyone has their own goal,

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
it can be a common group, it can be within the group,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
when the participants need to agree with each other,

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
have the resources that are set, and have some restrictions that also exist.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
Individual exercises can also be different.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
It can be either a presentation,

36:57.000 --> 37:04.000
when the participant needs to familiarize himself with the package of information provided,

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
he needs to analyze this information and make a decision,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
presenting it to the evaluation commission.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
It can be a role-playing game,

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
which refers to individual exercises, which we have already talked about.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
It can be an exercise to find facts,

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
when the participant is given a brief description of a problem,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
a situation that needs to be solved,

37:27.000 --> 37:33.000
and he has the opportunity to ask a number of questions to the members of the evaluation commission,

37:33.000 --> 37:41.000
asking for the necessary information that he needs to solve this exercise.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
It can be an individual business exercise,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
which is called an intray,

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
or you can look up the name in the Internet and in the literature,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
as in a basket or in a folder.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
The point is that the participant receives a certain package of information,

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
it can be of completely different types,

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
and his task is to solve the task that is set for him.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
For example, it can be our reservist,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
whom we are preparing for the role of the future leader.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Thus, he receives some information,

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
some correspondence, some documentation of his internal leader.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
If the leader is not present and he is on a business trip,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
he needs to analyze all the information and solve it.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
It can be within the framework of one unit,

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
when there is a task to answer,

38:35.000 --> 38:42.000
the client asks for a discount or he has stopped the supply of products.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
It is necessary to identify whether the decision was made correctly or incorrectly,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
and in the absence of imitation,

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
it is necessary to read the documents that confirm and illustrate

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
the history of cooperation with this client,

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
and assess whether it was a right decision or not,

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
and take responsibility for his acceptance.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
The question is,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
all this is great, the exercises are different,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
where to get them from?

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
If the task is to hold an assessment center for reservists

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
and select candidates for the personnel reserve,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
where to get the exercises?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
There are several options.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
If you invite professionals, professional consultants,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
representatives of consulting or training companies,

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
your partners will come with a package of exercises,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
which they will either use,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
or when certain agreements are reached,

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
they will leave them for your future work.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
Very often consultants develop exercises with you,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
helping you do this,

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
already adapting the existing exercises to your corporate practice.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
If you want to do it yourself,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
you will never find the exercises that you need.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Develop them.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
The question is who develops them?

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
Again, together with the managers and leading experts.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Because all the most difficult situations that could happen,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
many of them have already happened.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And there is always a story.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Do you remember how difficult it was,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
what conflict arose, how we solved it?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And there are always such stories,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
practically legends in all departments.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Therefore, the task of the staff is to describe them

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
and create some exercises from them.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Be it an exercise to find facts,

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
or describe some role-playing game,

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
or to come up with a situation for analysis,

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
in order to understand how the future participant of the assessment center

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
will act in a given situation.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
It is clear that if you send a letter to the manager,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
saying that you need to describe how it all happened,

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
because you need it for your future exercise,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
probably not everyone will answer,

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
because it is not always easy to formulate and write.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Therefore, it is advisable to work together.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It can be a specialist of the staff,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
it can be a specialist engaged in training,

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
who simply comes with certain guiding questions to the manager

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
and just collects these examples.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
And after a while you will have your own library of exercises,

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
which you will periodically update,

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
periodically you will add the most interesting exercises,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
exclude something and modify them.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
Then you can say that a certain library has been developed,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
a certain portfolio of tasks that you use

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
to assess your competencies in completely different exercises.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
As a result of such activity in the development of exercises,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
you should get a certain matrix of assessment.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
I would like to draw your attention to the slide that you see now.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
When the entire list of competencies that you have is presented,

42:03.000 --> 42:09.000
8, 10, 12, and the exercises that are available will be determined,

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
you will always be able to understand which competence,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
which methods you have the opportunity to assess.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I would like to draw your attention to the slide,

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
where, as an example, the competence of working with clients is given,

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
and the methods of assessment that the company has in stock are listed.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
This is from the filling of the assessment sheet,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
the method is 360 degrees,

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
and as we see that instead of the subordinate, the client participates here,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
assesses the employee.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
This can be a written assessment of the knowledge of the assortment and the work technique,

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
work with clients, that is, an assessment of knowledge.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
This is a business game that is developed based on the situation that took place.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
And also this is a case that is offered to the participants to decide.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
Again, someone else for this competence can offer some other methods.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
Maybe there will be only two of them, maybe three, they will be completely different.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
In this case, in this example, we see a choice of a specific company.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
When the staff understands that in order to assess the competence of working with our employees,

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
these methods are available.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
So, we have assessed our employees.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
We have laid out the required level of development or profile of the position on our axes,

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
on which we have laid out the competence, drew webs,

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
and then applied the current level of development of our employees' competences.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
We receive information for analysis, and we need to use this information.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
How can we use it?

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
We can either make an individual plan and programs for each employee.

43:49.000 --> 43:56.000
We determine which employees we will represent in the personnel reserve.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.000
Speaking of the personnel reserve, it is important to understand that if we define this group for ourselves,

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
the group can be very large, or the positions can be different.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
This does not mean that we have presented the whole group in the reserve for all positions.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Absolutely not.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
We remember that in order to be listed in the personnel reserve and for subsequent development,

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
it is necessary to assess, or to impose the assessment that we have made,

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
but already to impose on the competence profile the position under which we select the reserve.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
This does not mean that everything is again, everything is from the beginning.

44:32.000 --> 44:42.000
If we represent an employee in the reserve, in the higher position,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
then these are positions within the same group of positions.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
Therefore, there will be the same corporate competences, the same professional competences.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
The only thing that can be added is management competences,

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
if the employee did not engage in management activities in the previous position.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
Thus, we can or plan to list the people we are listing in the personnel reserve.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
We propose to give them another exercise,

45:10.000 --> 45:16.000
within which we will observe the level of development of their management competences for subsequent assessment.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
The next is the planning of the employee's career.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
This is an opportunity that we have, and we can understand and give the employee feedback

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
so that he understands what he can expect while working in our company.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
The next is the adjustment of compensation packages.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
I say this because the word adjustment is very soft,

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
it is by no means a change in compensation packages.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
What does it mean?

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
I do not recommend you to change the labor payment system,

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
to increase the salary based on the results of the assessment on competences,

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
because we pay for the result, and competences are still behavior.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
We should not pay for the behavior demonstrated, no matter how it sounds.

46:00.000 --> 46:07.000
It is clear that if the assessment on competences coincides with the assessment on activity,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
then it can be the next step.

46:09.000 --> 46:17.000
In any case, be careful, remember that only for the results of the assessment center,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
compensation packages should not be changed easily.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
There should be another reason for this.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
Let's talk about the use of competences in the development of the staff.

46:26.000 --> 46:33.000
We did a lot of work, we evaluated, and we understand that there is a group of employees

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
with a number of competences that we need to improve.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
We all together, it is clear that they need to be improved,

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
but we, if we are a staff service, need to create an environment

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
and provide the tools that will help employees do this.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
First of all, we develop special training programs,

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
whether individual or group, for the development of competences.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
We can do this within our training centers, or within the company,

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
or we can attract external partners to achieve these goals.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
There are many methods of training, they are different.

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
They are different in quality, they are different in duration, they are different in cost.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
Again, from these methods, we choose those that are acceptable

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
for the development of specific competences of specific employees in our companies.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
Thus, we will get the so-called development action menu,

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
or individual development plans.

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
When for the development of a certain competence, we have certain methods.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Remember, we had an assessment matrix there.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
How can we assess competences?

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
The same thing here, the matrix of development actions.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
How can we develop this competence?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
What methods do we have?

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
The methods can be completely different.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
It can be self-learning, it can be mentorship,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
as one of the most effective methods.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
It can be participation in development projects,

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
training and seminar.

48:12.000 --> 48:18.000
It can be participation or even holding some master classes,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
most likely inside the company.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
It's not that we send an employee to train someone.

48:24.000 --> 48:30.000
But we say that if he has some professional knowledge,

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
and on the other hand, he needs to develop competences related to communication,

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
work, let's say, a speech in front of an audience, and so on,

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
why not share his knowledge in this format?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
It can be a development center.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
We talked about assessment centers.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
But there is also such a concept as a development center.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
The point is that the algorithm of conduct is similar,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
as we said about the assessment center,

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
but the goal is different.

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
The goal is not to assess, but to train during its implementation.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
When an employee performs an exercise,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
he immediately receives feedback.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
And then, within the framework of the development center,

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
he receives another exercise and an opportunity to demonstrate and improve his skills.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
The goal is not just to collect some information,

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
but to let the employee try to change his behavior

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
taking into account the feedback he received from the observers.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
It is important to remember that employees with high grades,

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
that is, with a high level of competence, regardless of their position,

49:41.000 --> 49:47.000
can and should perform as functional coaches and mentors.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
Moreover, this is a great advantage for the company

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
when the most valuable knowledge can be passed from one employee to another.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
This is also a plus for the employee, a kind of advantage,

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
because it is related to his inner motivation,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
including the fact that he becomes an internal or functional coach.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
Not to mention that if the company has a mentor motivation system,

50:10.000 --> 50:16.000
it will always be an additional benefit.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
Speaking of competence development,

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
we cannot help but talk about the competencies that are difficult to develop.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Some people call them undeveloped competencies,

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
but this name probably has a certain predisposition,

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
because if we call it competence,

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
we must accept that what has grown has grown.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
What level of competence does the employee have?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
We should always work with this.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Of course, there is a part of irony in this,

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
because undeveloped competencies are those competencies

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
within which it is quite difficult to change a person.

50:51.000 --> 50:56.000
Nevertheless, we must understand whether such competencies exist in our model.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Loyalty.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
How can we evaluate it?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
How will we develop it?

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
How will we tell a person to be loyal if we want him to behave like this?

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It's not that simple.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Such competencies can be different.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
For example, the competence of creativity.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Competencies are not often found.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
It can be either in some small creative organizations,

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
or it can be a professional competence of some group of employees.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
Nevertheless, at the stage of formulating competence,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
remembering and answering the question

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
how we can analyze and whether we can develop this competence in the future,

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
it is worth thinking about it in some way.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
And, accordingly, later just understand that this is one of such competencies.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
Therefore, what tools do we have?

51:44.000 --> 51:50.000
The first is to analyze and select people at the entrance to the company for these competencies.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
That is, not to miss people who do not have the level that we need

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
if this competence is a priority.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Also, develop a system of stimulation.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
If we use not only development tools,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
but tools from another field,

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
that is, the behavior that we think is necessary.

52:09.000 --> 52:14.000
And also, again, try to determine the methods that may be.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Among which there may be coaching,

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
among which there must be feedback.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
If a person is interested in developing this competence,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
if he has an inner desire,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
then this method will be very effective,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
because he will receive feedback

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
either from a colleague, from a manager,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
or from some internal expert.

52:33.000 --> 52:40.000
And he will change and consciously change his activity in the direction that is necessary.

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
A few words about the personnel reserve, which we have already talked about today.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
First of all, it is necessary to determine for ourselves what we understand as a personnel reserve.

52:50.000 --> 52:56.000
Historically, we understand the personnel reserve as a reserve for a position,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
for any of the positions.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
It can be either a management reserve,

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
that is, when specialists are formed,

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
reservists are formed for the position of a manager,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
or from the manager of the lower link

53:10.000 --> 53:17.000
a reserve is formed for the position of a higher level manager.

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
Nevertheless, there is a concept that has become part of our language today,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
which we read a lot in literature.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
This is the management of talents.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
When we form the so-called talent pool,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
what is it about?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
Is there any difference?

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
Most often, those companies that adhere to this principle

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
and say that we are not just forming a reserve for some position.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
No, we select talented specialists from different fields.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
We evaluate them, determining talent for ourselves in some way,

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
and most often as a potential for development.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
We already understand that this is a certain set of competencies.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
We determine these people for ourselves

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
in order to pay more attention to them during our work with the personnel

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
and understand that this is our future

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
and that it is more convenient for us to invest in this particular category of employees.

54:12.000 --> 54:17.000
In this case, the talent pool is not for a specific position.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
There is no profile of the competence of the chief engineer,

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
the reserve for which we are forming.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
There is a certain scope for the future,

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
or a certain profile of success, as some companies call it.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
Thus, it is necessary to determine the direction in which we work.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Either we have a reserve for a position,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
or for a managerial position,

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
or for a position of a specialist, a rare specialist,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
who is almost not on the market.

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
Let's say a technologist in our tricky production.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
And we grow all technologists on our own.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
Or, once again, a talent pool.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
In any case, we understand that we select candidates

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
for the pool and the reserve based on the results of evaluation events.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
We create individual development plans.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
Only if we understand what to include in the development plan,

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
because there is a profile of the position,

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
in the reserve for which they are included,

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
and we understand, comparing with their current profile of the position,

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
what competencies need to be developed.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
As for the talent pool,

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
we are talking about a certain profile of success.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
When we set a certain level,

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
maybe we draw the profile of a young manager,

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
or we define it for ourselves in some other way.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
And we start from this profile,

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
which we have defined for ourselves.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
For reservists, individual plans are made.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
It is very important that people,

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
who are listed in the reserve or in the talent pool,

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
are not just listed once,

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
but then, in a year, two or three,

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
to see what happened to them.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
These are people, for whom we invest more money

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
from the calculation for one employee than for other employees.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
Therefore, we need to constantly monitor the effectiveness of our investments.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
What does it mean?

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
This is the level of reserve preparation.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
We gave recommendations to employees about what to do.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
Did any change happen or not?

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
This is something that must be monitored.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
There are two aspects.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
The first is that our reserve group is very slow and fast.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
If our reserve is medium-term,

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
for example, for three years,

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
and we prepared it for a year,

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
but in a year we do not need ready specialists in this area,

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
what can happen?

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
Everything can turn out great,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
the employee will say thank you,

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
straighten his wings and continue his career in another organization.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
Therefore, you must feel this balance,

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
initially programming the reserve period for which we are preparing.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
The benefits that the organization gets

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
when forming and developing a personnel reserve cannot be overestimated.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
First of all, we must understand

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
that this is a systematic and targeted development

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
of a certain group of employees.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
The money is invested in the best.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
We do everything to maximize the return on these investments.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
The reservists themselves understand

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
what the company expects from them

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
if they have individual plans or plans for future careers.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Thus, the best of them aim to develop

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
in accordance with these expectations.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Further, the corporate culture of the company

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
is gradually changing.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
It becomes oriented towards personal development,

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
initiative, creativity.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
In the hands of the line managers and the staff,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
a real tool for working with employees

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
and increasing their loyalty and involvement in business appears.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
There is also a very important

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
transition of the personnel service

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
to a different quality level of development.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Thus, both the organization

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
and the personnel service

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
as a guide and an agent of such changes win.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
Let's pay attention to the next slide

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
where the cycle of corporate training

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
or training system is presented.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
We will touch on this issue again

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
in our today's topic

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
– the competence model.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
Very often, we have to develop

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
the training system.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
The first step is to analyze

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
the needs of the employees.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
There are many methods of analysis of needs.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
One of them is the assessment of competence.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
As a result, you often see

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
HR and personnel specialists

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
making a conspiracy to assess competence.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
We also have to develop the competence model.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Then they either start the big way

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
we are talking about today

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
or they use some other methods.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
In fact, the most valid and objective

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
is the assessment of competence.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
If we have this competence,

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
we can easily make this step.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
All the needs of the training

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
become clear and obvious

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
and we can work with them.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
The next element of the system

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
is the planning of the training.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
We need to understand who, how and when we will be teaching.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
The next step is to develop the program

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
and how we will develop the competence.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
The next step is to develop the training.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
The next step is to assess the effectiveness.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
The assessment of the effectiveness

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
is the final element of the system.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Let's recall the methods

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
for assessing the effectiveness of the training.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
When we talk about the assessment of the effectiveness

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
we often mention the name

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
of Donald Kirkpatrick

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
who 30 years ago proposed

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
the technology of assessing the effectiveness of the training.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Now we know it as the Kirkpatrick model

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
or the 4-level model.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
What is its essence?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Let's recall.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
When we talk about the assessment of the effectiveness

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
of the training or some training program

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
we should ask ourselves what we assess.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Do we assess the training

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
which lasted for 16 hours?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Or do we assess the coach

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
or the participants?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
We always ask this question.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Our task is not to assess the program

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
but to assess the changes

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that the training has brought.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The changes in the work of the participants

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
should have led to the goal

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
for which the training program was conceived.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Kirkpatrick proposed to do the following.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
First, he said

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
to assess the reaction of the students

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
i.e. emotions.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
After the seminar, let's ask

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
how the participants felt.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Did they like the program?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Did they feel the heat?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Did they feel cold?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Did they have a proper lunch?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
This is an assessment of emotions.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Let's take a look at the sports.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
We can listen to a lecture

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
of a great football coach

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
and we can say that it was great.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
We spent 2-3 hours with such a positive feeling.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
We say that it was great.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
It is an emotion.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
We need to understand

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
what is left in the participants' heads.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
We remember our football lecture.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Do we remember the main rules?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Or is there some inner feeling

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
about a well-spent time?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
If the football lecture can be like this,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
it should not be like this.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Our next task is to understand

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
what knowledge is left in the participants' heads.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
If we taught operators of the call center

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
to work effectively, we need to understand

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
that they liked everything.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
They left with the feeling

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
that they had a great time.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
This was not the goal.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The next level is that there is not enough knowledge.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
We can play football,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
but none of us will ever go out on the pitch.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
We can work with objections.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
A manager can sigh a lot

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and say that he has been through a lot of trainings

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
and he will go back to the same place.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
But knowledge does not always imply skill.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
We know how to do it.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
We can work with people.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
The next level is the level of behavior.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
How much behavior has changed

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
after the training.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
What is behavior? It is competence.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
We understand that this is the most fixed change

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
in the development of competence

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
that we can analyze.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Has there been a change?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
No.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
It is easier for those companies

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
that have competence models

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
to reach the third level of efficiency.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
We have all the tools.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
We developed, we conducted

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
assessment centers, we evaluated, we looked.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
We saw what was at the entrance.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
After repeating the procedures,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
we can analyze if there are any changes.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Can we make changes to the training program

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
that we conducted?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The next point is

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
how the fourth level of efficiency

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
and the business results

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
led to new behavior.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
The operators of our call center

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
that we trained and liked

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
started to serve the client better.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
What did it lead to?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It led to more clients.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Clients became more satisfied with our call center.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
This is a business result

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
that we record and that is a consequence

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
of competence development.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
To conclude the topic of competence use

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
in the development of staff,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
the company receives the competence

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
from the employees.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
In those companies where the staff

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
uses competence to form the system

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
of training and development of employees,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
the employees themselves clearly understand

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
what competence is necessary for their career growth.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
They understand what they need to do

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
to make their work evaluated positively.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
The employees have a clear idea

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
of what their employees were trained for.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
They clearly understand

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
what they can demand from their employees.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
The staff receives a good tool

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
to evaluate the effectiveness of the investments

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
that are invested in training.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Let's talk about the use of competence

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
in the selection of staff.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
We can evaluate the competence

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
of a certain employee in 40 minutes,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
an hour, or an hour and a half.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
We have a limited time.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
We didn't know anything about the employee before.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
There is no history of our relations.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The evaluation should be as accurate as possible.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
We should make every effort

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
not to make a mistake.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
The most important thing

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
is the direct costs and costs

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
that our company is incurring.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
The selection of employees is the most accurate

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
if we evaluate them by competence.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
There are two main methods

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
that we use.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
The first is the interview by competence.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The second is the evaluation centers.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The advantage of the interview by competence

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
is that our questions will be based

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
on the analysis of the work

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and will be aimed at the development of the skills

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that are required for the work

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
that our candidate is applying for.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The next advantage is that the information

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
received during the interview

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
will be easier to structure

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
and we will easily assign the level of development

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
that the employee demonstrates,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
the information that we will gather

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
during the interview,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
and the skills that are required for the job.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Unfortunately, there are disadvantages.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
The first one is the long duration of the interview.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
In this case, it is important to use

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
the tool that we talked about today,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
which is the tool of a pair comparison.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Before preparing for the interview,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
we will determine the critical competencies

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
together with the manager.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
What is the priority?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
What competencies should be there?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
In the absence of these competencies,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
we can close our eyes and understand

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
that we are simply training this person.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
The manager says that he does not need

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
to know the product,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
he just needs to sell it well.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
This competence is more important.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The other says that he needs to know the product

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
because it is a specific product,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and he will learn to sell it.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Different situations, different managers,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
and in some similar competencies,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
the two cases will be completely different.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
We talked about the matrix of assessment,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
the matrix of developing actions.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
We also need to have a matrix of questions,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
which we will use to identify

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
the competencies that we need.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The difficulty is that the candidate

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
can exaggerate a little.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Perhaps he will not tell what he did himself,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
but he will show how someone did it,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
as if it were his own project.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Therefore, we must initially prepare,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
come up with those questions,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
formulate those small tasks,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
and the answers to which will allow us to determine

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
whether the candidate is talking about what he knows,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
or he is trying to improvise,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
because he has never done this before.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
We can formulate questions aimed at identifying

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
professional competencies.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
For example, we will ask the sales manager

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
to give as many solutions as possible

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
for the situation when the client requires a discount

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
that he cannot give.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Regardless of the product,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
regardless of the specificity of the company's activities,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
either a person knows how to do it,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
or he has never worked before,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and his boss has always solved

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
such difficult situations with the client.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It is more difficult to talk about management competencies

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and corporate competencies.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
That is why it is necessary to ask situational questions,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
to offer different situations,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
to reveal how a person would behave in this situation,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and how he behaved when these situations happened

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
during his previous work.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Thus, by listening to the answers of the candidate during the interview,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
we get a set of positive and negative indicators

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
applicable to the competencies

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
that we analyze.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
This will allow us to analyze

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
the notes that we have left

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and make a preliminary conclusion

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
about the competencies

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
that the candidate has developed.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
For example, by evaluating the competence

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
of the orientation to the result,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
we can ask the candidate questions

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
about what professional goals he sets for himself for the next year,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
how ambitious these goals are for him,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
what difficulties he can foresee in achieving these goals,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
and what can prevent him from fulfilling his plans.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Thus, by listening to his answers and reflection,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
we get a set of positive indicators.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
We can say that this person sets goals for himself,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
that he plans his career for the long term.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
These goals may be professional goals,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
or they may be personal goals.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Or we get a set of negative indicators.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
When we say that we understand that

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
it is clear from the examples that

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
a person does not have specific goals,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
or that he does not know how to set them,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
setting certain goals for his own desire,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
his own expectations.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Thus, in the end, we get some information for analysis.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
When we analyze either a list of negative indicators

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
or a list of positive indicators,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
we understand and can evaluate

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
what level of competence development,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
the level of competence that we analyzed,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
the orientation to the result of this candidate.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Then we compare it to the position.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
How critical is it?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
How much does a person in this position

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
need to be oriented to the result?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
After that, we understand whether this competence

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
was named as a priority.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Thus, we get a tool for comparing

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
completely different candidates.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Colleagues, to conclude the topic of the application

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
of competence models, I will repeat once again

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
that, of course, the most profitable are those companies

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
where the competence model is the core

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
in the system of staff management

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
and all functions are tied, integrated

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
between them. Thus, the company

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
has the opportunity to become more flexible,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
more mobile and better respond to changes

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
because, once again, if we re-examine

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
the competence after some time,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
we guarantee that all our HR policies

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
will be adapted to the changes

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
that occur if the competence

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
is a key tool.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Very often we hear that

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
there is a competence, but it does not work.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
When you start to think why it does not work,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
the reasons are, most likely,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
the resistance of the management

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
and the fact that employees

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
find reasons to ignore the competence.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Why does it happen?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
There may be a number of reasons

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
why the competence does not work.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Let's think about it.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
The first reason is the unreasonable

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
reasons for their development and implementation.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
When the company developed the competence

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
not because it is necessary,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
but because it is the future tool of staff management.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Maybe because everyone does it.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I heard at the conference that

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
the competing company has the competence.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Why not make it ourselves?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
They have the competence.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It is clear that there are no reasons.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
The second reason is that

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
some mistakes were made during the development.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Maybe the model is too complex?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Maybe we tried to describe

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
all the standards of behavior

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
and we got 20 competencies?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Maybe it is too simple?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
There are only 4 of them

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
and employees do not understand

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
how their competence affects their work.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
There is a competence. What is it?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I say, colleagues,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
there can be 4 competencies

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
if we only define the corporate or management.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Then it should be brought to the employees

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
in the right way.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Maybe the model is poorly adapted for business tasks

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and it does not meet the goals of the company?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Maybe it is borrowed from another company?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Or maybe the competence is wrong?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
When we talked about the behavior standards

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
that we describe,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
we talked about the high efficiency of the employees.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
The next one.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
There could be mistakes during the implementation.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The most common mistake is

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
that the employees do not understand

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
the purpose of the competencies.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
But there are some.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
The staff evaluated it,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
but it is not always the case.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Maybe the management does not consider

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
them important.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
It means that there was no proper attention

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
to involve the managers in the process.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It is important that the managers feel like their own.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
If they cannot participate in all stages,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
it is important to gather the managers,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
to introduce them,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
to answer their questions,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
to listen to their comments.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
To make changes, to talk again.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
So that the managers understand

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
that they are also involved.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
The size of the participation will remain behind the scenes.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Maybe the competencies are not integrated

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
into other management systems.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
What does it mean?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
We developed the competencies,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
we evaluate them,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
but it is not easy to develop the profiles,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
develop the questions,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
develop the exercises and use them during selection.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Maybe we did not have time,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
or we did not consider them important,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
or we did not train the people who do the selection.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
There are many reasons.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Once again, both at the development stage and at the implementation stage.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
The next reason why the model of competencies

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
is important is that its development

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
took place during a difficult time for the company.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
What do we mean by a difficult time?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
It can be restructuring,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
it can be a period when the company experienced financial difficulties.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
There may be another aspect,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
there are no financial difficulties,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
but there are many significant changes in the company.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Maybe the shareholder composition changes,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
or some other projects are happening.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
This project is lost

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and it does not get the attention it deserves.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
What are the reasons for the failure of the competencies?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
The next reason why competencies may not work

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
is that they are misused.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
What are the reasons for the failure of the competencies?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
We are talking about the cases

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
when competencies are used as a strict list

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
according to which a person is evaluated.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
There is no flexibility in their application, which is unacceptable.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
There are also cases when the behavior indicators

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
of certain companies are replaced

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
by the personal interpretation of the supervisor of the evaluated employees.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
When he puts into the competencies the meaning

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
that is understandable to him, that is close to him,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
it is not always the meaning that corresponds to the definition

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
that was proposed by the group of developers.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Therefore, it is also important to monitor this point

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and to control, to keep an eye on the pulse,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
to train supervisors,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
to talk to them,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
to help them in the application of this model.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
What else should we pay attention to when working with competencies?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
First, competencies can intersect.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
To check whether competencies intersect,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
it is necessary to determine for yourself,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
to assume,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
whether two employees can work in a company,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
one of which has one of the competencies

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
at a high level of development,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and the other is absent, and vice versa.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
If we can answer the question,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
yes, this is possible, then competencies do not intersect.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
If we can answer the question, yes, this is possible, then competencies do not intersect.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Then there are two ways.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Either we give up one of the competencies,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
or we somehow include one in the other.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Next, competencies can be very confusing.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
When we try to determine

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
the maximum number of behavioral indicators for them,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
and thus the competency becomes

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
simply incomprehensible to the perception.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Next, it is contradictory competencies.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
When competencies contain statements

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
that contradict each other.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
For example, describing the leaders and how the leader makes decisions,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
there may be a behavioral indicator,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
for example, such that the leader

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
makes decisions himself and takes responsibility.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And then there is a little bit less talk about

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
that when making a decision, he consults with colleagues

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
or, for example, with subordinates.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It is clear that these are things that are a little contradictory,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
and therefore competencies need to be calculated and analyzed

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
so that this does not happen, then it will be difficult to apply them.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
The next point is when competencies

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
incorrectly define standards.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And the mistake is that competencies are not divided by levels.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And thus, qualified and unqualified performers,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
that is, people who have and do not have competencies,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
they receive the same rating.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
This is, again, a question of formulation.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Therefore, at the stage of formulating the list,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
these questions should be asked.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The next point is when competencies in their definition

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
as indicators contain not actions, but results.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Colleagues, once again, competencies are those characteristics of a person

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
that we in the company can measure at the behavioral level.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Thus, in determining competencies,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
we should always answer the question of what a person does,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
but in no case should we describe some goals and results

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
that a person with this competence should achieve.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
We can say that the model of competence is successfully implemented.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
When can we say that the model of competence is successfully implemented?

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
First of all, it is necessary to understand

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
that the model of competence is not a model of competence.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
It is a model of competence that is implemented

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
in a way that is not a model of competence.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
First of all, it is implemented when it is constantly being improved.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
When employees discuss competencies that are necessary for their work.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
That is, competencies themselves are part of professional slang.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And employees operate them.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
If you hear when one employee says to another,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
but now you have not shown competence in your team,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
it means that competencies have entered your corporate slang.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
It has become the language you started to speak.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
This is one of the reasons why you are not able to work in a team.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And, of course, we can talk about success when our managers

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
or sub-units of the middle-high-ranking branch

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
perceive competence as a tool of staff management

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
that helps them in their daily work.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
To summarize, we will formulate several recommendations

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
about what is needed for competence to work.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Colleagues, first of all, an objective reason for the creation

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and implementation of the competence model is needed.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
It is necessary to understand that the competence model

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
is a very important reason for the creation and implementation of the competence model.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Second, it is necessary to involve line managers and employees

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
at all stages of work.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
It is necessary to organize a competent internal PR project.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
That is, to inform about how and why it happens,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
what benefit the company, the line manager,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and the employees get.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
It is necessary to teach how to use competencies

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
when they are developed.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It is necessary to repeat the general practice of using competencies.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
That is, when evaluating the developed competence for the first time,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
it is necessary to be flexible and test again

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
whether the competencies you have formulated

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
are really the standards,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
the priority standards of behavior

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
that are necessary for your company.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And the last one is a mandatory,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
let's say, gradual integration of competence

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
into all policies and procedures of the staff management service.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Colleagues, I wish you success and patience

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
in implementing this project in your companies

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
and I believe that the time we spent together was useful.
