WEBVTT

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.870
Good morning, dear listeners.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.290
My name is Natalya Ivanovna Dmitrieva.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.750
I present you the course

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.450
of international economic relations.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.210
The topics we will consider

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.790
today are the world economy, international

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.010
economic relations, balance

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.750
in the international

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.070
economy, modern development

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.230
of international economic

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.650
relations, state

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.490
regulation of foreign

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.550
trade.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.690
The final theme of our discussion

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.250
will be the international financial

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.010
system and currency regulation.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.270
The first question I would like to

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.770
address is the position of the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.210
subject of international economic

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.950
relations in the system of scientific

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.850
knowledge.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.990
There are currently two

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.670
positions, two approaches

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.890
to this issue.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.830
One group of authors believes that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.970
international economic relations

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.850
are fully included in the course

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.390
of international economy.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.890
Another group of authors believes that

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.310
this is an independent course that

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.270
considers more specific economic

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.990
relationships.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.530
Please look at the scheme.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.030
In principle, micro- and

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.470
macroeconomics, as general

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.570
theoretical sciences, are the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.330
basis of all scientific knowledge

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.710
related to international

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.470
economic relations.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.430
International economics,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.710
as a subject, is part of economic

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.410
theory and includes both

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.490
international economic relations

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.550
and the characteristics

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.550
of the world economy.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270
In the process of developing scientific

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.150
knowledge, international

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.510
economic relations as

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.490
a subject have become more

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.450
independent and have become

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.070
more independent.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.670
This course deals with more

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.650
specific economic relations.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.230
And the international economy

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.950
is closely related to the following

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.310
course of foreign

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.490
economic activity of the FIR.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.810
On the other hand, such a course as

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.390
world economy considers the problems

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.010
of different regions and is quite

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.530
closely related to the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.810
subject of economic geography.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.770
The object of the world economy

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.930
is the world economy as a whole.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.430
But as for the subject, we will pay

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.230
attention first of all to the development

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.410
of international economic

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.290
relations and their

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.670
modern forms.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.230
The subject of international

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.510
economic relations are firms, individuals,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.270
non-profit organizations,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.610
national economies in the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.730
person of the state, regional

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.450
systems in the person of regional-

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.410
state institutions and even

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.590
international economic

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.450
organizations.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.330
The new subjects, of course,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.570
are non-profit organizations

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.770
and international economic

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.210
organizations, which have been

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.890
actively involved in the process

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.270
of regulating international

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.270
economic relations.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.950
The world economy can be

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.890
defined as a set of national

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.370
economies.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.650
It is a combination, because

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.190
it is assumed that there are

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.170
quite close relationships between them.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.170
And such a set of countries has a greater

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.670
impact on the development of the world

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.470
economy as a whole than the simple

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.670
sum of countries.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.490
The development of the world economy

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.010
is linked to a number of major factors.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.250
First of all, the first such

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.750
factor affecting the development

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.610
of the world economy is the uneven

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.410
distribution of production

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.810
factors on the territory

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.870
of the land.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.530
This was once addressed by Adam Smith,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.130
and then by David Ricardo.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.410
They proved that the cause of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.630
international exchange is the difference

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.030
in labor productivity in individual

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.190
countries.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.170
In turn, this productivity

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.950
of labour is based on the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.590
fact that countries have

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.410
different factors of production.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.050
The next factor that influences the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.950
development of the world economy is

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.630
the movement of production factors.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.550
In economic theory, it is called

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.610
the term of the mobility of

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.990
production factors.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.050
All these processes – the movement of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.770
factors of production, the presence

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.250
of factors of production in some countries

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.050
– contribute to the development

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.550
of international division of labour

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.210
and the international division of

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.730
factors of production.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.870
First of all, in the

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.310
course of economic theory, you once

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.690
understood such factors

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.270
of production as labor, land,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.690
capital, entrepreneurial capacity.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.790
In the present day,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.750
these factors are developing.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.030
And, in principle, if you start

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.210
listing those factors

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.550
of production, which are associated

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.750
with a sufficiently large list.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.870
Based on this, modern statistics, in

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.810
particular the International

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.330
Statistical Commission of the United

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.330
Nations, has proposed to divide the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.370
factors into primary and secondary.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.370
Of course, the primary factors

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.970
will remain labor, land,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.210
capital and entrepreneurial capacity.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.190
But the secondary factors that

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.950
are developing right now are

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.510
information, technology and

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.030
even government regulation.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.930
I draw your attention to the fact

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.390
that work in this case is

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.650
any physical or mental activity

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.470
of people.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.230
The earth is natural resources,

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.390
minerals, water, forests, air,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.610
subsoil.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.910
Capital is, first of all, the accumulated

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.590
stock of production factors,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.930
such as machinery, equipment,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.310
raw materials, materials.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.510
In this case, special attention should

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.530
be paid to such a factor of

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.030
production as technology.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.490
It is often considered as a component

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.750
factor of capital production.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.670
Depending on the presence or endowment

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.890
of factors of production,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.090
countries develop their specialization,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.150
organize production

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.710
activities in their economic

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.710
territories.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.650
Please look at the slide.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.850
By the origin of the factor

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.350
of production could still be divided

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.130
into the main and developed.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.390
These are the most natural

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.970
factors developed and acquired.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.330
This division of factors has allowed

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.810
a number of economists to develop

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.990
the concept of international

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.210
competitiveness of nations,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.830
which proves that the presence

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.450
of not only natural, but also

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.370
the development of acquired

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.410
factors leads to a faster development

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.450
of the national economy.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.550
Let’s say Japan.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.850
It does not have a large set of

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.430
basic natural factors, but is

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.730
the leading country in international

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.190
economic relations precisely

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.510
because of the fact that it acquires

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.290
and develops other factors

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.830
of production around the world.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.170
According to the degree of specialization, the

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.710
factors of production are divided into general specific factors.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.390
Common factors are used in any

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.890
field of production

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.550
and are assumed to have

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.150
a fairly high mobility.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.930
Such factors of production could

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.930
be attributed, for example, to

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.630
laborers, who in any sphere

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.870
of the economy engage in the

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.170
same type of activity.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.110
Specific factors are less

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.990
mobile, and often not mobile

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.670
at all, because they involve some

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.810
special knowledge, special

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.850
methods of economic activity.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.730
In the international economy, this

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.510
division into general specific factors

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.670
is due to the fact that the income

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.450
of the owners of specific

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.810
and general factors is different.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.630
If, for example, export-oriented

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.890
sectors of the economy are developing,

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.870
and in these sectors of the

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.570
economy people are beginning to

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.350
earn higher incomes, then,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.570
of course, the owners of

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.670
specific factors, namely, for example,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.130
those very oil wells, will

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.110
receive much greater incomes

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.270
than the owners of common factors,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.810
namely engineers, namely, who

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.810
do not possess any special

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.970
qualification, and the same

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.110
cleaners or programmers, which

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.490
can be used in completely different

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.530
fields of economic activity.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.390
Thus, the development of these groups

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.710
of factors leads to the development

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.590
of international division of labour,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.450
that is, a stable concentration

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.190
of production of certain types

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.990
of products in certain countries.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.890
The international division of labour

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.650
presupposes the existence of its second

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.870
half of the development of the international

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.150
cooperative of production, but

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.870
the international cooperative of

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.450
production does not necessarily

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.210
develop as a result of the development

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.330
of the international division of labour.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.710
What does it have to do with?

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.650
Suppose a less developed country,

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.650
and it specializes in producing

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.030
and even harvesting local

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.650
fruits.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.710
Then, in principle, cooperation

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.210
in fruit production,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.010
in general, is not needed.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.530
It is engaged in this production

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.270
for its own consumption, and it

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.510
is unlikely that these fruits

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.690
can be exported at all.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.670
The process of cooperation

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.290
still implies a high level of

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.250
development of industrial production

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.550
and begins to develop

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.250
only when as a result of this

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.610
cooperation the companies

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.250
acquire some technological advantages.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.410
An example of such international

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.190
cooperation is, suppose, the development

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.290
of the finished

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.670
clothing industry.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.990
Look, our domestic manufacturers

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.510
no longer produce in our factories

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.590
and factory, do not sew clothes

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.570
in Russia.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.270
The technology of the model is being

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.270
developed in Russia, production

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.930
is organized in China as a cheaper

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.010
option, but it is already

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.770
spread, is being implemented

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.210
again in Russia.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.310
Thus, international cooperation,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.870
I repeat, helps to save

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.430
the very limited resources

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.870
that are in society

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.630
and to organize production

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.090
effectively.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.100
If we pay attention to the scheme of the

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.820
relationship between the types of division

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.520
of labor, this scheme reflects the processes

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.120
of development of the international

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.020
division of labor.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.100
Initially, international division

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.620
of labor developed as a national

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.340
or regional division of labor,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.800
and over time firms began to

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.500
specialize in the production

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.920
of goods for export, and thus

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.640
formed an international

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.300
division of labor.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.420
What is the characteristic of the modern

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.520
international division of labor?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.940
It is presented in the world in such

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.640
forms as general, private, individual.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.500
What is meant here?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.640
On the one hand, the international

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.260
division of labor can be common in

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.360
large spheres of production, private

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.960
- specialization in industries

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.200
and sub-branches, and

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.800
single - internal.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.540
Special attention is paid to the

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.000
development of single internal

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.420
division of labor, because international

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.880
and transnational corporations

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.980
organize the production

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.200
process so that the entire production

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.380
cycle is not organized in one

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.940
country, but distributed in

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.900
a number of countries depending

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.020
on where the factors of

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.520
production are cheaper.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.400
And thus the modern international

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.400
division of labour at the level

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.880
of the individual can

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.060
be presented in such forms as in

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.060
detail and operational.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.400
Imagine that technology is being developed

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.380
to produce the same finished clothes

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.200
in the United States, and

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.500
in neighboring countries, border areas,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.240
for example, clothing is being

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.420
uncovered, and in another country,

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.960
the sewing of sleeves and pockets

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.840
or buttons can be made.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.720
Thus, companies identify the

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.040
most rational solutions to

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.360
these problems.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.340
Thus, if you look again at the scheme

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.260
on the development of international division

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.840
of labor, the process of international

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.360
specialization goes in such a way

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.380
that the countries are initially

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.040
specialized in the flood

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:22.520
variant of division of labor.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.340
And immersion specialization

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.080
involves the creation of finished

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.840
products, a fully completed production

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.000
cycle on the territory

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.140
of one country.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.220
According to detailed division of

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.280
labor, it just implies the

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.500
export of components and assembly in

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.040
some regions of the

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.000
world, where the production

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.560
process is cheaper, and even

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.680
operational.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.180
In particular, the option on

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.200
the operational division of labor will

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.200
be given an example.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.940
There would be an organization of

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:04.580
such operations as the organization

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.000
of management and marketing in one of the

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.500
countries.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.660
Now, the issue of international

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.620
cooperation.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.480
It can develop only when

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.580
such processes as the coordination

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.180
of business activities

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.240
of partners from different

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.420
countries develop.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.820
Rhythm is expected in the organization

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.220
of their activities.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.740
In modern conditions, the achievement

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.440
of international management is

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.660
the development of JIT systems, exactly

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.680
on time or just in time, which implies

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.720
that the communication between the

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.740
firms is at such a high level that

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.520
the delivery of components

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:57.700
is done on time in the interval

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.300
of up to 15 -20 minutes.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.180
Of course, such an organization

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.700
of the production process is primarily

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.320
characteristic of highly developed,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.400
technologically equipped firms.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.150
The main forms of cooperative relations

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.190
existing today in the world.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.850
This is primarily contractual

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.910
cooperation, related to the supply

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.410
of raw materials, components.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.650
of joint production.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.790
In this case, it is a higher level

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.270
of development of international

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.390
cooperation and involves the development

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.450
of programs that combine

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.850
both resources and responsibilities

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.410
between partners.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.910
And contractual specialization,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.450
which implies the development

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.270
of such ties between competing companies

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.690
that they agree not to engage in the

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.190
development and production

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.210
of the same types of products,

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.930
but, on the contrary,

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.370
to organize joint production

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.010
that would provide the

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.750
needs of both competing

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.130
companies.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:12.340
The most developed form

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.600
of cooperation in the modern

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.560
world is integrated cooperation.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.200
In this case, it is assumed that

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.140
the companies are implementing

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.060
modern logistics techniques,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.620
and the organization of the production

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.940
process, trade, transportation

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.760
are based on computer technologies,

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.200
and the processes

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.900
are tracked in real time.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.220
This integrated approach is of

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.600
course the most significant

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.460
effect when using the most limited

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.360
factors of production.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.570
The stages of development of international

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.110
economic relations are connected

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.770
with these three essential components.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.430
First of all, it is the formation of

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.730
the global market.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.070
The next step is the formation

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.290
of the global economy.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.750
The last stage is related to the

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.230
formation of the international economy.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.170
Please look at the scheme.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.390
Evolution is the form of the market.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.850
If we present three countries

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.910
that are connected by substantial

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.470
international economic

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.930
relations, then, as you

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.410
can see, each individual

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.470
circle represents

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.170
a national market.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.890
At the top of the chart is shown the

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.590
market segment that is related to the

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.550
domestic market.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.470
That is, in this case it

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.630
is assumed that the producers meet

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.310
the needs of domestic demand

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.470
and do not produce goods for

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.110
international relations, for

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.770
international sales.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.890
The international market just

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.650
implies the development of such

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.950
a special segment of the market,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.970
part of the national economy, which

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.150
will be directly connected with

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.370
foreign markets.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.670
In general, all three countries are

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.290
included in the world market, i.e. in

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.510
the sphere of sustainable commodity-

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.710
monetary relations between countries

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.250
based on international division

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.630
of labor.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.770
The development of the world market, the

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.870
world economy, has been quite violent

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:49.090
in different periods of time of history.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.130
The formation of the world market dates

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.290
back to the 16th century.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.990
The era of great geographical discoveries

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.170
helped develop international trade

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.390
relations, and the formation of the world

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.890
market in that period contributed to

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.830
the development of market economies

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.590
of the countries of the world.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.930
The formation of the world market

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.530
ended, as economists believe,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.470
somewhere by the end of the XIX - early

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.870
XX century.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.010
At the beginning of the 20th century,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.190
the world economy began to form.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.310
The main criteria for the formation

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.090
of the world economy are the emergence

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.870
of not only international trade

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.050
as a form of international economic

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.810
relations, but also the appearance

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.570
of the movement of factors

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.330
of production between countries

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.750
and the appearance of activities

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.330
of such new economic

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.850
entities as transnational

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.110
corporations.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.110
The formation of the international

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.930
economy, as I said, is taking

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.390
place at the present stage, and

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.650
we will consider the features

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.890
associated with this

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.910
stage of development.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.730
Let’s see how the international

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.650
trade in Russia has developed.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.250


00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.670
In general, in ancient Russia, the

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.230
emergence of stable international trade relations

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.930
can be attributed to the 11th and 12th

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.710
centuries, although some trade relations

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.790
also develop in the 8th and 9th centuries.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.430
And if you look at the structure

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.370
of the ancient Russian cities,

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.030
the center of each city was just a marketplace,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.750
and a special layer of people,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.870
intermediaries, those merchants

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.190
were formed.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.630
The ancient definition of the class

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.850
of mediators is quite interesting.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.550
The prosol is an intermediary pharmacist.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.590
Accordingly, he organized the

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.430
production process in such a way

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.250
that he bought salt, honey,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.570
wax, concentrated them

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.770
in some warehouses, and then

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.910
sold them to a smaller

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.550
economic intermediary.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.570
Athens is just that small intermediary,

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.490
a carabinier, who wandered

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.050
through different cities and

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.310
cities, and sold small goods

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.010
of final consumption.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.570
The buyer is an intermediary already

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.170
between the producer and the consumer,

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.710
and in this case he can also make

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.850
transactions between producers

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.050
if he trades raw materials.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.450
A visitor is a merchant who trades with other countries.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.890
Thus, we see that already in

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.690
ancient Russia, quite high rates.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.020
The main features of the global market.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.790
First of all, it has such important

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.630
functions.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.010
First, it performs a sanitary function.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.910
In the international competition

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.110
of firms that are unable

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.270
to redistribute available

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.570
limited resources more efficiently,

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.490
the user is more efficiently

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.090
eventually ruined.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.310
It has an information function.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.930
It is in the global market that price formation occurs.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.910
And the world prices are revealed,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.730
which the national producer

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.190
begins to focus on.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.750
It should also be noted that the

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.470
world market is influenced not only

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.930
by domestic demand, but also by external.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.870
It takes account of external demand.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.330
After all, we have found out that

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.550
part of the economy of a number

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.110
of countries is directly oriented

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.470
only to export or import.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.950
The main markets that exist

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.830
in the world are exports

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.030
and imports.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.070
Exports are the exports of goods from the country.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.290
It is important to note how

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.910
the exports are estimated.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.970
The value of the export is calculated under

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.590
the so-called FUP price, or the franco-border

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.870
of the country of the exporter.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.870
That is, it is assumed that the price

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.430
of the export goods includes all the

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.250
costs of its production and transportation

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.390
to the franco-border of

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.350
the country of the exporter.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.230
As for imports, which involve exports

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.430
of goods from the country, it is

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.070
calculated under the price

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.290
of the SIF, that is, the franco-border

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.050
of the country of the importer.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.810
Thus, international transportation

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.510
by oceans, by air transport routes,

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.110
these costs are included in the

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.790
price of imported goods.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.530
That is, only at the time

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.790
of crossing the national

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.530
economic border are fully counted

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.590
those costs that were associated

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.970
with the production

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.030
and transportation of imports.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.350
I would also like to draw your attention

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.610
to the fact that the volume of exports

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.390
includes not only goods that are

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.970
taken out of the country, but

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.650
also goods for re-export.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.910
What does this mean?

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.710
When international exhibitions

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.650
are organized, the samples

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.250
presented at these exhibitions

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.910
willingly cross the border,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.030
for a while are in the so-

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.050
called country of

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.850
the importer, and then return.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:04.090
This volume of re-export is also included

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.470
in the volume of exports.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.950
In general, in the case of international

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.610
division of labor and international

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.730
cooperation, if, for example,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.410
a foreign firm carried a goods

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.870
into our country, which is

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.150
then subjected to substantial

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.710
processing, then after

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.810
this processing the goods

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.910
are incorporated into the

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.930
products of domestic

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.350
production.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.290
After such a substantial processing,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.290
it is exported back to foreign

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.390
countries.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.570
It is also a re-export option, but it

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.550
is associated with substantial recycling.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.110
An important question in the characterization

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.330
of international economic relations

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.690
of the world economy is the indicator

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.250
of the development of foreign

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.570
trade of the country.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.210
And the most common indicators

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.950
are the trade turnover balance,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.310
which represents the difference

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.110
between exports and imports, or

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.850
trade balance, as well as foreign

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.330
trade turnover or the amount of

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.810
exports and imports.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.670
Accordingly, if the country's

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.570
exports exceed imports, then

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.770
this is a positive trade balance.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.210
If, on the contrary, imports, which

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.970
in general are less desirable

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.530
than exports, then a negative

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.830
trade balance in a given country.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.290
Ideally, all countries should

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.150
try to balance their international

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.810
trade and a

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.090
balanced trade balance.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.170
The indicator of inclusion of the country

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.610
in the world economy, in the world

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.210
economy, developed by international

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.350
organizations, is the export

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.390
quota, import quota and the index

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.910
of openness.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.410
The export quota shows the share of

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.530
the value of exports in gross

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.910
domestic product, expressed in percentage.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.810
Import quota is the value of imports,

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.470
respectively, attributed

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.310
to the value of GDP and also

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.650
expressed in percentage.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.510
An interesting index of transparency.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.550
It shows the value of foreign

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.990
trade turnover in relation

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.270
to gross domestic product.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.650
If we take developed and

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.270
developing economies, how to

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.630
characterize how much the country

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.070
is included in the world

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.150
economy, international

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.530
economic relations.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.370
As practice shows, the high index of

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.330
openness is characteristic of mainly

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:45.270
small countries, with a small volume

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.190
of foreign trade, with a small territory,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.810
a fairly small population,

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.810
and so on.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.030
But large countries, despite the fact

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.230
that they are quite strongly included

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.330
in export-import relations, their

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.750
external economic turnover

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.590
does not occupy such a significant

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.270
share of GDP.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.530
If you take the US, it is

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.610
about export-import quotas

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.170
and the open index is approaching

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.810
20%.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.750
Russia is at the same level.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.730
On the other hand, if you take

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.270
some small countries of

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.530
the European Union, they may

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.950
have an open index that exceeds 100%.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.530
If we take the economies that are

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.090
located in the territory of

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.690
the transit routes and through

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.770
them transit, then these economies

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.510
will have an index of openness

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.310
of inclusion in the world economy,

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.810
especially on the export quota,

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:47.870
reaching about 150-170%.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:53.930
What are the characteristics of the development

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.670
of the world economy, the world

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.850
economy and the international economy?

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.430
Pay attention to the scheme.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.990
As I said before, the first stage of the

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.710
development of the world market is the XVI-XIX

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.930
century.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.950
Accordingly, by the end of the XIX

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.610
- early XX century, stable

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.050
foreign economic relations, stable

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.850
exchange of goods and services

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.470
between the leading countries were established.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.490
The second stage is the world

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.650
economy, again the boundary of the XIX -

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.010
early XX century.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.930
And the main feature, the main difference,

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.070
is that the international trade

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.950
has been added by a stable exchange

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.970
of mobile factors of production,

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.490
namely, the exchange of labour,

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.590
the exchange of capital.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.830
International forms of production have

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.870
emerged in the territory of different

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.310
countries of the world.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:30:00.550
In this case, the use of international

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.710
cooperation of production and

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.950
the distribution of individual

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.230
links of the technological process

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.790
between countries is assumed.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:18.330
Design in one country, assembly

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.750
of component production in some

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.270
second, third countries, but final

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.410
packaging and sale in another

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.150
country.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.470
At this same time, special forms

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.710
of international economic

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.130
agents appear.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.410
These are transnational corporations.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:44.290
International monopolies, according to the

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.630
approach of international organizations,

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.950
are divided into transnational corporations

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.010
and inter-national corporations.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.010
Transnational corporations assume

00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:02.030
that the origin of capital relates

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.570
to one country, and in principle it

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.090
can be transnational corporations

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.890
in the United States, or there,

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:10.390
transnational corporations

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.690
in Germany.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.130
Usually, the headquarters of

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.590
such transnational corporations

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.150
are located in the country

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.370
whose flag is assigned to the company.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.210
Why do transnational

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.150
corporations, while using

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.250
capital from around the world,

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.070
as they are usually shareholders,

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.590
still stick to

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.070
one or another national

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.050
economy as such?

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.670
This is due to the fact that usually

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.690
states are interested in the development

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.270
of their transnational corporations,

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.410
because they receive from them quite

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.930
significant tax revenues, plus

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.650
transnational corporations spread

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.430
around the world within the

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.890
framework of globalization just

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.070
the ideas of the value of that

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.250
country, that capital, which

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.350
are connected with the

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.510
origin in one country or another.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.350
The next stage is the second half of

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.610
the 20th century, the third stage is the

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.370
development of the international economy.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.190
What is the difference between the

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.190
international economy and the previous

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.750
stages of the world market?

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:24.850
The modern international economy,

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.610
of course, includes the development of

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.170
the world market and the development

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.350
of all features of the world economy.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.430
But here there are specific new,

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.070
so to speak, unique features.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.430
Modern computerization of production,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.350
and not only of production,

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.970
but also of services, has

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.150
allowed the development of international

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.830
financial relations to such a

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.110
level that modern international

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.790
finance has become such a separate

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.610
part of international economic

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.970
relations.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.790
And the same Internet finance,

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.490
international trading, international

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.330
exchanges, Internet exchanges are

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.090
just an independent sphere in the development

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.210
of international economic

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.670
relations.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.590
This is a special feature of

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.310
the third stage of the development

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.030
of the international economy.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.850
The next characteristic of

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:24.650
the modern stage is the presence

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.930
of sufficiently developed

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.190
state regulation of international

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.610
economic relations on the

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.770
basis of the development of

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.090
modern supra-state institutions,

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.250
various international

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.250
organizations.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:45.950
An example is the development of an

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.210
international financial institution

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.210
as the World Bank, as the International

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.950
Monetary Fund.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.350
It is assumed that on the basis

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.590
of the activities of such

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.950
institutions there

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.150
is mutual regulation, conflict,

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.930
and the removal of disputed

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.910
issues that help develop

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.010
modern international

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.990
economic relations.

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:19.590
The next topic that is

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.770
proposed to your consideration

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.350
is the balance of the international

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.590
economy.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.510
In principle, the situation of balance

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.710
in economic theory was considered

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.530
with us at the level of either one

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.130
market, one product market, or within

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.830
the framework of macroeconomics.

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.830
And then the ideal situation was assumed

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.990
when the demand is equal to the supply

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.370
for some type of products or

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.070
on the territory of the national

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.890
economy, the total demand of the

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.190
country is equal to the total supply.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.790
It was assumed that at this point there

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.130
was no overproduction, but not before

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.230
the production of goods.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.450
Both consumers and producers

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.490
are fully satisfied, and the

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.050
level of prices that have developed

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.390
in the product or

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.130
territorial domestic market.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.530
How is the balance and the simplest

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.510
price scheme in the world

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.610
market?

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.270
In this case, when we consider

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.550
the various forms of international

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.830
economic relations, we say that

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.570
one of the reasons, for example, for

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.530
exports, is the creation of excess

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.390
commodity mass on the territory

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.750
of the country.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.630
The market then performs some

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.210
such stabilizing functions.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.910
We throw onto the world market those goods

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.290
that are not used, or rather, we

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.830
say, are not needed in such a quantity

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.050
on the territory of a given

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.190
country, although they are in demand.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.310
On the other hand, imports.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.790
Imports open up a normal product deficit.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.290
The international market performs

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.430
such, again, stabilizing functions.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.690
If the domestic producers do not

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.810
agree to produce at such prices,

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.610
and the consumer still needs these

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.610
goods, we will import them.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:08.930
How then?

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.290
In this case, you and I must understand

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.970
that this is a conditional scheme

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.750
of such momentary balance as the

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.410
photo, which is being made in the

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.310
world market.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.050
In real reality, the world

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.210
market is never imagined

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.850
as a picture, and real prices

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.350
are constantly deviating

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.010
in one direction or another

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.750
from some average.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:33.430
But the mechanism of formation of

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.970
these prices we can understand with

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.730
you by the scheme that we present

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.650
on the slide, which shows how the

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.710
trends of setting world prices

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:49.770
and informal theoretical balance

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.250
in the world market will

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.210
survive.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.730
If you imagine two countries, country

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.770
1 and country 2, and imagine that

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.150
they are initially completely

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.950
closed countries, that is, they

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.990
have absolutely no international

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.210
trade, then, accordingly,

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.510
on the domestic market,

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.130
according to this model,

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.430
they have an internal

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.850
balance.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.950
That is, demand is fully

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.730
satisfied by supply at this

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.630
price level.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.210
But we can imagine that the price

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.490
level, for example, in country 1, for

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.870
this type of goods is P1, as you

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.530
can see, this price is relatively

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.170
lower than that price that

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.850
is set in country 2.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:43.810
There the balance price is higher

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.830
than P1 and reaches some level

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.010
higher because it seems that

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.250
in this country the costs

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.510
are higher.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.690
Ultimately, if our borders

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.310
are opened, not closed by any

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.130
prohibitions by the state, customs

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.650
and other barriers, then our

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.470
domestic producer from the

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.170
country 1, having goods at

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.190
a cheaper price, can not even

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.890
take into account the demand

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.470
of national consumers, and

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.870
quickly transports this goods

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.970
to the country 2, to

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.990
pay more.

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:22.030
At least, there the price will be higher

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.590
than the price that will be in the country

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.590
1.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.970
On the other hand, a country

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.150
2 that has such high prices will

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.050
be happy for its consumers

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.950
to buy a product at a level price

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.830
lower than its national price.

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:43.710
Based on this, such inter-country

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.030
mutual interests of consumers and

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.650
sellers in different countries lead

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.550
to the fact that trade exchange

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.230
is designated.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.190
I do not consider in this

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.350
simple scheme the reasons, other

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.670
reasons, for which international

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.290
economic relations are

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.670
established.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.910
Well, it is enough to say that such

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.750
low prices in the country were

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.390
just because of the fact that there

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.470
is an excess of some factors of production,

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.170
and therefore they have a

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.350
relatively cheap production.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.350
That is why they, so to speak, agree

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.750
to produce and provide

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.170
their goods not only to the national

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.690
economy, but to the whole

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.170
world.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.450
But even if, so to speak, these sellers

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.010
have purely such economic

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.930
interests to obtain some greater

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.650
profit than they have in the territory

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.130
of the national economy, even

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.230
such an incentive still leads

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.490
to the fact that international

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.250
exchange is established.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.730
And as a result, we and you

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.490
may consider the various consequences

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.890
of establishing balance, the development

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.030
of international trade, consider

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.430
the losers, the winning

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.310
parties from the world

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.250
market.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:55.930
Now we have another task.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.110
We need to find out how

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.410
the world price is set.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.750
Thus, it is clear that if such

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.230
flows go in the counter-variant,

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.610
then in country 2 there will

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.390
be some other product that will

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.950
be relatively cheaper produced

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.170
than in country 1.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.210
And then, even without a currency exchange,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.630
but simply a simple exchange

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.370
of goods, these countries will quite

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.250
possibly agree to exchange with

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.670
each other these goods.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.230
In modern conditions, of course,

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.630
there is no necessarily natural

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.050
exchange between countries, there are

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.570
currency relations, and therefore payments

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.270
for export and import of goods

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.410
go in currency by agreement

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.590
of the parties.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.770
In this case, the first conclusion

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.270
that we can make here is that the

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.370
price at which international

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.590
trade is carried out is between

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.410
the minimum and maximum

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.630
domestic equilibrium prices

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.010
in the two countries that existed

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.550
this equilibrium before the

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.470
establishment of international

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.290
trade.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.570
Also note, here is the segment A1B1, it

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.590
is the product that, so to speak, will

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.790
come to the international market,

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.610
and it is exactly equal to the segment

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.790
that we have on the chart for the

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.190
country 2, corresponding

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.470
to the segment A2B2.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.210
In this case, export

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.950
flow must be equal

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.110
to import flow.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.030
And when the relationship is already

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.590
established not about just

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.190
one commodity, it is assumed that

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.010
export and import flows are alternately

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.290
balanced.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:43.390
The principle of trade balance.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.560
This is the principle of trade balance,

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.360
I will clarify this, that is, in

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.980
the end, even if we do not include

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:55.280
currency calculations, in this ideal

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.260
balance-based option, the country

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.720
receives some amount of imports

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:00.920
for its exports.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.820
On the other hand, they pay for

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.060
imports with exports.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.960
Based on the principle of trade

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.300
balance, it is a situation

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.480
that if countries for some economic,

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:10.960
political reasons decided

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.460
to limit the flow of

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.160
goods between countries, then

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:17.320
in the long term, the reduction

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.880
of their exports leads

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.560
to a reduction in

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:22.740
imports.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.640
In turn, a reduction in imports

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.700
leads to a reduction in exports.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.980
Because this is the natural

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.580
balance of commodity

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.240
flows, it still exists.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.320
Of course, in the modern

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.400
international economy, when the

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.180
number of counterparts is

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:40.220
large enough, take the WTO members

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.460
of 150 countries, if you trade

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.860
with them all, then, probably,

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.100
in general, this is a multidimensional

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.680
system for

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.540
pricing.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.580
But there are still some leaders

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.340
in product groups and,

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:53.240
accordingly, prices

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.420
are set on the basis of the activities

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.260
of these counterparties,

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.720
for example, on international

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.380
exchanges or on the basis of

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.400
pricing related to the

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:03.240
activities of large

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.880
transnational corporations

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.880
or other major market players.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.400
But what conclusion do we still draw from

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.840
this scheme, which illustrates the establishment

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:15.900
of balance and the establishment

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.540
of the world price?

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.880
Not only in economic theory, but

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.400
also in economic practice, the term

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.460
trade condition has been established,

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:29.180
which means that if we consider

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.500
some trade conditions, we

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.900
must put together the value

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.120
of export and the value

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.000
of import.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.280
In other words, trade conditions

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:40.120
are the relationship to

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.400
export and import prices.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.360
In this case, the country

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:46.480
is interested in improving trade

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.860
conditions, that is, so

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.760
that its export prices hang.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.600
Better to say, not even the export

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.720
prices themselves, but the entire cost of exports.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.180
What would it mean to

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.900
improve the trade conditions?

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.460
If we have export prices rising,

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.160
while we export the same absolute

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.900
volume, then the cost of exports

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.440
as a whole increases.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.160
Then, for this cost of export, we will

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.920
buy more imports.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.440
The relative price of imports will then

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.860
decrease significantly.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.240
At the same time, the real prices of

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.080
imports seem to have not changed,

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.640
but the relative price expressed

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:23.520
in trade conditions is changing.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.580
In this case, the trade condition is

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.640
a more natural indicator, not associated

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.920
with sharp fluctuations in the exchange

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.780
rate, because the trade condition

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.180
can be expressed on the basis

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.620
of such commodity groups,

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.160
so to speak, in currency

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.560
by the peritoneum of purchasing power.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.220
What are the balance functions of the

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:48.300
global market?

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.280
First of all, the size of exports

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:53.500
is determined by the size of the excess

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:54.780
supply of goods.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.860
Maybe not always, but often, so

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.800
to speak, this can be the situation.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.080
Overproduction in the national

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.640
economy market, the world market

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:08.860
does not allow to be achieved,

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.460
purchases excess supply to itself.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.020
But that doesn’t mean that

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.520
there are goods on the domestic market

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:17.900
that no one needs.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.560
And this excess offer suddenly

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.980
went to the world market.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.980
It is assumed that if you remember

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.160
the definition of demand, demand is associated

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.560
not only with the desire to

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.960
buy, but with the solvency of the consumer.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.380
If the consumer’s solvency

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.420
is low and he can’t buy the

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.660
most offered products, then,

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.280
of course, this product

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.200
can be offered to the richer

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.360
in income consumer

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.500
in the world market.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.400
This is the case, for example, with

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.840
developing countries.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.540
For emerging industrialized

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:50.860
economies, China, in terms

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:54.140
of the needs of the Chinese

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:55.560
population, which has a billion

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.460
people there, all China’

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.300
s exports could probably

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.260
be absorbed within

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.220
the national economy.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.300
But in this case, again - again,

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.140
we calculate the

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.800
payability of our consumers.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.680
The size of imports is determined

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.320
by the size of excess demand for goods.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.360
Of course, it is assumed that if

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.840
there is a certain, so to speak,

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:20.540
deficit situation, then the prices

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.160
of the goods will rise, and, accordingly,

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.340
the importer will simply be

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.920
interested in getting this quantity

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:27.880
of goods.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.400
The next principle, which I mentioned

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.240
before, is the principle

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.800
of trade balance.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.160
This does not mean that in real practice

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.380
countries should absolutely precisely

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.980
establish a situation where the

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.700
cost of export is equal to the

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:43.880
cost of import.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.040
But given that the country flows are

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:48.520
diverse, and that we have a large

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.960
number of countries involved in economic

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.480
relations, it is desirable that

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.160
the trade balance of the whole

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.980
group of countries is either

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:59.060
equal or positive.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.720
But at least a negative

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:02.900
trade balance can only

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.760
be tolerated to some level.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.320
Because if this is a long-term

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.340
trend, then, as you know, if

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.100
we buy a lot on imports, but

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:12.720
at the same time we do not

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.760
pay by exports, and exports

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:16.280
are shortened, then it means

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.280
that we are in debt, and we

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:19.900
have to borrow and borrow

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.520
to buy the same amount

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:25.080
of imports that we want to buy.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.360
The principle of trade

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:30.540
balance is this.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.980
Any restriction on imports

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.100
ultimately leads to restriction

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:34.180
on exports.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.320
From this, probably, the

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.960
second best principle is when liberalization

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.020
and international

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.680
trade are not bound by any

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.460
restrictions preferably

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.320
than international trade within

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.780
certain restrictions.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.640
Because, in this case, such international

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.480
competition allows the national

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:54.380
and world market to supply

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.320
the products that are

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:58.740
produced with the most effective

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.040
techniques and with the

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:03.640
most rational use

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.020
of production factors.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.660
International exchange is still

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.080
strongly linked to the international

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.580
mobility of production

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.680
factors.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.800
If we take, for example,

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.320
the economic territory on the

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.460
inner territory, in principle, between

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.440
cities, villages, agricultural

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.740
areas, we can say that in the

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.960
ideal is the absolute mobility

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.280
of the factors of production.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:41.300
Probably with the exception of Russia,

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:42.940
which has such territorial spaces

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.160
that for some factors of production

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:46.740
these territories

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:48.980
are barriers.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.120
But for the international economy, the

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.620
mobility of production factors is limited

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.800
by country barriers, first of all,

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.320
and the territorial location

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:59.140
of these countries.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.000
Let us take the example of Russia.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.080
So, we have a flow of migrant labor,

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:10.840
so to speak, population in the country,

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.340
and in principle the population

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.500
has increased in recent years,

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:16.300
and even the replacement of

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.280
natural population is occurring.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.100
But this suggests that the

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:22.360
average external mobility

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:24.760
of the workforce is quite high,

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:25.840
but the internal mobility

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:26.920
is quite low.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.260
Since January-April 2007 the number

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:31.300
of migrants inside Russia increased

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:34.960
by 9.5%.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:36.960
International migration has increased

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.820
by 54.5%.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.220
This is the result of the

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:46.140
migration growth, although

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.920
it is influenced by

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.880
various administrative factors,

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.860
state regulation factors, but

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.180
it does not occur.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.460
Migrants are moving from

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:59.300
foreign territories to

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:00.780
Russia, although external

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.660
migration has decreased in

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.620
recent years.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.840
So the example of migration

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:08.360
on the territory of Russia was

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:10.960
given because it is precisely depending

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.880
on how much the factor of production

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:15.000
is moved, they can be specific

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:16.680
only to the territory of

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:18.460
the national economy, or these

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.700
factors are mobile allow to

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.480
create these goods on any

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.300
territory.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.360
There are two categories

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.260
of goods: traded and non-traded.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.360
In the end, traded goods are easily

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.000
moved between countries,

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:38.420
thanks to commodity relations.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.280
And it is assumed that just if some

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.980
factors of production are not mobile,

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:46.320
they are replaced by exports

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.120
or imports of goods.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.600
If some factors are mobile, then

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:52.000
in principle, this production

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.000
can be organized abroad.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.940
Non-commercial goods are

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.160
consumed only in the country where

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.580
they are produced.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.600
And in this case, examples of non-

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:07.020
trade goods are primarily related to the

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.600
country’s infrastructure, with a number

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:11.680
of services.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.860
Non-trade means not participating

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.200
in international

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:16.180
exchange.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.060
This does not mean that they

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.000
are not in demand, but they

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:24.960
are limited by their special quality

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:26.640
of domestic demand and

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.680
therefore sold only in national

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.000
territories.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.770
Accordingly, the price of trade goods

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.570
is determined based on domestic

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.450
demand and world demand, practically

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.630
according to the system that

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.110
we have already considered

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.430
when establishing the world

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.490
price.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:46.350
But the prices of non-commercial

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.630
goods are established only by

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.470
domestic demand and supply.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:53.790
Of course, this division is relatively

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.610
conditional here, because in the

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.630
end, for example, in the creation

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.450
of non-commercial goods, some factors

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.310
of production that are quite mobile

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.230
and that have been priced

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.610
in the world can be used.

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:11.630
Take the same energy sources.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.850
And then it turns out that the final

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.710
price of non-trade goods, at

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.330
least the price of supply, will

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.010
depend on world prices.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:21.670
But on the other hand, in this case,

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.690
prices are taken, which are not influenced

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.490
by costs, but by the prices of

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.310
balance in the domestic market.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:29.730
That is, prices that are influenced

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.270
only by demand and prices that are

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.090
influenced only by a certain number

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.710
of offers and, in general, some

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.110
internal costs that are associated

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.530
with this offer.

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:44.630
Please look at the following

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.730
slide for examples of traded and

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.030
non-tradeable goods.

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.950
Such products, such

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.290
as agricultural

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.310
products, are

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.970
traded goods.

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:05.890
The products of the mining industries,

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.090
the processing industries,

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:10.130
are one of the normal

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.230
examples of traded goods.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.230
But non-commercial goods

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.070
are primarily utilities, construction,

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:19.090
wholesale retail trade in

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.370
this territory, because it

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.630
is related to this demand.

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:27.070
Transportation, storage, communication

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.050
and financial intermediation.

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:30.850
The truth in relation to the

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.230
sixth subparagraph could be disputed,

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.250
because in the modern conditions,

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:39.210
when transport services are developed,

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.610
transport services are often

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.710
provided by international transnational

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.990
logistics companies.

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.190
And then it turns out that

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.010
transport is already a tradable

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.930
commodity as such.

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:53.930
However, given that transportation

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.910
takes place in the territory

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.490
of this national economy, it

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.630
could be said that its prices for

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.690
these transportation services are

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.330
very influenced by the characteristics

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:06.430
of this national economy.

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.390
And eventually this goods can

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.990
be non-commerciable if the transport

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.310
is too far.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.830
From this point of view, the merchant

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.650
becomes non-commerciable not because he

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:19.390
is faulty or there is no demand for

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.710
him at all, then he is not a

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.990
commodity in principle.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.590
And it is influenced by some factors

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.810
related to the fact that it is not

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.770
available to the world market.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:34.050
Imagine, for example, the collection

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.010
of cedar nuts in some of the forests

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.370
of Siberia, which are quite a

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.210
tradable commodity for the

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.110
local market.

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.410
If you imagine that from there they

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.190
will have to be exported and brought

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.910
to Europe, then most likely the

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.650
costs of moving these products

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.130
will remain quite high.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:55.610
Based on this, this group of goods,

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.910
based on transport costs, will

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.950
be classified as non-tradeable.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.910
The non-commercial goods also

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.010
include a group of goods

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.190
that are related to

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.190
public public services,

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.810
education, healthcare,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.030
public works.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.410
In this case, it is assumed that

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:17.890
this is just that free social

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.870
block, which is guaranteed

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.590
regardless of the level of income

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.950
to all citizens of this

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.290
national economy.

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.390
Of course, you can imagine

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.490
that we have paid medical

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.930
departments, and then foreigners

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.190
come to our territory,

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.770
receive paid services.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:40.050
Thus, the service of education

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.830
becomes commerciable.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:43.870
In general, again, we can

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.730
say that he receives services

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:46.890
in our country.

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.370
We do not export this service

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.050
abroad, but imagine an exchange of teachers.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:52.550
And then our teacher abroad

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.410
provides a marketed education

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.090
service in foreign territory.

00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:58.450
Therefore, of course, the division

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.030
is relatively large, but the main

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.410
criterion for social services is,

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:04.850
of course, that they are mandatory

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.150
for all citizens at the expense

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.130
of budgetary funds, and therefore

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:11.930
not citizens of the country are

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:15.650
no longer allowed to this type of

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.050
goods and services.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:19.810
Various utilities and

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.970
social services also belong to this

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.170
group.

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:26.430
Suppose of course, the hotel services.

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.690
Again, the example is relative, because

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:32.250
if we consider that modern tourism

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.350
covers a hotel complex, then within

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.770
the framework of international

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.510
service tourism the hotel

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.890
complex is also transformed

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.210
into tradable goods.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:45.710
However, in this case, our examples

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.750
are needed to show how in the future

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:51.650
the traded and non-traded goods

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:54.770
affect international pricing as

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.590
a whole, how they affect the

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.390
consequences for countries related

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.450
to the rise of international

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.450
prices, with the development

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.670
of trade.

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:09.950
In particular, the Dutch pain is

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.610
related to the fact that

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.310
the commodities traded, export

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.350
goods can rise in price, to pull

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:19.790
into their sector of the

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:22.210
economy the very limited resources,

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.770
and then the sector of

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.830
non-commercial goods related

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.230
to national production will suffer.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.600
The terms of trading, to sum up,

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:36.340
are related to transportation

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:38.560
costs, trade barriers, prohibition

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:40.440
of exporting certain goods

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:42.600
for political or economic

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:46.040
reasons, and technical progress.

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.220
Technical progress is not

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:50.100
a trade barrier, but a

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:52.160
positive factor, because

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.100
in connection with technical

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:55.640
progress, for example, accessibility

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.280
to some territories is increased

00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:59.140
and, accordingly, products

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:00.140
created in these

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:01.360
territories become

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.860
tradable goods.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.360
Now, as for a more specific

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:11.760
question, prices are set in the

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.700
more specific sphere of international

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:16.580
economic relations in the course

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.920
of commodity circulation.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.060
First of all, these are wholesale prices

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:22.500
for industrial products, prices for

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:23.560
products, construction, purchase

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.420
prices, freight and passenger transport

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:26.640
tariffs, retail prices, tariffs

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:28.460
for payment services to

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.120
the population, prices for

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:31.800
servicing external trade turnover.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.580
As you can see, prices for serving

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:37.820
foreign trade turnover are only one

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:40.420
of the types of prices that

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:42.860
exist in the national market and participate

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.000
in the whole in the price

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.220
system in the territory of the

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:48.980
national economy.

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.100
And if we stop here in more detail,

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.740
wholesale prices can be both

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:56.100
domestic and international wholesale

00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.240
prices when organizing wholesale

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:01.840
deliveries.

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:04.200
These are the prices at which the company

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:06.060
sells the product to the consumer.

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:08.060
Accordingly, it is assumed that the wholesale

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.780
price of the enterprise is the price that

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:11.680
is established, one can say, for the

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:13.840
goods that are purchased from the warehouse

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:15.760
of the enterprise, from the warehouse

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:17.180
of the enterprise that produces

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:18.620
this good.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.780
But the wholesale price of industry

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.860
is already a more average price.

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.240
This price is due to the fact that it

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.960
is the price at which the products

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.240
are paid to the company-manufacturer.

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.540
And accordingly, this will already

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:34.440
include some taxes and, possibly,

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.120
depending on the terms of the

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:38.780
contract, transport costs.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:40.660
Purchase prices are the prices

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:41.580
at which the

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:43.040
products are sold.

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:44.980
The economic agent

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:47.440
is the state.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.600
But these procurement prices

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:50.960
on state contracts, the

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.700
predetermination of tender, applications

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:56.200
for state supplies can affect

00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:57.580
not only domestic

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.600
producers, but also foreign.

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:01.280
Therefore, the purchase price

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:04.520
is a very real price for wholesale

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:08.640
and retail supplies of various

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:13.020
types of agricultural values,

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.860
by which goods are sold in

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.600
retail trade by enterprises,

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:19.040
organizations, the population.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:25.620
Retail price by cost, a big

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.760
price compared to everything else,

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:30.900
medium, small and wholesale

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:31.540
prices.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:31.800
Why is?

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.460
Because it will include all value

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:35.940
added taxes, it will include

01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:37.480
all transportation costs, additional

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.260
services that each of the

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:41.040
consumers provided so that

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.960
our products eventually come

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:46.180
from the producer to the

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:47.580
end consumer.

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:51.130
The price can be divided

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.570
into free and

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.130
fixed prices.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:55.370
Such a division is generally

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:56.650
relevant to international

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.130
economic relations, since the

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.630
state, being a free economic

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.970
agent, can also, possessing

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.910
state property, produce

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.190
certain prices of goods

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.790
and services, respectively,

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:11.690
fix prices for some

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.230
products.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:14.930
Free prices are influenced

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:16.770
by the demand of the offer

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.650
in the global market.

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:23.990
We also need to turn the marketing approach

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.650
into price formation, which is associated

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.370
with the activities of

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.750
international companies, both

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.970
medium and large.

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:32.930
For example, such an option as

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.930
branding is associated with such

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.470
policies of large firms as the

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.830
policy of cream leaf.

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:42.270
It is assumed that this company has

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.490
already established itself

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.290
in the international market

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.650
as a quality manufacturer,

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:49.870
forming a sufficiently full consumer.

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.430
And then these brand prices

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.750
are quite high.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.970
The only form of their more or less

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.510
lower brand price is to transfer

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.370
the right to use the brand of

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.090
the company name for

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.930
the production of some goods in

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:09.850
its territory.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.610
Then, maybe these prices will

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.530
drop a little.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:14.770
But, nevertheless, here are brand prices,

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.950
they are also associated with

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.210
the orientation of such a demand, on the

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.110
company demand.

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:25.390
When certain types of goods are prestigious,

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.810
and then the consumer is willing

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.210
to overpay for products, despite

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:31.610
what the international market

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.110
would seem, it must lead to

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.330
the fact that the prices of these

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.770
goods are somehow aligned and

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.190
lowered compared to those

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.610
prices that exist on the separate

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.870
national markets.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:46.050
Furthermore, price differentiation

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.530
can be used in

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.810
pricing.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:51.730
That is, when large firms,

01:02:56.150 --> 01:03:00.270
firms, which are called brands,

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.890
they try to break down by income

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.830
level all consumers of the region

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.450
or other, where they

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.470
export, and offer them a different

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.690
price option for almost

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.010
the same products.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.570
And then there are prices economy

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.650
class, premium class, business class.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.710
And while the firms, of course, prove

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.830
that the quality of these

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.450
goods is somewhat varied, in

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.870
terms of the firm’s net costs

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:32.230
to create and transport the products

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.470
themselves, they are much

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.930
lower than those prices that

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.590
are set for the class,

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.370
for example, premium.

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:46.830
Well, and this policy

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.390
of international companies, large

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.530
enough, because they don’t act

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.290
on the global market.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.870
This is a policy of market

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.530
seizure, a policy of

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.810
dumping prices.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.670
That is, it is assumed that firms

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.570
urgently develop a strategy, according

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.350
to which they lower prices

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.710
for the products that are

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.630
offered for this market.

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:11.190
Often, pay attention, for example,

01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:13.130
to the gray schemes in Russia are introduced

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.790
goods that were supposed

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.310
to be introduced by some third

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.070
countries.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.350
Why is?

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.070
Because the price of these goods

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.750
is underestimated, based on the purchasing

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.910
power of those countries that

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.510
must accept these goods.

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:28.550
But, on the basis of the purchasing

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.570
power of Russian consumers,

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.210
the value should have been

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.030
slightly higher.

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:35.790
So, this is also a variant of such hidden

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.070
dumping, indeed, at the expense of the gray

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:39.750
schemes.

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:42.290
Per because of this it happens that in

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:44.630
principle countries with open dumping

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.850
are still fighting with such a process,

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.850
especially the members of

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.590
the World Trade Organization.

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:52.270
And there is always

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.470
some state mechanism, state

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.450
measures that will try to punish

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.650
the company and prove that

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.270
if it really introduces

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.090
goods at dumped prices, then

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.150
it is unfair and imperfect

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.330
competition, and

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.750
it can be punished.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.970
Thus, we are still approaching such

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.350
a question as types of world prices.

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.050
Basically, these prices

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.210
are classified according to how

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:24.370
payments are organized at

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.370
world prices.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.950
And then the prices of trading

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.330
transactions with payments in freely

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.310
convertible currency are obtained.

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.010
You understand, freely

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.010
convertible means, quite hard currency,

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.830
so probably, a little bit these

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:39.010
prices can be made below.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.550
Prices for trading transactions

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.370
with payments in non-convertable currency.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.190
Of course, for insurance against the

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.930
risks of fluctuation of this currency,

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.770
probably, prices will be a little higher.

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:50.890
Prices under clearing agreements

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.450
are assumed to be like barter

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.310
exchange.

01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:56.050
As a result of various transactions,

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.570
the difference in export-import

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.470
flow is eventually calculated and

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.850
in this case it is assumed

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.910
that these are already operations

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.870
related to donation, economic

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:18.950
assistance.

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:21.550
They, in general, should also be present.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:21.830
Why is?

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:24.030
Because imagine what the Emergency Service

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.690
is providing in some country, where it

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.110
will replace the shake of help.

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:30.370
They carry goods with them.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.710
Goods cross borders.

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:33.210
And this border, once the goods

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.590
cross, it must be shredded.

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:36.390
And then there are prices for

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.430
non-trade operations.

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:39.910
Of course, these are prices that should

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.750
be reduced to the lowest possible level

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:43.810
so that the country that provides

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.670
such economic assistance does not suffer.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:49.570
Transfer prices, intra-company prices

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.410
are another variant of international

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.630
prices associated with the activities

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.830
of transnational corporations.

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:57.630
Transnational corporations understand

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.670
that if they have located

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.230
in different countries of the world,

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.770
then if they give each enterprise

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.990
the opportunity to write

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.850
the highest possible price,

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.670
then the total costs

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.050
they will have will be

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.070
just huge.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:13.790
They are developing a reverse policy.

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:15.490
They calculate such

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.390
transfer prices that only

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.610
cover the costs of the

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.130
company that creates them.

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:25.650
There may be some average profit.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:26.050
Why is?

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:27.150
Because the distribution

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.370
of financial income is based

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.930
on the calculated average

01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:34.950
value per unit of capital

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.590
between these firms.

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:42.810
Transfer prices are generally a

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.230
rather interesting area of international

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.990
economic relations, which

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.990
in developed countries is

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.930
subject to regulation.

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:51.170
Why is?

01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:52.950
Because it is connected with taxes,

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.330
with international flows,

01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:55.450
respectively with international

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:56.790
taxation, this is, so to speak,

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.430
the national taxation

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.990
of these goods, which are carried

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:03.170
out at transversal prices.

01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:05.330
If the state, so to speak, engages

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:06.950
the expansion of its transnational

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.890
corporations, it will be blind

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.110
to the transversal prices,

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.890
as well as the fact that the

01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:13.890
main taxes will be paid

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.290
by these firms in the ashore

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.250
zones.

01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:19.430
An example is the United States.

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.250
Basically, despite the US company,

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.510
they use such a mechanism and do not

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.470
receive, do not add taxes to the

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.390
US government.

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:38.370
This measure is a measure

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.190
to stimulate exporting

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.750
transnational companies.

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:44.850
And this struggle over “yes, yes,

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.510
no” and why you treat your

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.930
transnational corporations so is

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:50.210
related to the struggle of

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.050
globalists or, rather, anti-

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.230
globalists.

01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:55.570
And when discussions take

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.710
place within the WTO,

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.030
they usually say,

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.610
“You encourage your transnational

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.110
corporations, you artificially

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.150
stimulate them,

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.770
you have hidden exports

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.310
stimulating through

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.670
these transcendent

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.850
prices and by

01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:12.550
leaving offshore

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.430
taxation.”

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.630
Well in response the US says, in

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:18.690
Europe, and what do you

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.490
encourage and support

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.970
your agricultural producers?

01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.350
Why is?

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:26.850
Because 50% of the budget, the

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.290
single such a joint budget

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.590
of the European Union goes to stimulate,

01:09:30.730 --> 01:09:32.750
direct stimulation of

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.150
its agricultural producers.

01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:35.910
They are supplying the difference

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.990
between the price and cost

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.450
of production and the cheaper

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:41.910
price at which they can sell

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.230
these goods on the world market.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.470
Thus, summarizing the reasoning

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.910
about transperteous prices, you can

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:50.450
give them a definition of what they

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:51.610
use when supplying semi-

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.530
barricades, nodes, parts, components.

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:56.810
The Rule is the subject of a

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:57.970
commercial secret.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.190
They are used by international

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.710
associations, various transnational

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.870
corporations and their branches

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.770
located in different countries

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.870
of the world.

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.490
Now, the prices that become

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.230
directly in the contract.

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:13.170
You are contract prices.

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:15.570
In principle, there may be different receptions

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:16.790
in the contract.

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:19.090
If you have a one-off delivery, then

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.210
you may have a tough fixation, sorry,

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.590
price in the contract.

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:28.110
If you have a supply for

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.390
a longer period, then you

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.470
expect some currency

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.810
leaps, inflation leaps.

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:37.350
And once so, the hard price is no

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.710
longer established, it is bound to

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.710
some principle, it may be to the exchange

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.390
rate of some solid convertible

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.930
world currency, but nevertheless

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.210
the price becomes more flexible.

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:53.850
If further fluctuations in market

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.650
prices for some goods are expected, then

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.210
it may be that the firms conclude

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.030
such a general contract, but with each

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.650
before delivery, the price will

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.850
be specified separately in this

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.470
period of time.

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:10.130
Thus, the price that will result will be

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.630
the contract price with the correction

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.630
of the current fluctuations in market

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.370
prices.

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:17.970
And another type of price is

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.310
the sliding price, for which it

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.370
depends on the cost.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:24.030
Of course, such a contract price is related

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.370
to the provision of international

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.270
construction services.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.570
And when a certain company won the tender

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.430
for construction can be complexes, then

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.370
in the process of creating such a service

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.790
as the construction of a shopping

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.970
center, it can increase costs in

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:45.310
connection with the price of

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.330
raw materials.

01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:48.350
Based on this contract, a

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.090
moving price is established, depending

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:51.850
on the costs.

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:56.210
Accordingly, there may be some

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.150
intermediate price variant mixed

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.050
form, when a part of the price

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.390
is rigidly financed, and the other

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.850
part is sliding depending on

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.230
the factors specified

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.510
in the contract.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:10.690
Another component of the contract that

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:12.510
is associated with the word price

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:13.910
is the price currency.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.190
The currency in which the price

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.290
of the goods is set in the contract

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.410
is called the price currency.

01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:34.350
In certain currencies the obligation

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.670
of the importer will be expressed.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:41.150
Moreover, the payment currency is indicated

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.650
in the most stable currency, assuming

01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:45.330
that the supplier will not lose

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.790
from the fall of the exchange

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.690
rate of some currency.

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:53.670
Even if you have a currency

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.870
price indicated in hryvnia, the currency

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.850
of payment can be indicated

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.610
in dollars at a certain exchange

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.990
rate, a certain large trading

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.770
exchange or a central bank.

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:09.990
Thus, we have considered the

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.330
price process with you, it may

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:13.610
be quite in a schematic

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:16.270
form, but I have tried

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.230
to present you with the whole

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.770
range of prices that may exist

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.190
in the world market.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.940
Now, let us move to the next topic

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:32.020
of our course modern development

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:34.740
of international economic relations.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.660
In modern conditions, the traditional

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:39.560
forms of mail as foreign

01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:41.680
trade, capital migration,

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:43.560
currency relations develop

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:46.380
at the same rapid pace as in

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:49.760
the past historical period,

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:52.440
but nevertheless, a number of

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:56.100
other forms have appeared and

01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:57.980
have taken their place

01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.360
in the system of international

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.160
economic relations.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.880
Pay attention to the slide.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.820
In this case, we have listed

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:13.220
about 10 modern forms of

01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:15.580
international economic relations.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.800
To international trade, to

01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:19.460
credit relations, to currency and

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.180
pay-and-pay relations as traditional

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:24.480
exports of capital, to international

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:27.240
migration of labor.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.200
International integration processes

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:33.680
have been added.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.900
There has been the development

01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:38.340
of transnational corporations and

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:41.160
international credit and financial institutions.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.100
The interstate regulation

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.500
of international economic relations

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:47.400
is developing at a rapid pace.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.380
The activities of international

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:53.220
financial institutions such

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.180
as the International Monetary Fund

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.620
have become important.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.080
There is a whole stream of new

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.360
international economic relations,

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:04.240
such as international technology

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.620
transfer.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.220
We briefly describe the forms.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.300
So what are the reasons for the

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:20.120
growth of international trade in goods and services?

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.960
Why does international trade not

01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:25.440
lose its positions in the world space?

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:28.080
First of all, this is a traditional

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.720
reason for the development of international

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:31.700
division of labour, as we have

01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:34.720
already noted, not only at the level

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.700
of commodity, but also

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:38.240
operational, detailed division

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:41.140
of labour, when individual activities

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:43.160
or components are created

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:45.300
in all countries of the world,

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:47.820
and then brought to final

01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:51.000
production in some second-

01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:53.380
third country.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.980
The next component is the development

01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:58.040
of national production and exchange.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.560
Of course, once the national

01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:02.100
economy in its development stabilizes,

01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:06.000
then for the companies producers

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:08.840
domestic demand, the domestic

01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:11.480
market becomes tight and, of course,

01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.960
they begin to offer their goods

01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:17.300
and services to the international

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:18.640
market.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.740
And considering that there are

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:25.640
customs barriers in countries

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:28.380
or some other foreign trade they begin

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.020
to develop these producers,

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.920
their national production to the

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:32.820
level of international,

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:34.640
transferring production

01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:36.800
activities to those countries

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:38.820
of the world where the use

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:42.520
of cheap resources is more efficient.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
The next reason for the development

01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:46.820
of international trade is the

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:48.560
inequality of the development of individual

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.780
industries.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840
In any country, there can be

01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:55.780
a situation where the domestic

01:16:55.790 --> 01:17:01.640
consumer will be unhappy

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:04.100
with the offer of goods and

01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:05.340
services presented

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:08.160
on the domestic market.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.540
The deficit of domestic demand will

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:12.880
then push for imports of goods and

01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:14.540
services from abroad.

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:15.800
Accordingly, the supply

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:17.740
surplus is due to the growth

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:18.980
of domestic production

01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:23.960
in the export of goods and services.

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:27.650
The next reason for countries

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.330
with a market economy is the tendency

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:32.290
to constantly expand production

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.830
in order to obtain freebies.

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:39.510
Any company, even if it will

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.330
set itself some social goals

01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.650
of consumer satisfaction,

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:46.270
yet it has a very definite

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.670
economic goal - maximizing

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.010
profits with available

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.870
resources.

01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:55.170
Therefore, of course, the constantly

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:56.810
expanding production and simply

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.430
the pattern, the dependence of the

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:03.210
development of any economy

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.450
with market relations.

01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:06.290
Consider the geographical

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.290
structure of international trade.

01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:12.330
The main suppliers and importers

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:14.470
of products in the world

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.490
market are, of course,

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.690
developed countries.

01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:20.970
This is due to the fact that the

01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:25.090
level of income of end consumers

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.570
and the level of income of industrial

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.210
consumers is quite high, and

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:33.650
they have a high demand potential.

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:35.750
Thus, if you use the marketing

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.550
term, such market potential,

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.250
market volume, it is quite

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.730
high in developed countries

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.910
and, of course, what new

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.090
products are offered to such

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.070
developed consumers in

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.990
such economies.

01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:57.370
The second component by which international

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.170
flow of goods and services is

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.250
the growth of the share of developing

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:02.390
countries.

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:07.130
Indeed, as shown in our list,

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.590
it is the share of developing

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.730
countries that is growing.

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:17.010
This is due to the previously less developed economy.

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:20.150
All in the framework of the development

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.530
of trade relations and the development

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:26.490
of market relations, they supplement

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.970
their production capabilities and

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:31.330
engage not only in exports, but also in

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.890
imports to the world market.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.690
The next factor that influences international

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.510
trade is the growth in the share

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:41.170
of countries with transitional economies.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.830
Pay attention to the splash.

01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:45.710
In this case, it represents an account

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.050
of current operations in different

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.390
groups of countries.

01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:55.750
As you can see, in the US, the current

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.710
account has a negative value,

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.190
which means imports are more exports.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:05.570
But China is out of the lead, it has

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.550
a fairly high account of current

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:10.790
operations, but if you look

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.890
at other countries in the world, it

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:16.550
turns out that other developing

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.710
countries also have a

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.270
positive trade balance and,

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.730
accordingly, a positive

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.930
account of current operations.

01:20:24.010 --> 01:20:25.170
Thus, this picture

01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:27.290
confirms that truly developing

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.430
countries are beginning

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.250
to win an increasing share

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.010
in foreign trade.

01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:37.810
This is contributed by economic growth

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:40.130
in several developing countries.

01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:43.330
What is our next slide?

01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:45.370
As you can see, the percentage

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.970
changes in real GDP in developing

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.150
countries tend to

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.590
be steady.

01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:52.090
The trend towards growth in foreign

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.750
trade of developing countries

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.930
is confirmed by the economic

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.930
growth rates in these countries.

01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:59.890
Pay attention to the slide.

01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:01.990
As the data shows, if, for example,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.550
in the 80s, the average growth rate

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.210
among the developing countries reached

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:10.030
around 3%, then in the 95s about

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.730
4%, but somewhere by 2008 - in the

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:18.350
period from 2005 - 2008 - this is

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.450
on average 6% and above the growth.

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.250
Accordingly, analysts of the World

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.590
Bank conducting research on the

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.990
group of developing countries,

01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:32.410
prove that this trend reflects

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.470
the trend to globalization

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.050
in the economy.

01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:38.570
And developing countries, which

01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:40.350
have rebuilt their economies

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.570
and started to develop export-

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.490
oriented industries, have created

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.790
a trend towards favorable

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.010
economic growth.

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:50.350
And the following slide shows us

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.670
the statistics of the share of developing

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.890
countries in the exports of

01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:59.490
developed countries.

01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:01.570
The leaders of foreign trade

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:04.350
are developed countries.

01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:06.330
But if, for example, in the earlier

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:11.410
period, the share of developing countries

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.310
was only 22% of the share of trade

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.790
of developed countries, then starting

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.170
in the last years, in the 2000s,

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.550
it is already about 45% of

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:29.170
the total level of foreign

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.330
trade of developed countries.

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:34.370
What suggests that the trend is positive

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.330
and, indeed, developing countries

01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:38.930
are changing their position in

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:42.110
the world economy and are beginning

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.630
to take on more and more

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.070
stable positions.

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:50.430
Of course, these trends do not

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.750
concern the group of underdeveloped

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.530
countries, which in general, and

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:56.910
especially participate in international

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.670
trade, so-called low-income

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.770
countries.

01:23:03.130 --> 01:23:04.650
But in this case, of course,

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:06.050
the indicator we have here

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.710
refers to those countries

01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:10.030
that have industrialized,

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.470
so-called new industrialized

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.650
countries, including

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:15.550
China.

01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:17.630
I draw your attention to the fact

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.850
that, despite the fact that China is

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.170
the leader in the current conditions

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.590
of world trade in terms of growth,

01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:28.190
but the level of income of the population

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.450
in one or another strange per

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:32.430
capita is precisely determining

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.510
which group will be classified

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.230
developed or developing

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.950
countries.

01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:40.590
Look at the next shot.

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:41.910
Here are examples of developing

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.050
countries of Vietnam and India.

01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:45.990
Vietnam has recently been

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.370
rapidly developing the

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.750
industries related to light

01:23:49.890 --> 01:23:53.530
industry production in its factories

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.790
and factories and is being

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:00.130
included in the world integration

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.110
processes at the level

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.530
of detailed or operational

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.030
division of labour.

01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:10.150
And per capita income

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.430
in Vietnam, GDP per capita,

01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:19.070
this level is quite small,

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:23.890
which is only $ 822 per capita.

01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:25.530
If we take India in this case,

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.550
the per capita income level

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.770
is slightly higher, but

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.750
also quite low.

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:35.990
Now let’s pay attention to China.

01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:41.050
I have already said that China

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.350
is developing a export-oriented sector

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.730
by substantial capital investments

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:50.710
in the southern region of the

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.050
country, such an industrial enclave

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.990
that is focused on international

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.050
consumer demand.

01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:03.730
The level of income, that is,

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.770
the gross domestic product per GDP,

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.070
is already $2,000, even more than $2,

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.990
000, which shows that in general,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.550
it is a group of developing countries,

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.010
it is quite diverse,

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.350
but China is still in the

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.230
developing countries.

01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:23.390
While, of course, analyzing its

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.190
turbulent foreign economic

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.490
activity, China says they cannot

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:31.670
be called a catching economy.

01:25:31.730 --> 01:25:32.050
Why is?

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:34.570
Because they lead in terms

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.370
of growth, in terms of development,

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.450
in terms of gross domestic

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:40.910
product, in terms of growth, export

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:42.250
and import.

01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:45.910
And although on average, the

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.470
current programs within the national

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.510
macroeconomy make such a rapid

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.350
growth rate slightly decrease, because,

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.550
look, the growth rate isined

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.110
at the level of 10 -9%, but the

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.190
exports of 26% in 2003 were slightly

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.330
restricted by the exports

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.010
in 2007 -19%, and yet these

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:10.870
are quite high indicators.

01:26:11.290 --> 01:26:15.330
Thus, China, being a serious

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.630
competitor to developed countries

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.210
in the international trade market,

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:21.690
remains the leader in foreign

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.170
trade relations, but for now it

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.230
is a developing country.

01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:28.410
For comparison, in order

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.790
for the country to move into

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.050
the group, at least,

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.670
so to speak, the level

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.590
of GDP per capita income

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.950
should be about $ 6 thousand.

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:43.490
The example is the developed country

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.270
of the United States.

01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:47.730
As you can see, the situation here

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:52.310
is such that the gross domestic

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.490
product per capita is more than

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.490
$45 thousand.

01:26:57.230 --> 01:27:00.010
Of course, the United States is

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.610
not the leader in this case, but

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:03.950
the rate of economic growth

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.190
is at the growth of gross

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.810
domestic product at 2 percent,

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:11.590
and exports and imports at the

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.290
level of 5-6 percent.

01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:16.990
That is, in general, the pace of foreign

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.930
trade and foreign trade development

01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:27.730
is shown in previous slides, where

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:31.150
the growth of the share of developing

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.670
countries was proven, is linked

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.710
to this trend.

01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:37.270
The rate of development in developing countries

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.930
is higher in many indicators than the

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.410
rate of development of developed countries.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:44.150
For example, a new market economy

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.610
can serve Russia, and despite

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.390
the fact that we are a large country

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.330
in terms of territory and economy,

01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:54.870
so the growth rates of the major

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:57.230
industrialized countries are usually

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.590
quite small, then compared

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.090
to the two percent we just

01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:02.570
saw in the United States,

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:05.110
we have a growth of gross

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.870
domestic product at the

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.690
level of eight to six percent.

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:13.410
Accordingly, both exports

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:15.770
and imports also have a rather

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:18.690
dynamic growth rate of 6 to 15

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.290
percent.

01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:23.430
The trend to the fact that in the

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.690
last three years our net exports

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:29.350
suddenly began to decline is due to

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:37.070
the fact that, as the Central Bank

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.550
shows, the ruble body is increasing,

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.050
and accordingly our firms and economic

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.650
agents in the form of households

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.090
are able to buy, buy more goods

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.550
and services for the available

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.890
rubles, that is why we have

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.910
in recent years is an increase

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.230
in certain imports compared to

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.450
exports, but nevertheless the

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.210
balance of the payment balance

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.570
in Russia is positive, and such

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.470
a trend does not threaten yet

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.950
not domestic Russian producers,

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.370
not the payment capacity

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.730
of the country, its currency

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.810
rate and trade balance.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.280
What is the structure of foreign trade

01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:26.620
for all countries?

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.660
I will emphasize that it is for all

01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:30.780
countries, because in principle,

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:33.500
world demand, of course, will be dictated

01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:35.600
mainly by developed countries,

01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:37.740
and if even developing countries,

01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:40.200
for example, what serves there, suppose

01:29:40.210 --> 01:29:42.520
China, are trying to develop

01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:44.700
their exports, of course, the main

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:46.820
consumer for China are developed

01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:52.520
countries, the supply flows of

01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:54.620
goods will come from the structure

01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:56.120
of needs that are accepted

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.720
in developed countries.

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.440
Three-quarters of the products

01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:02.180
are manufactured, with

01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:03.780
equipment and vehicles

01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:05.180
accounting for

01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:08.180
half of the group.

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.760
The next subgroup is chemistry,

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.640
black colored metals.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.880
This subgroup is also dominant,

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.720
and therefore complements

01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:21.740
equipment and vehicles.

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:25.060
In a lesser degree, the products

01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:28.320
of the manufacturing industry are

01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:30.260
associated with the light industry

01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:32.400
movement, but textile, nevertheless,

01:30:32.410 --> 01:30:34.260
is another component

01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:35.960
- it is the commodity structure

01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:38.660
of world foreign trade.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.420
A quarter of foreign trade flows

01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:44.820
fall on raw materials and food.

01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:47.540
This ratio of processing products

01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:49.780
and raw materials indicates

01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:52.540
that countries that develop

01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:55.300
their foreign trade with

01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:58.240
a focus on raw materials or

01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:00.820
food supply have some

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:03.760
constraints in economic growth

01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:06.320
because demand for raw materials

01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:09.860
and food is stable and,

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:12.380
as economists say, it

01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:14.840
is not elastic

01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:16.200
in price.

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.680
That is, if even prices will fall

01:31:17.690 --> 01:31:19.700
on this commodity, then the demand

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:22.880
in the world for raw materials and

01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:24.760
food will not increase sharply, there

01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:27.460
is a certain level of this consumption.

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.840
But the demand for equipment,

01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:31.600
its various modifications, types,

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:33.100
it can be blasphemed at the

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:34.880
expense of technical progress

01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:36.380
and, accordingly, always offer

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:39.020
new products or services that

01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:42.500
will allow consumers

01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:44.540
to pay attention to them

01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:46.780
and, ultimately, to purchase.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.980
Therefore, if a country tries

01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:50.700
to integrate itself into the modern

01:31:50.710 --> 01:31:53.260
world economy, if a country tries

01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:55.120
to win certain positions in this

01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:56.660
world economy and not to be only

01:31:56.670 --> 01:31:58.040
a raw material additive, respectively,

01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.200
to depend on world prices,

01:31:59.210 --> 01:32:01.100
then it must necessarily try

01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:03.880
to increase the share of products,

01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:06.080
manufacturing industry.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.200
Then they have the chances

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:09.760
of a transitional economy to become

01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:12.900
a more developed market economy.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:16.560
The general trend of growth

01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:19.820
in world trade is such that the

01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:22.420
growth rate of foreign trade for

01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:24.240
a long period, probably 50

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:27.400
years, exceeds the growth rate

01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:29.520
of industrial production.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.880
This is precisely due to the fact that,

01:32:31.890 --> 01:32:34.940
as I have already said, in terms of detailed

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:37.140
and operational division of labour,

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:38.980
such flows as the flows of components,

01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:42.440
some semi-fabricates, which are

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.100
assembled there in third countries,

01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:47.660
are forced to be organized.

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.840
And another trend we talked about is

01:32:50.850 --> 01:32:54.140
that the growth rate of trade in

01:32:54.150 --> 01:32:56.400
developing countries is higher than

01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:59.020
that of the developed countries.

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:02.380
What are the reasons for

01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:04.680
export-oriented development of certain

01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:06.940
countries, and in particular

01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:09.420
the reasons for export-oriented development

01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:11.340
that developing countries

01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:13.940
choose for themselves.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.520
The so-called new

01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:17.140
industrial countries of the

01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:20.900
first and second wave, which

01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:22.960
the basis of their macroeconomic

01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:27.520
policies in the 60s put the development

01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:28.960
of export-oriented

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:30.760
industries.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.700
Their activities show that in principle

01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:35.800
they have won in such a competitive

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:37.420
struggle, and they

01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:38.860
really have per capita

01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:40.960
income, that is, GDP per

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:43.500
capita is growing.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.020
What reasons can be identified here?

01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.200
First, there is limited

01:33:48.210 --> 01:33:49.720
domestic demand.

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:53.500
Of course, if you look at not the

01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:55.260
gross domestic product per capita,

01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:57.480
but the real disposable income of

01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:59.960
the population itself, the

01:33:59.970 --> 01:34:02.240
indicator will be several times

01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:04.700
lower than the indicator of

01:34:04.710 --> 01:34:06.720
the gross domestic product.

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.880
And accordingly, domestic demand is

01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:11.500
limited by the purchasing

01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:13.680
power of the population and

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.480
does not have expanded capabilities.

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.180
On the other hand, once export-

01:34:19.190 --> 01:34:21.760
oriented countries develop, certain

01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:23.260
successes and China

01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:26.000
is the example of that, then

01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:28.580
just part of the

01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:29.620
industry can reorient

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.420
to domestic demand.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.580
And in China’s strategic development

01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:35.820
projects, the Chinese government

01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:38.580
is laying on elements of stimulating

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:39.940
domestic demand, hoping

01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:42.500
that the rise in the level of

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.100
income of the population, real

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.080
income of the population,

01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:48.200
related in particular to the fact

01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:49.660
that they were employed in

01:34:49.670 --> 01:34:51.240
export industries and received

01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:53.320
high incomes, higher wages,

01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:55.580
will now stimulate the further

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:58.080
development of industry.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.880
And export-oriented economies

01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:02.520
like China will likely be less

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.340
dependent on international demand

01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:06.280
and international cataclysms

01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:07.600
with domestic demand

01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:08.880
revenue growth.

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:11.520
The next factor

01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:13.340
of export-oriented development is,

01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:15.800
of course, the presence of cheap

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:17.860
resources, or excess labor, or

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.860
some other natural, for example,

01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:21.200
resources.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.260
Excess means that domestic

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:25.260
industry, domestic production

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.560
demand does not experience need

01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:29.440
for these resources, and there

01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:31.400
is most likely a high

01:35:31.410 --> 01:35:32.500
unemployment.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.560
And in this case, one of

01:35:36.570 --> 01:35:39.560
the ways to get out of a situation

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.800
where its own industry, oriented

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.020
towards the domestic market,

01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:44.380
does not need such a

01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:47.660
number of labor, is that

01:35:47.670 --> 01:35:51.100
of organizing production,

01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:52.320
oriented only to export

01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:54.740
and world demand.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:59.140
The next reason why countries

01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:01.460
that chose export-oriented

01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:02.900
production are given the advantage

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.780
is, first of all, the opportunity

01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:07.000
to attract foreign

01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:08.440
investment.

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.220
All the new industrial countries

01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:12.400
were precisely industrialized

01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:15.660
by the flow of capital from developed

01:36:15.670 --> 01:36:19.000
countries, direct foreign investment,

01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:23.340
which was the organization of

01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:25.400
the same factories and factories

01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:27.920
that were limited in their

01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:30.640
expansion in the developed

01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:33.180
countries precisely because

01:36:33.190 --> 01:36:34.860
in the developed countries

01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:36.180
there was no influx of

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:40.420
fresh labor on the one hand,

01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:42.420
and on the other, the level

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.420
of wages, and consequently

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.360
the costs for firms are

01:36:47.370 --> 01:36:49.320
quite high.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.540
And so, the same example that has already

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.800
been given in the district tables,

01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:55.060
for example, China at the present stage

01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:58.100
is already ceasing to be the cheapest

01:36:58.110 --> 01:37:01.560
factory in the world and the level of

01:37:01.570 --> 01:37:03.120
income of the population is growing in

01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:05.420
connection with the increase of wages,

01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:07.960
but another, for example, such a block

01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:10.660
as Vietnam, means that you can

01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:12.480
organize cheaper production

01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:13.880
there and accordingly it attracts

01:37:13.890 --> 01:37:15.740
foreign investors and in terms of

01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:18.040
profit for the country this is

01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:20.980
the acquisition of new technologies.

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.880
Moreover, technology will be associated

01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:23.920
not only with production processes,

01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:25.780
but also with new technologies of management

01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:29.000
and marketing, which enables transitional

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:30.880
economies, for example, or developing

01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:33.000
countries, which have recently

01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:35.600
entered the market path of development,

01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:38.620
to attract advanced technologies

01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:42.500
in the organization of production,

01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:44.120
which can give such

01:37:44.130 --> 01:37:46.560
a multiplied effect.

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:51.030
What are the consequences of world trade?

01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:53.530
On the one hand, one could

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.010
say that there are two

01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:58.570
negative factors.

01:37:59.050 --> 01:38:01.030
This increases dependence on exports and

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.350
increases dependence on imports.

01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:06.250
But, in principle, probably for

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.290
the economy, which is developing

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.430
fairly stable, such a dependence

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.910
is not scary.

01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:14.010
And we have already said that, for

01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.410
example, for small European countries,

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:18.510
the export or import quota

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.210
is more than 100%.

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.930
On the other hand, for large economies

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.650
with a large national market, such

01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:26.610
as Russia and the United States,

01:38:27.170 --> 01:38:30.150
the export quota reaches only 20%.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.070
So the dependency here is generally

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.110
relative.

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:37.550
The next consequences of the development

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.130
of world trade are consequences

01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.330
of a positive nature for consumers

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.370
of the national economy.

01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:47.250
Of course, imports lead

01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.270
to lower domestic prices

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.730
and increased range

01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:55.750
to satisfy consumer needs.

01:38:55.810 --> 01:38:58.570
Another consequence that national

01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:01.450
economic agents benefit

01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.350
from is the level

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.530
of income of workers.

01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:07.790
Japan can be an example of this

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.350
level of equalization of workers.

01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:12.330
In postwar Japan, it developed

01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:16.190
rapidly as a nationally-

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.870
oriented industry.

01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:22.190
It is because the sufficiently

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.750
skilled labor force of Japan

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.210
had a fairly low level of

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:28.530
income, respectively, low

01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:30.690
level of costs for firms.

01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:33.190
But, let’s say, if we compare

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:34.690
with the modern period, then slowly

01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:36.150
such economic growth

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.850
equalized the level

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:38.790
of income.

01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:40.330
And now the income level, the average

01:39:40.450 --> 01:39:41.610
wage earned in Japan is higher,

01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:43.190
even than in the United States.

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:48.560
Therefore, in general, for developing

01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:50.840
countries in the long term

01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:52.680
development of export-oriented

01:39:52.690 --> 01:39:55.100
production, in general, is a

01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:57.980
positive moment.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.080
The following consequences, as I said,

01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:01.840
are the development of export-

01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:03.600
oriented industries.

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:09.220
And here, in general, there are its contradictions.

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.760
And these contradictions are related

01:40:11.770 --> 01:40:13.560
to the position of the Dutch disease.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.800
The Dutch disease is a disproportionate

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:18.880
development of export

01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:20.080
industries.

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.520
And within these contradictions,

01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:25.060
the creation of a situation where the

01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:27.740
income of owners of production factors

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:30.180
in export industries is much higher

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:32.760
than in import-substitute industries.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.660
And the import-substitute industries

01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:39.580
still suffer from the fact that

01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:41.580
they lack resources, and ultimately

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:43.780
a certain economic decline is

01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:49.820
possible in the overall rate of the

01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:51.320
national currency.

01:40:51.330 --> 01:40:52.880
Again, if exports are developed

01:40:52.890 --> 01:40:54.500
in large volumes and above

01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:56.560
imports, the influx of foreign

01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:58.680
currency into the country will

01:40:58.690 --> 01:40:59.940
ultimately lead to an

01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:01.840
increase in the domestic

01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:03.160
exchange rate.

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.180
And this national currency will lead

01:41:05.190 --> 01:41:07.400
to a relative price increase again

01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:10.860
- its prices for export goods.

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.500
And the last impact of world

01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:15.980
trade that I would like to point

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:18.360
your attention to is integration.

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.740
Integration is a positive

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:24.380
process, but it is related

01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:25.980
to two trends that we will

01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:30.260
talk about a little later.

01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:32.880
The consequences are related to the

01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:34.880
fact that, on the one hand, integration

01:41:34.890 --> 01:41:37.500
unions liberalize foreign trade

01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:40.000
between member countries, but on

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:41.820
the other hand, the development

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:43.740
of an external single tariff

01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:46.060
can reduce trade flows

01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:48.220
with third countries.

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.080
This will have negative

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.020
consequences for world trade.

01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:54.420
However, the more integration

01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:56.280
alliances develop, the more countries

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.980
are involved in such integration

01:41:57.990 --> 01:42:00.640
alliances, the more likely

01:42:00.650 --> 01:42:02.140
the effects are obtained by

01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:05.000
the countries that are involved.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:12.760
The next form of economic foreign

01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:14.880
trade relations is international

01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:17.100
credit relations.

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.980
First of all, credit relations in the more

01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:26.320
ancient centuries, in the 16th and

01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:29.560
18th centuries, arose precisely because

01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:31.800
it was necessary to credit foreign

01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:33.960
trade, and therefore the first most

01:42:33.970 --> 01:42:36.040
important reason for the development

01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:38.360
of foreign trade is ultimately

01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:40.160
the development of international

01:42:40.170 --> 01:42:42.120
credit relations.

01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:45.580
The growth of the legal capital

01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:47.780
in the national economy eventually

01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:49.580
reaches such limits that it becomes

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.140
superfluous and does not find profitable

01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:53.280
spheres of application with

01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:56.140
the rate of profit that the owners

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.580
of this capital would like to

01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:59.320
obtain in the national

01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:00.960
economy, and then it goes beyond

01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:03.200
the national frameworks.

01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.700
And the next reason is the

01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:07.980
introduction of international calculations,

01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:10.660
interstate relations are meant.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.120
In this case, if we have a

01:43:13.130 --> 01:43:15.020
negative trade and a negative

01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:17.340
balance of payments, then it is

01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:20.220
just the credit relationships

01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:22.440
of both private and public

01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:23.660
creditors that help countries

01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:27.400
to balance their financial

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:29.560
system.

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.320
What are forms of credit?

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:34.920
First of all, you can consider

01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:36.620
forms of lending depending on

01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:39.100
what flows are associated with

01:43:39.110 --> 01:43:41.280
this lending, first of all forms

01:43:41.290 --> 01:43:43.140
of export lending.

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:46.460
This is, as shown in the scheme,

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.300
commercial and banking loan.

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.220
Commercial credit is associated

01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:51.840
with the activities of firms

01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:53.800
that trade and lend each other in

01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:56.520
these processes, and bank credit

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:58.500
is already a separate service

01:43:58.510 --> 01:44:00.840
of the banking sector for the purposes

01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:03.400
of trade.

01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:06.020
In this case, the forms of such

01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:07.360
loans will be consumer,

01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:08.840
forgive me, purchasing contributions,

01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:10.780
which are issued by the exporter,

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:12.880
or other parties of the foreign

01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:13.860
producer, courts for

01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:16.480
goods within the country,

01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:19.180
loans for goods, goods documents

01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:21.340
in the country of export and

01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:23.580
bank loans, again - also

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:26.800
for loans in the country

01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:28.560
of export.

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:31.860
The commercial or firm credit of the

01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:35.580
importer in this case is credited,

01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:37.420
first, the form of such credit is

01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:39.240
the credit on an open account, when

01:44:39.250 --> 01:44:41.220
the exporter records on the account

01:44:41.230 --> 01:44:42.960
of the importer as his debt the

01:44:42.970 --> 01:44:44.440
value of the sold and shipped

01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:46.480
goods, and the importer must repay

01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:48.220
the credit within the established

01:44:48.230 --> 01:44:49.620
timeframe.

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.680
Exporting credit: The exporter concludes

01:44:51.690 --> 01:44:53.680
a deal on the sale of goods in credit

01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:56.260
and makes claims to the importer

01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:59.260
about payment.

01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:02.020
Private insurance is in this case

01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:04.660
insurance of foreign trade relations

01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:07.360
by insurance companies and then the

01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:09.480
insurance company takes on the

01:45:09.490 --> 01:45:11.160
risks of payment.

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.760
The state guarantees, this sphere

01:45:13.770 --> 01:45:17.280
has developed rapidly in the last

01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:20.860
20 years and all the most developed

01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:22.860
countries in the world

01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:25.080
have state support for

01:45:25.090 --> 01:45:27.300
stimulating their exports and

01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:28.940
then the state insures not

01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:30.780
only economic but also political

01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:34.300
risks that can damage the

01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:38.300
foreign trade flow.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:41.300
What is the structure of the

01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:43.100
import bank loan?

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.440
First of all, it is a loan issued

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.140
with the consent of the importer

01:45:48.150 --> 01:45:49.820
bank to pay for the exporting demand,

01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:51.380
that is, a loan issued

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:52.740
at the acceptance.

01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:55.060
The next form is a rambourse

01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:56.180
loan.

01:45:56.190 --> 01:45:58.760
In this case, the bill is accepted

01:45:58.770 --> 01:46:00.680
by the bank on condition of

01:46:00.690 --> 01:46:03.120
receiving a guarantee on it from

01:46:03.130 --> 01:46:05.960
the foreign bank - the importer.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.380
The next form is direct

01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:08.700
banking loan to

01:46:08.710 --> 01:46:10.180
foreign buyers.

01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:13.720
It is interesting to develop

01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:16.280
credit lines when large banks

01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:18.720
open credit lines for foreign

01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:21.020
trade needs to their regular

01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:23.820
customers in export-import

01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:26.380
relationships.

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.480
This is a situation where payments

01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:30.860
are almost instantaneous.

01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:32.140
The factoring.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.140
In this case, the exporter

01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:36.680
who sold the goods on credit

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.980
terms receives from the factoring

01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:40.680
company a number of services

01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:42.400
in the form of debt recovery,

01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:44.300
accounting for export

01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:47.320
claims and payment control.

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:48.020
The leasing.

01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.080
The transfer of legal ownership

01:46:54.670 --> 01:46:58.440
to consumers of transactions continues

01:46:58.450 --> 01:46:59.880
gradually, then paying lease

01:46:59.890 --> 01:47:02.120
payments, the buyer is not

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.440
obliged to immediately buy equipment,

01:47:04.450 --> 01:47:07.060
thereby obtaining a deferred

01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:08.620
payment.

01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.160
Compensation transactions.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.980
This form of lending is

01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:15.680
also quite successful between

01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:18.280
stable partners, especially

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:20.000
partners that are linked

01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:21.960
to contracts on raw

01:47:21.970 --> 01:47:23.140
materials.

01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:26.200
That is, it is assumed that the

01:47:26.210 --> 01:47:29.420
supplier of raw materials and components

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:32.780
supplies products in credit, and that

01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:34.940
the firm in another country that imports

01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:36.860
this raw material and components,

01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:39.940
it is further paid for the share

01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:42.660
of finished products on the supply

01:47:42.670 --> 01:47:46.780
of raw materials and components.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:52.080
Insurance of multinational contracts.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.520
Of course, such contracts are connected

01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:56.960
with transnational corporations

01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:59.140
and are insured primarily by

01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:02.200
transnational banks and national

01:48:02.210 --> 01:48:03.120
state companies,

01:48:03.130 --> 01:48:04.560
because the volume of turnover

01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:07.420
is quite large, as

01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:11.600
are the volumes of risk.

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.600
Thus, international credit,

01:48:13.610 --> 01:48:15.580
as we see, is divided into

01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:17.100
three subgroups – private,

01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:19.340
public and private-state.

01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:24.240
If we still have a country credit,

01:48:24.250 --> 01:48:26.060
there is an interstate loan, it

01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:28.540
is assumed that the loan is issued

01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:30.560
by one government to another.

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.600
What funds are used for

01:48:32.610 --> 01:48:33.740
such loans?

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.340
This is the state budget funds,

01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:37.560
or the funds of specialized

01:48:37.570 --> 01:48:39.340
state or semi-state banks, such as,

01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:41.380
for example, the foreign-turbine

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.160
bank or the sberbank for the

01:48:44.170 --> 01:48:45.900
Russian Federation, that

01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:47.220
is, in addition to the

01:48:47.230 --> 01:48:48.320
Central Bank.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.040
When interstate lending

01:48:50.050 --> 01:48:51.800
is carried out, it is assumed that

01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:53.720
all countries in the world are interested

01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:56.300
in the absence of destabilization

01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:58.300
of the financial market and the

01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:59.740
financial system.

01:48:59.750 --> 01:49:02.400
And so it is more important for

01:49:02.410 --> 01:49:04.060
them to avoid economic catastrophes

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:06.080
in one country or another, because

01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:07.760
this country will offer to export

01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:10.000
some goods, as well as buy

01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:13.640
imports from developed or

01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:15.340
developing countries.

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:18.640
Accordingly, countries are

01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:21.520
interested in providing

01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:23.900
loans at the state level within

01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:24.900
the framework of international

01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:26.220
relations.

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.680
In this regard, the table

01:49:28.690 --> 01:49:30.300
presented on the following slide

01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:33.220
is the structure of the Russian

01:49:33.230 --> 01:49:34.900
Federation’s external debt.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.540
As you can see, the debt of the

01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:43.830
former USSR is $56 billion.

01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:47.220
In comparison, I would say that somewhere

01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:49.880
10 years ago it was about 140 billion,

01:49:49.890 --> 01:49:51.920
that is, we are constantly paying off

01:49:51.930 --> 01:49:54.800
this debt according to a certain structure.

01:49:54.810 --> 01:49:55.420


01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.520
On the other hand, pay attention

01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:58.860
to the new Russian

01:49:58.870 --> 01:50:00.240
debt line.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.040
That is, it is assumed that the

01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:04.120
credit relations at the level of

01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:05.700
government loans are still beneficial,

01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:08.540
and beneficial not only to the central

01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:10.820
government, but especially to the

01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:13.520
regional level, well, for example,

01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.120
to such a level as Moscow, the

01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:18.640
subject of the Russian Federation.

01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:22.460
Accordingly, under some of their

01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:25.140
state programs, these government

01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:28.280
bodies take loans.

01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:32.540
In principle, as you can see,

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.300
the trends are such that on the

01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:38.300
one hand, the public loan has a

01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:40.760
tendency to decrease, but the private

01:50:40.770 --> 01:50:42.440
loan, that is, the loan from private

01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:45.000
banks, it has a tendency

01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:47.140
to increase.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.720
Moreover, private banks are

01:50:49.730 --> 01:50:52.020
borrowed by private banks in

01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:53.800
Russia or private companies

01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:54.600
in Russia.

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.680
The general trend is that the

01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:00.000
structure of foreign debt is

01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:02.760
transformed from the

01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:03.840
state, government

01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:06.260
external debt to the private

01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:08.400
external debt of the Russian

01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:09.680
Federation.

01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:14.500
In this regard, countries that

01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:17.060
provide loans to the world market

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:20.300
and at the same time take loans on the

01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:22.440
same world market are interested in

01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:24.920
coordinating their positions and in

01:51:24.930 --> 01:51:29.900
developing common requirements and

01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:33.280
schemes for repayment of the loan.

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:36.340
In this regard, the Paris Club stands out,

01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:38.860
in this case it is an intergovernmental

01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:40.840
institution that is part of more

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:43.680
than 20 leading countries in the

01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:44.400
world.

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:48.320
It was created in 1956 and the

01:51:48.330 --> 01:51:51.040
club’s task was and is now to

01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:53.040
restructure bilateral

01:51:53.050 --> 01:51:54.460
government debt, so to

01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:56.600
speak, mutual flows are taken

01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:58.940
into account.

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.500
Russia has been a member of the

01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:07.040
club since 1997, because we are

01:52:07.050 --> 01:52:09.160
not only debtors and have been

01:52:09.170 --> 01:52:10.680
substantial enough for a certain

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:13.000
period of time, but also creditors.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:17.180
The London Club is a club of private

01:52:17.190 --> 01:52:20.380
creditors of developed countries and

01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:22.640
was created again to restructure

01:52:22.650 --> 01:52:24.380
the debt of developing countries.

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:28.100
Developed countries, by placing

01:52:28.110 --> 01:52:30.200
securities in the open market,

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:34.720
offer free purchase not only

01:52:34.730 --> 01:52:37.400
at the expense of state

01:52:37.410 --> 01:52:39.160
banks, but also private.

01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.880
This leads to debts to private

01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:44.100
creditors.

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:48.140
And in this case, the London Club,

01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:50.700
in terms of the relations to it

01:52:50.710 --> 01:52:52.360
of those countries that are

01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:54.880
debtors, it is a more rigorous

01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:55.960
organization.

01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:56.280
Why is?

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.780
Because if, for example,

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.340
a government lender who is part

01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:02.600
of the Paris Club can agree

01:53:02.610 --> 01:53:04.240
to a debt restructuring,

01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:07.820
roughly speaking, wait or get

01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:09.620
lower interest there.

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.760
It is because supranational

01:53:11.770 --> 01:53:13.160
interests, the stabilization

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:15.000
of political, not only economic

01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:17.000
interests, can affect the

01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:18.900
adoption of deprivation.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.600
But the members of the London Club,

01:53:21.610 --> 01:53:23.680
they bought these securities and

01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:26.140
borrowed these countries, the debtors,

01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:28.220
to get some profit, interest on

01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:30.440
their prices of securities.

01:53:30.450 --> 01:53:35.780
And usually they are less

01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:37.920
happy to agree to restructuring

01:53:37.930 --> 01:53:39.260
the foreign debt of either

01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:43.540
country if it reduces its solvency.

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.380
Just the rise in the rating of

01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:49.040
the Russian economy, according to the

01:53:49.050 --> 01:53:52.000
estimates of international rating companies,

01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:55.560
has risen to the level of B +, due

01:53:55.570 --> 01:53:59.640
to the fact that we have been able

01:53:59.650 --> 01:54:02.620
to repay our debts recently in time

01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:04.360
and fully repay the debt to

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:06.140
the London club.

01:54:06.150 --> 01:54:09.680
From this, the trend is, so

01:54:09.690 --> 01:54:11.600
to speak, the old debt.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.360
New debts, of course, as you saw

01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:15.620
in the previous scheme, it is possible

01:54:15.630 --> 01:54:18.160
that they are organized, because

01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.360
credit is just an important

01:54:20.370 --> 01:54:23.240
component of doing business.

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:24.680
The Tokyo Club.

01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.060
Not everyone has probably heard of such

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:28.960
an organization, but, nevertheless,

01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:30.460
it exists, it is the International

01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:32.180
Financial Debt Club.

01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:35.620
He is dealing with debt

01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:37.720
in the debt sector.

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.260
The Moscow Club was organized by

01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:41.360
the Government of the Russian

01:54:41.370 --> 01:54:44.000
Federation in 1998 to

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.080
settle relations related

01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:48.460
to the distribution of

01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:50.480
Russian short- and

01:54:50.490 --> 01:54:53.760
medium-range securities.

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.220
The next form of development

01:54:58.230 --> 01:54:59.580
of international economic relations

01:54:59.590 --> 01:55:01.560
is the loans of international

01:55:01.570 --> 01:55:03.220
organizations.

01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:05.300
The objectives of these organizations are

01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:07.180
slightly different from those of

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.440
loans that are represented, for example,

01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:09.760
by commercial banks.

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:10.280
Why is?

01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:13.500
Their main task is to stabilize

01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:14.900
the economic situation of

01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:16.380
developed countries.

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:19.200
And therefore, international organizations

01:55:19.210 --> 01:55:20.680
such as the International Monetary

01:55:20.690 --> 01:55:24.360
Fund and the World Bank, by

01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:27.380
the way, the World Bank and the

01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:29.080
IMF are the structure of the

01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:30.700
United Nations.

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:34.000
These structures are not

01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:35.780
intended to make a profit, so usually

01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:38.340
interest on these loans, although

01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:40.680
they are also required to

01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:42.500
pay, are quite low, and

01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:44.700
they provide long-term loans

01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:47.020
to finance economic programs

01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:49.960
and specific targeted projects.

01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:51.980
In particular, the last loan

01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:56.480
Russia receives in the near future

01:55:56.490 --> 01:55:58.640
is received by the World Bank,

01:55:58.650 --> 01:56:00.500
a targeted program related

01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:02.620
to the development of research

01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:05.460
and the fight against

01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:07.060
AIDS.

01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:09.940
International regional banks are

01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:11.860
also, in general, organizations

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.880
that aim at the same

01:56:14.890 --> 01:56:17.500
goals as the IMF and the IMB.

01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:18.220


01:56:18.230 --> 01:56:20.300
These are European, Asian, African

01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.420
and Inter-American Development

01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:23.300
Banks.

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.420
They have the name of development banks.

01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:28.100
They support socio-economic

01:56:28.110 --> 01:56:30.680
projects across their

01:56:30.690 --> 01:56:32.300
continents.

01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:35.320
The development of international credit

01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:37.920
leads to such a situation that many

01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:40.300
countries eventually begin

01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:41.940
to live in debt.

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.080
Economists even have a term,

01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:45.120
and economists - internationalists

01:56:45.130 --> 01:56:47.980
as a debt economy.

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:50.060
But the situation, in general,

01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:52.140
for different countries is different.

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.720
On the one hand, the debt economy,

01:56:54.730 --> 01:56:56.800
for example, of the United States,

01:56:56.810 --> 01:57:01.940
it even got its name in the textbooks

01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:04.220
of international economics “Payment

01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:06.200
balance deficit without tears”,

01:57:06.210 --> 01:57:07.880
that is, debt without

01:57:07.890 --> 01:57:08.520
tears.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:10.240
Look at the scheme.

01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:13.660
The current US external debt in

01:57:13.670 --> 01:57:16.640
the first quarter of 2006 has already

01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:20.700
reached more than $10 trillion.

01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:24.740
But in this case, this has not been

01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:27.020
so dramatically affected by, for

01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:30.860
example, the fall of the US currency

01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:33.360
rate or some other macroeconomic indicators.

01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.640
India’s external debt, for

01:57:35.650 --> 01:57:37.120
comparison, is only

01:57:37.130 --> 01:57:38.220
$140 billion.

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.260
If you remember, I already named

01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:41.520
140 digits, it was once, for

01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:42.820
example, the amount of our

01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:44.860
Russian foreign debt on the

01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:45.720
USSR debt.

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:47.500
For us, this was a very heavy

01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:48.600
burden, because we need

01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:50.240
to pay not only the debt, but also

01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:51.540
interest on it.

01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:54.280
But the external debt of Ukraine,

01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:57.040
and it is not comparable

01:57:57.050 --> 01:57:58.980
to these indicators, is only

01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.880
$50 billion.

01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:02.580
But the pace and volume of Ukraine’s development

01:58:02.590 --> 01:58:06.780
are such that, without a doubt, further

01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:08.960
entering into international debt,

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.660
these debt obligations, can ultimately

01:58:10.670 --> 01:58:12.740
lead to Ukraine’s development.

01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:14.060


01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:17.660
Therefore, the idea of the debt economy

01:58:17.670 --> 01:58:21.620
is such that, of course, if you have

01:58:21.630 --> 01:58:24.160
a high enough economic potential

01:58:24.170 --> 01:58:26.420
in principle, and you have accumulated

01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:28.320
it, and you have the opportunity

01:58:28.330 --> 01:58:31.320
to develop your economy and pay

01:58:31.330 --> 01:58:33.240
off your debts in some medium

01:58:33.250 --> 01:58:36.840
term, then living in debt in

01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:38.420
some period of time is not so

01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:40.940
dangerous, and even for the budget.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.040
But if it is a transitional

01:58:43.050 --> 01:58:44.580
economy, or even more a developing

01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:47.540
country, and the world market

01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:48.840
situation is evolving, don’

01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:50.780
t give god, not in favor of the

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:52.940
export of this developing country,

01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:55.080
then the option of the debt economy

01:58:55.090 --> 01:58:56.220
is dangerous.

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.060
Remember 1998 financial crisis,

01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:03.120
which occurred then in Russia, was

01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:05.920
not only related to those operations,

01:59:05.930 --> 01:59:07.580
with securities, with pyramids,

01:59:07.590 --> 01:59:09.700
which conducted the Central

01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:11.800
Bank and, accordingly,

01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:13.440
commercial banks on GCO, Federal

01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:15.880
Law, on securities.

01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:17.920
And it was just related, including

01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:20.660
the fall in prices in the world

01:59:20.670 --> 01:59:22.960
market for those raw materials

01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:24.940
that Russia exports.

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:27.120
Namely, the fall, the sharp fall in steel

01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:29.460
prices, and the sharp fall in leaven

01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:30.280
prices.

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:33.340
In this case, our debt economy

01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:35.480
has not managed to cope,

01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:36.960
has not been able

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:39.900
to pay its debts and

01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:41.860
has had to carry out

01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:43.400
a long settlement procedure

01:59:43.410 --> 01:59:46.440
to eventually restructure

01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:48.280
Russian debt.

01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:51.220
As soon as oil and metal prices

01:59:51.230 --> 01:59:53.320
went up, Russia created

01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:55.960
favorable conditions for paying

01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:57.240
outward debt.

01:59:57.340 --> 01:59:59.360
Thus, a debt economy for a large

01:59:59.370 --> 02:00:02.180
developed country is indeed

02:00:02.190 --> 02:00:04.240
a deficit option without tears.

02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:06.940
Moreover, we must remember that

02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:10.500
the US dollar is such a currency

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:13.360
that is in the reserves of most

02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:15.040
countries in the world, that

02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:16.960
is, it enjoys international

02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:19.500
investment and banking demand.

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:23.440
Based on this, even the direct

02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:25.800
coverage of their debts by means

02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:28.180
of the inclusion of a printing machine

02:00:28.190 --> 02:00:30.480
in a certain period of time can be done

02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:33.200
without terrible consequences for

02:00:33.210 --> 02:00:35.100
the national economy, for the entire

02:00:35.110 --> 02:00:36.440
world community.

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:39.380
But, nevertheless, such a deficit

02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:42.160
also requires some management

02:00:42.170 --> 02:00:44.520
and thoughtful decisions.

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.880
An example is 1970, when the United

02:00:49.890 --> 02:00:52.420
States, for a decade from the

02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:54.740
1960s onwards, solved socio-

02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:56.420
economic problems again by

02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:58.620
using the same dollar machine.

02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:00.840
And ultimately, the accumulated

02:01:00.850 --> 02:01:04.400
euro-dollars in Europe plus the fall

02:01:04.410 --> 02:01:08.940
in the price of oil, led to the crisis

02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:10.820
of the British Woods system and

02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:13.660
the collapse of the US dollar and,

02:01:13.670 --> 02:01:15.680
accordingly, the crisis in

02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:17.300
this fairly large and

02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:18.460
resilient economy.

02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.440
But a stable and large economy, it

02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:23.060
comes out of such a terrible situation

02:01:23.070 --> 02:01:24.060
faster.

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:27.260
And if, for example, in the 70s the

02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:29.880
United States was in crisis, then

02:01:29.890 --> 02:01:32.160
literally during the 90s,

02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:33.720
this stable rate of economic

02:01:33.730 --> 02:01:36.060
growth of about 4% wasined for

02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:37.200
a long time.

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:39.000
That is, a large economy, of course,

02:01:39.010 --> 02:01:41.520
has more potential and, accordingly,

02:01:41.530 --> 02:01:44.780
living in debt and being such a

02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:49.220
deficit economy has more chances

02:01:49.230 --> 02:01:52.460
in a large developed country.

02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:54.220
Moreover, we would like to draw attention

02:01:54.230 --> 02:01:58.680
to the fact that large countries

02:01:58.690 --> 02:02:01.220
with highly developed economies

02:02:01.230 --> 02:02:04.200
usually have a high-income population,

02:02:04.210 --> 02:02:06.200
which has high domestic

02:02:06.210 --> 02:02:07.760
accumulations.

02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:09.820
They also create a certain

02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:12.460
financial reserve, when you

02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:14.180
can take the domestic debt of

02:02:14.190 --> 02:02:16.200
the country and thus pay off

02:02:16.210 --> 02:02:17.100
your debts.

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:19.020
If there is no such accumulation,

02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:22.940
take the example of Russia or, for example,

02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:24.240
you can even take the example

02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:27.340
of Japan from the late 1990s, when

02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.140
too large debts in the population

02:02:31.150 --> 02:02:33.940
on payments in credit were not covered

02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:35.680
by income, but were not associated

02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:38.140
with large savings on accounts.

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.360
This, of course, causes a financial

02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:42.480
crisis of the national economy.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.300
The next group of relations is related

02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:52.720
to such a form of international

02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:56.000
economic relations as capital export.

02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:01.520
What are the factors of capital export

02:03:01.530 --> 02:03:03.680
and why capital exports intensify?

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.200
If we take the pace of economic growth,

02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:07.660
then, as I said, the pace of foreign

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.440
trade is higher than the pace

02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:10.720
of economic growth.

02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:12.680
So, the rate of capital export is higher

02:03:12.690 --> 02:03:16.300
than the rate of foreign trade and higher

02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:18.300
than the rate of economic growth.

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:21.160
The first reason is the development

02:03:21.170 --> 02:03:23.200
of the global market.

02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:25.200
As far as capital exports take place

02:03:25.210 --> 02:03:27.100
in various forms, including in connection

02:03:27.110 --> 02:03:28.960
with the organization of foreign

02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:30.800
production, the unconditional

02:03:30.810 --> 02:03:32.280
development of the world market

02:03:32.290 --> 02:03:34.580
will contribute to capital exports.

02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:37.000
The concentration of capital

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:38.960
centralization in national economies

02:03:38.970 --> 02:03:42.300
leads to the fact that it does not

02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:44.240
find its worthy profitable

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:46.060
use in national territories,

02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:47.500
and again goes beyond the borders

02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:49.720
of the country.

02:03:49.730 --> 02:03:51.440
Accordingly, the overaccumulation

02:03:51.450 --> 02:03:53.880
of the capital of the industrialized

02:03:53.890 --> 02:03:55.760
countries, again, contributes

02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:57.700
to capital exports.

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:00.880
On the other hand, there

02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:02.720
is their interest in individual

02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:04.380
countries in the influx

02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:06.140
of foreign capital.

02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:07.560
So much because, if you remember,

02:04:07.570 --> 02:04:09.440
those most export-oriented developing

02:04:09.450 --> 02:04:13.140
countries are just interested

02:04:13.150 --> 02:04:14.640
in the influx of foreign

02:04:14.650 --> 02:04:16.360
capital and foreign

02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:17.600
technologies.

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:21.760
The next reason for capital exports

02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:22.720
is to overcome

02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:24.200
protectionist barriers.

02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.900
If we have a fairly strict system

02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:29.560
in the country for some type

02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:32.660
of product nomenclature, for some

02:04:32.670 --> 02:04:34.660
type of goods for import, how can

02:04:34.670 --> 02:04:37.540
you bypass this barrier, just

02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:39.760
organize the assembly on the

02:04:39.770 --> 02:04:41.840
territory of this country?

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:44.280
This is the process of capital export,

02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.300
the process of direct investment.

02:04:47.310 --> 02:04:49.500
Well, a bright example of this

02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:51.720
is the Russian automobile industry,

02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:55.140
when, despite the high vase barriers

02:04:55.150 --> 02:05:00.500
on tariffs on import of

02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:03.700
foreign brands, especially

02:05:03.710 --> 02:05:07.700
young supported, it is just limited.

02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:10.760
This tariff is removed by the fact

02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:12.840
that many Western firms organized assembly

02:05:12.850 --> 02:05:16.100
production on the basis of those

02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:18.100
machine-building automobile factories

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:20.500
that already existed in Russia.

02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:21.300


02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:25.400
The next reason for capital exports is

02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:27.140
that it is associated with the development

02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:29.620
of transnational corporations

02:05:29.630 --> 02:05:31.080
and transnational banks.

02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:32.980
Another factor is the military

02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:34.700
and political aspects.

02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:37.240
In principle, a country, including,

02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:39.480
for example, the United States,

02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.440
is organized by exporting capital,

02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:43.760
organizing economic assistance,

02:05:43.770 --> 02:05:45.940
or by means of its own transnational

02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:47.260
corporations, in essence,

02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:48.380
the matter spreads not only

02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:50.860
economic but also political influence.

02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:54.440
In this respect, the country is a donor,

02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:56.420
it is interested in exporting capital to

02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:57.500
other countries.

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:00.420
And the last factor – all countries

02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:02.260
of the world understand what

02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:04.220
military and political importance acquires

02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:06.720
the country that organizes its

02:06:06.730 --> 02:06:08.420
foreign production.

02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.700
These states, these governments,

02:06:11.710 --> 02:06:13.860
they are developing a whole system

02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:16.660
of measures for state

02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:18.440
support of both expert

02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:20.760
capital and imports.

02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:22.120
Accordingly, if a country

02:06:22.130 --> 02:06:24.160
is in a crisis situation and

02:06:24.170 --> 02:06:25.720
it needs assistance and development,

02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:26.840
it will be state support

02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:29.240
for foreign investment

02:06:29.250 --> 02:06:31.420
in its country.

02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:33.540
The main form of capital export

02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:38.920
is both investment and capital

02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:41.780
export in the form of court capital.

02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:45.940
The disadvantages of the exit of the court

02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:47.900
capital are due to the fact that it is invested

02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:49.180
in securities.

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:51.440
Accordingly, as soon as the situation

02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:54.680
in the stock market, in the securities

02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:56.360
market, changes, the owners

02:06:56.370 --> 02:06:58.800
of these securities immediately

02:06:58.810 --> 02:07:01.720
try to get rid of them when

02:07:01.730 --> 02:07:03.660
they are depreciated.

02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.780
And depending on how they play in

02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:08.640
the framework of their

02:07:08.650 --> 02:07:10.620
speculative attacks on the increase

02:07:10.630 --> 02:07:12.060
or decrease of the value of securities,

02:07:12.070 --> 02:07:15.920
the capital in the form of such

02:07:15.930 --> 02:07:18.260
capital, entered into securities,

02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:19.740
in portfolio investments,

02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:22.000
it is quite mobile, that

02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:23.240
is, it has almost absolute

02:07:23.250 --> 02:07:24.980
mobility, in which case there

02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:27.140
is a flow of these hot money

02:07:27.150 --> 02:07:28.880
from the country that had

02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:31.260
counted on investing in its

02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:32.060
economy.

02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:33.800
Therefore, of course, direct

02:07:33.810 --> 02:07:38.440
investment is less mobile and it

02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:40.360
is beneficial to the country,

02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:41.860
because firms that organize direct

02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:44.600
investment are forced to organize,

02:07:44.610 --> 02:07:46.060
to be responsible for the

02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:48.160
production process that they

02:07:48.170 --> 02:07:49.940
organized in this territory.

02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:52.820
So, to get out depending on the market

02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:54.900
situation and leave this country,

02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:59.220
they will need some investment in

02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:02.400
the form of direct investment.

02:08:02.410 --> 02:08:04.540
The only way such capital can

02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:06.160
go is to sell its factories, which

02:08:06.170 --> 02:08:07.640
they have already established in

02:08:07.650 --> 02:08:09.620
the territory of that foreign power.

02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:12.000
In general, it turns out that the

02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:13.980
result of their activities remains

02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:15.260
in the national economy.

02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:16.980
Therefore, all countries,

02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:18.740
when showing statistics

02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:20.240
of international investments,

02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:22.780
must distinguish foreign

02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:25.100
direct investment by line,

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.540
turn their changes.

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:32.260
Who are the subjects of capital export?

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.220
The main exporters are the

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:36.100
industrialized countries

02:08:36.110 --> 02:08:38.280
or the G7 countries.

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.520
The main importers are developing

02:08:40.530 --> 02:08:42.360
countries and countries

02:08:42.370 --> 02:08:44.960
with transitional economies.

02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:47.840
But, of course, since, as we have already

02:08:47.850 --> 02:08:51.340
said, investments can, for example,

02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:52.660
overcome some trade barriers and

02:08:52.670 --> 02:08:54.960
are connected with different

02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:56.560
interest groups in communication,

02:08:56.570 --> 02:08:59.000
then, of course, the importers

02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:01.160
of investments can also

02:09:01.170 --> 02:09:03.720
be developed countries.

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:05.620
In particular, the United States of

02:09:05.630 --> 02:09:07.560
America is the leading importer

02:09:07.570 --> 02:09:09.300
of foreign investment,

02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:10.840
namely direct investment.

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:14.180
And in this case, this situation is

02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:15.880
related to the background of

02:09:15.890 --> 02:09:17.540
their relations with Japan, that

02:09:17.550 --> 02:09:20.160
is, Japan, having received a restriction

02:09:20.170 --> 02:09:21.700
on the import of vehicle equipment

02:09:21.710 --> 02:09:25.560
in the United States, eventually

02:09:25.570 --> 02:09:28.740
overcame these barriers by organising

02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:30.120
assembly production in

02:09:30.130 --> 02:09:31.600
the United States, by buying

02:09:31.610 --> 02:09:33.760
a number of enterprises

02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:36.480
and firms large in the

02:09:36.490 --> 02:09:37.420
United States.

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:39.900
So the option of importing capital not

02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:41.580
only to developing countries,

02:09:41.590 --> 02:09:44.200
but to developed countries it is everywhere.

02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:49.000
Pay attention to the following slide.

02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:54.600
It shows that the share of the influx of private

02:09:54.610 --> 02:09:57.080
investment in the territory of developing

02:09:57.090 --> 02:09:59.040
countries is growing, that is, the share

02:09:59.050 --> 02:10:03.560
of developing countries is increasing not only

02:10:03.570 --> 02:10:05.420
within the framework of international

02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:08.460
trade, but also within the framework

02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:11.840
of the flow of private investment.

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:15.300
This is due to the fact that in

02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:17.420
order to become a factory of

02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:23.060
the world, any country that has decided

02:10:23.070 --> 02:10:24.980
to set its strategic goal of

02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:26.480
developing export-oriented production

02:10:26.490 --> 02:10:28.340
will attract investors

02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:29.860
to its country.

02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:32.600
And so these investments will go

02:10:32.610 --> 02:10:34.980
the country through these flows.

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:40.020
The next direction that characterizes

02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:43.180
one of the forms of international

02:10:43.190 --> 02:10:45.660
economic relations is

02:10:45.670 --> 02:10:47.500
the international migration

02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:49.620
of labor.

02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.920
As you can see, there are a number

02:10:51.930 --> 02:10:53.840
of terms here that define that migration

02:10:53.850 --> 02:10:55.040
is the entry of the fertile

02:10:55.050 --> 02:10:56.680
population, and migration

02:10:56.690 --> 02:10:59.760
is the exit of the fertile population.

02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:01.600
In all countries of the world, the migration

02:11:01.610 --> 02:11:04.080
balance is also counted, probably

02:11:04.090 --> 02:11:06.220
by analogy with the trade balance.

02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:07.860
This is the difference between

02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:11.940
the people who have come and leave.

02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:15.580
And the most painful part of international

02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:17.620
labour migration, let us

02:11:17.630 --> 02:11:19.660
say, is the IAEA leakage, since

02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:22.580
countries with a good education

02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:24.280
system with a rich state subsidy

02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:26.360
of this system, but who have not

02:11:26.370 --> 02:11:28.980
been able to provide adequate

02:11:28.990 --> 02:11:30.820
jobs to their workers, are forced

02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:33.200
to tolerate this economic migration

02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.620
when people leave, focusing

02:11:35.630 --> 02:11:38.580
on higher incomes and organizing

02:11:38.590 --> 02:11:41.760
their jobs that correspond

02:11:41.770 --> 02:11:44.400
to their qualifications to

02:11:44.410 --> 02:11:45.520
the developed

02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:47.640
countries or to the more

02:11:47.650 --> 02:11:49.080
developed countries

02:11:49.090 --> 02:11:50.400
of the world.

02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:53.380
In this case, not only are former

02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:55.220
socialist countries complaining about

02:11:55.230 --> 02:11:57.440
brain leakage, which have really

02:11:57.450 --> 02:11:59.160
experienced such a global outflow

02:11:59.170 --> 02:12:01.980
of literate highly qualified

02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:04.360
population and countries, but the

02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:07.880
brain leakage is also related

02:12:07.890 --> 02:12:11.420
to developed countries.

02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:15.480
When the U.S. and Canada were

02:12:15.490 --> 02:12:19.860
integrating more rapidly, all Canadian

02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:22.040
radio stations spoke of brain

02:12:22.050 --> 02:12:23.680
leakage from Canada, as

02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:26.620
the U.S. income level for similar

02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:28.480
specialties was much higher,

02:12:28.490 --> 02:12:30.640
or the same Israel.

02:12:30.650 --> 02:12:33.580
Again, the brain leak in the United States

02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:35.460
as a more economically acceptable

02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:39.500
territory for re-immigration

02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:42.020
is the return of migrants to

02:12:42.030 --> 02:12:43.240
their homeland.

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:45.560
Is there such a flow in reality?

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:47.540
Yes, in principle, not everyone

02:12:47.550 --> 02:12:51.500
adapts to the cultural environment, not

02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:53.940
the economic environment that exists

02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:57.200
in the country of departure.

02:12:57.220 --> 02:13:00.420
On the other hand, the growth

02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:05.380
of economic stability, the decrease

02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:08.020
in inflation, the growth of population

02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:10.200
incomes, leads to the fact

02:13:10.210 --> 02:13:12.920
that those immigrants who have not

02:13:12.930 --> 02:13:15.620
found an adequate location

02:13:15.630 --> 02:13:18.540
or adequate work abroad, they return

02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:20.540
to their homeland.

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:23.200
The cause of migration, first of all

02:13:23.210 --> 02:13:26.440
of the labour force, is the high mobility

02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:28.740
of the labour force in the country,

02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:30.640
that is, the mobility

02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:32.440
of the labour force.

02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:34.660
In this case, Russia is in some sense

02:13:34.670 --> 02:13:35.940
an exception, because there

02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:39.500
is a characteristic low internal

02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:41.600
mobility of the workforce, it

02:13:41.610 --> 02:13:43.460
may be due to the huge territories

02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:46.700
of Russia and the difficulty, let’

02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:48.340
s say, workers from the

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:50.200
Far East will now be able

02:13:50.210 --> 02:13:51.960
to come to work in the Central

02:13:51.970 --> 02:13:54.340
European part of Russia precisely

02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:57.940
because of the travel costs.

02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:01.300
Or the second reason, of course,

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:05.520
is, in principle, the national

02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:07.620
feature with low

02:14:07.630 --> 02:14:09.620
labour mobility.

02:14:09.630 --> 02:14:11.440
And in this case, this mobility

02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:12.820
can only be increased at the expense

02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:14.420
of government programs and thus somehow

02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:18.860
revitalized the change in the labour

02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:21.720
market at the expense of their

02:14:21.730 --> 02:14:23.320
own resources.

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:25.140
The mobility of

02:14:25.150 --> 02:14:27.540
the workforce is quite

02:14:27.550 --> 02:14:29.060
high.

02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:31.020
As you know, from the near

02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:32.860
abroad, primarily from the

02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:34.500
Asian region, a sufficient

02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:35.980
number of workers are

02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:37.260
moving to us.

02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:40.040
In this case, pay attention

02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:43.360
to the slide you are offered.

02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:46.340
Statistics show that we have flowers

02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:48.980
here replaced, and the

02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:51.700
natural population pain is

02:14:51.710 --> 02:14:53.980
substituted in essence at each

02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:55.380
particular stage by

02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:57.020
migration growth.

02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:58.940
But I want to draw your attention

02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:01.460
to the fact that if, for example,

02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:05.800
in 2000 or 2003, the migration

02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:10.360
increase replaced only 3-4% of

02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:13.380
the natural population, then in

02:15:13.390 --> 02:15:18.080
the current period there was

02:15:18.090 --> 02:15:19.260
just some sharp leap.

02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:21.400
In fact, the migration rate has

02:15:21.410 --> 02:15:23.900
increased by 32%.

02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:26.340
This is due to the legal

02:15:26.350 --> 02:15:29.040
basis for regulating the movement

02:15:29.050 --> 02:15:30.940
of labour.

02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:34.000
In particular, for example, in 2003-

02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:36.480
2004, when, as you can see, we

02:15:36.490 --> 02:15:38.180
have a minimum migration growth

02:15:38.190 --> 02:15:40.580
scheme, at this time there was

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:42.340
a tightening of the migration

02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:44.660
legislation and tightening

02:15:44.670 --> 02:15:46.960
of the requirements for migrants,

02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:48.600
requirements that

02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:50.620
extend, including, to the

02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:53.320
work of donors, because

02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.940
they must pay the corresponding

02:15:55.950 --> 02:15:58.640
migration taxes.

02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:01.820
But by 2007 this suddenly

02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:02.960
occurred.

02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:05.560
In this case, it can be considered

02:16:05.570 --> 02:16:08.000
to be a statistical error.

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:08.300
Why is?

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:10.380
Because finally, in this period of

02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:15.820
time – 2007 – 2006 – this is the period

02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:17.940
when the requirements for the registration

02:16:17.950 --> 02:16:18.900
of foreign labor force in

02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:20.780
the country have again been tightened,

02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:22.900
and this is the beginning of such

02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:25.100
purely administrative measures.

02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:27.780
Those workers who have already migrated

02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:29.380
in the same stream in the country,

02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:30.860
but they were not considered as migrants,

02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:32.780
we did not take them into account

02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:35.320
at all, they have now manifested themselves.

02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:37.060
Based on this, we find that it

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:40.640
is indeed 32% immigration growth

02:16:40.650 --> 02:16:44.500
from countries near abroad.

02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:51.900
If you look at the statistics of 2007,

02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:54.860
the number of migrants in Russia increased

02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:58.020
by 9.5% in January and April.

02:16:58.030 --> 02:17:00.100


02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:02.600
Moreover, the external migration

02:17:02.610 --> 02:17:06.700
growth of the population has increased

02:17:06.710 --> 02:17:09.320
by 50-400%, which confirms the

02:17:09.330 --> 02:17:11.420
words I said earlier that we

02:17:11.430 --> 02:17:13.220
have internal migration,

02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:14.320
it develops relatively

02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:16.640
stable and not so sharp as

02:17:16.650 --> 02:17:20.600
external migration of the population.

02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.920
The number of migrants decreased by 10.

02:17:23.930 --> 02:17:28.040
6%, and the number of migrants to the countries

02:17:28.050 --> 02:17:33.220
of far abroad decreased by 17.4%.

02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:35.020
In general, this, of course,

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:37.400
the latest data reflect

02:17:37.410 --> 02:17:40.120
a joyful positive trend, meaning

02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:43.880
that for certain segments of the

02:17:43.890 --> 02:17:46.720
population, either returning

02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:50.820
to the country from a distant abroad

02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:53.340
or current work at home

02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:56.620
is more attractive than going

02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:59.340
abroad with all the problems

02:17:59.350 --> 02:18:00.520
and consequences.

02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:04.320
On the other hand, the reason for this

02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:07.720
reduction in migration is again the

02:18:07.730 --> 02:18:10.240
counter-strengthening of the

02:18:10.250 --> 02:18:12.260
laws of the countries.

02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:16.600
In particular, take the examples of England,

02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:20.160
the United Kingdom, when it is precisely

02:18:20.170 --> 02:18:24.740
in connection with the fact that a number

02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:26.160
of former Eastern European

02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:27.240
socialist countries of the

02:18:27.250 --> 02:18:29.740
post-Soviet period have now entered

02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:32.200
the EU, I mean Poland, and the Baltic

02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:34.600
countries.

02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:44.960
This is beneficial for the income

02:18:44.970 --> 02:18:46.540
of Western Europe.

02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:48.180
In order to balance the

02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:50.480
flow of migrants, Western

02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:52.360
European countries

02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:55.760
are tightening their laws.

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:57.820
In this regard, the number

02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:59.260
of permits has been reduced, for

02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:00.920
example, again - for entering Russians

02:19:00.930 --> 02:19:03.240
to the UK or Germany.

02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:05.580
Based on this, as we see, the migration

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.660
increase is not only related to

02:19:07.670 --> 02:19:11.860
the wishes of the own migrants and

02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:13.640
with those reasons that are related

02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:15.300
to their subjective position, but

02:19:15.310 --> 02:19:18.360
migration is linked, and labour

02:19:18.370 --> 02:19:21.240
migration in particular, is linked

02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:23.900
to a large number of state

02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:26.600
regulation factors,

02:19:26.610 --> 02:19:28.800
when the national government

02:19:28.810 --> 02:19:30.480
tries to balance the national

02:19:30.490 --> 02:19:32.660
labour market and invite

02:19:32.670 --> 02:19:34.680
only those migrants

02:19:34.690 --> 02:19:36.600
that are desirable for the

02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:38.200
economic development

02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:40.400
of the country.

02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:43.960
In principle, the causes of labour

02:19:43.970 --> 02:19:46.020
migration could be divided into

02:19:46.030 --> 02:19:47.280
two large blocks.

02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:50.220
Economic reasons and other reasons.

02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:53.400
Economic reasons depend on fluctuations

02:19:53.410 --> 02:19:55.960
in demand and supply of labour.

02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:57.720
Demand for work from the private

02:19:57.730 --> 02:19:59.200
and public sector.

02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.740
It usually falls due to cyclical

02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:03.540
unemployment and a recession in the economy.

02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:05.120
In modern Russia, as you know,

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:07.540
there is several years in a row

02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:09.900
with a tremendous economic growth.

02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:12.340
about 6% of the gross domestic

02:20:12.350 --> 02:20:13.640
product.

02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:15.520
Based on this, cyclical

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:16.780
unemployment is decreasing

02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:20.060
and the number of jobs that

02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:22.700
potential migrants can

02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:25.380
occupy is growing.

02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:30.540
On the other hand, such a natural

02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:32.700
cause of fluctuations in the supply

02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:33.880
of labor is the demographic

02:20:33.890 --> 02:20:35.300
situation.

02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:38.440
As you know, not only Russia,

02:20:38.450 --> 02:20:39.600
or, rather, so to speak,

02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:42.800
the main, so to speak, region

02:20:42.810 --> 02:20:44.300
in which these trends have manifested,

02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:46.840
is Western Europe, and Russia

02:20:46.850 --> 02:20:48.640
here is no exception, is the

02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:50.880
ageing on the style.

02:20:51.460 --> 02:20:54.280
Given that we do not actually add

02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:56.780
the population, but there is a population

02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:59.180
disaster, this contributes to

02:20:59.190 --> 02:21:03.200
the fact that the government is

02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:05.600
thinking about how to attract

02:21:05.610 --> 02:21:07.980
the missing workforce to

02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:11.320
the territory of the country.

02:21:11.740 --> 02:21:14.120
The next reason for labor migration

02:21:14.130 --> 02:21:16.520
is the uneven accumulation of investment

02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:24.060
migration, that is, some

02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:25.800
areas may be more developed,

02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:28.100
others less developed economically,

02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:29.840
and with the international structure

02:21:29.850 --> 02:21:32.500
of distribution of job offerings

02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:34.800
due to different levels

02:21:34.810 --> 02:21:37.540
of development of the economies

02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:39.820
of different countries and different

02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:42.660
levels of development

02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:44.460
of both industry and services.

02:21:44.470 --> 02:21:45.720


02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:48.280
The next cause of labour migration

02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:50.660
is the emergence of structural

02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:54.500
unemployment in countries.

02:21:54.580 --> 02:21:56.520
What is meant here?

02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:58.560
Structural unemployment, I will remind, from

02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:00.560
the course of economic theory, is associated

02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:03.140
with the moral obsolescence of a number

02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:04.600
of professions.

02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:06.360
Accordingly, those regions

02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:07.760
that are mainly oriented

02:22:07.770 --> 02:22:09.740
to some type of activity,

02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:11.220
such as mining, coke,

02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:13.740
coal mining, often in a number

02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:19.000
of countries of the regions,

02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:21.820
it is in a state of a

02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:27.780
half-stricken process.

02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:29.720
On this basis, there is an accumulation

02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:31.860
of excess workforce, which must

02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:34.140
somewhere find its application.

02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:35.580
This is due to both domestic

02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:38.260
and international migration.

02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:40.980
And the last, often the most important

02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:42.860
factor that contributes to population

02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:44.520
migration, is the disparities between

02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:49.860
countries in the level associated with

02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:53.880
the inequality of development of countries

02:22:53.890 --> 02:22:55.080
as such.

02:22:56.460 --> 02:22:58.220
But the only thing that can be said

02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:59.840
here, and more precisely what needs

02:22:59.850 --> 02:23:02.480
to be noted, is that the same international

02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:03.920
trade, international investments,

02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:05.840
these processes, they lead

02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:09.440
to the fact that the level

02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:10.780
of wages between countries

02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:13.340
is gradually aligned.

02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:16.780
Based on this, of course, these

02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:18.680
processes are quite long, but based

02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:20.680
on this concept of the level

02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:22.740
of pay alignment, we can conclude

02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:25.940
that, probably, these processes

02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:27.720
can somehow be accelerated.

02:23:27.730 --> 02:23:28.380


02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:30.680
Based on this, in the framework

02:23:30.690 --> 02:23:32.800
of the debates that take place

02:23:32.810 --> 02:23:34.780
in the World Trade Organization,

02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:37.560
developed countries propose to introduce

02:23:37.570 --> 02:23:39.560
for the countries of export

02:23:39.570 --> 02:23:41.320
leaders, the leaders of exporters

02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:43.160
some international standards

02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:46.140
of wages, proving that in this

02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:48.660
case, this is, say, the situation

02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:52.160
of low wages, this situation

02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:53.720
is artificially, suppose,

02:23:53.730 --> 02:23:56.440
created in this country.

02:23:56.860 --> 02:23:58.560
And given that these countries

02:23:58.570 --> 02:23:59.980
receive high enough incomes,

02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:02.280
they could raise wages

02:24:02.290 --> 02:24:03.640
at the state level by

02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:05.560
means of government decisions.

02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:06.580


02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:10.620
But, nevertheless, the difference

02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:13.100
in the level of wages remains, and

02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:15.580
this is again the reason for the cross-

02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:19.340
country movement of labor resources.

02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:23.020
Other non-economic reasons

02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:24.660
that may arise are

02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:26.080
political.

02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:28.720
Population migration from areas

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:31.000
related to military actions, religious

02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:37.200
and ethnic In this case, within

02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:40.160
the course we are most interested

02:24:40.170 --> 02:24:42.700
in the reasons for economic

02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:45.020
migration, which we with

02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:47.020
you have stopped.

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:49.340
There are a number of factors

02:24:49.350 --> 02:24:52.740
that curb labour migration.

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:55.180
As you know, there is a fierce

02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:56.740
debate in Russia lately about

02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:59.680
whether to open borders

02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:02.160
so actively and invite the

02:25:02.170 --> 02:25:05.240
workforce to the Russian

02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:07.200
labor market.

02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:09.660
The deterrent factors in this

02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:13.640
case are living standards.

02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:16.320
That is, once an immigrant arrives

02:25:16.330 --> 02:25:19.340
in the country of destination, in

02:25:19.350 --> 02:25:21.620
the country of his dreams,

02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:23.540
it is assumed that he, as a

02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:25.420
citizen of the country, must be

02:25:25.430 --> 02:25:27.160
provided with the same social

02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:30.340
guarantees as all citizens.

02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:32.500
Even for that transitional period,

02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:35.340
until he has yet to become a citizen,

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:36.420
at least some minimum

02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:37.520
level of these standards

02:25:37.530 --> 02:25:38.780
of living.

02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:40.880
This is the cost of the country.

02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:44.240
Accordingly, on the one hand,

02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:45.940
the state must develop programs

02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:48.240
to maintain such living

02:25:48.250 --> 02:25:50.440
standards for migrants

02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:54.000
that the country is interested in.

02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:57.760
On the other hand, there is

02:25:57.770 --> 02:25:59.280
a contradiction here, related

02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:01.020
to the fact that certain financial

02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:03.400
resources need to be spent on this.

02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:05.160
Moreover, these financial resources

02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:07.000
are taken from their, so to speak,

02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:09.380
indigenous citizens, and are

02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:11.120
taken, respectively, from those

02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:12.860
programs that could create

02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:14.440
additional jobs for their

02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:18.140
citizens with higher pay.

02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:20.420
The next deterrent is already those

02:26:20.430 --> 02:26:21.520
immigration restrictions

02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:23.160
that the government of one

02:26:23.170 --> 02:26:25.680
country or another imposes.

02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.100
Especially the immigration taxes.

02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:31.360
According to the legislation of

02:26:31.370 --> 02:26:33.600
many countries, employers

02:26:33.610 --> 02:26:36.300
are obliged to pay a certain tax

02:26:36.310 --> 02:26:38.320
for a invited migrant, precisely

02:26:38.330 --> 02:26:41.000
because the wage of this migrant

02:26:41.010 --> 02:26:43.520
will likely be much lower than

02:26:43.530 --> 02:26:45.440
some standards that are

02:26:45.450 --> 02:26:46.600
already established

02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:47.880
in this country.

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:49.260
There is one moment here.

02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:51.220
In general, legislation usually

02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:52.500
establishes minimum

02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:54.520
hourly wages in countries.

02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:56.760
In terms of law, you cannot

02:26:56.770 --> 02:26:57.760
pay less.

02:26:57.860 --> 02:26:59.900
Accordingly, those employers

02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:01.460
who try to officially register

02:27:01.470 --> 02:27:03.180
workers, they will in this

02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:06.140
case go against the legislation.

02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:07.720
And therefore, here there

02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:10.140
is a tendency of the shadow

02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:13.400
labor market, when they try as

02:27:13.410 --> 02:27:15.200
in the post-socialist countries,

02:27:15.210 --> 02:27:17.160
and in the developed countries not

02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:19.640
to register migrants in order

02:27:19.650 --> 02:27:22.120
to be able to pay them wages much

02:27:22.130 --> 02:27:24.420
lower than those standards that

02:27:24.430 --> 02:27:28.780
are related to those specialties

02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:30.520
and with the level of pay

02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:32.400
that exists in the far-

02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:34.040
national economy.

02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:36.300
The last deterrent factor is

02:27:36.310 --> 02:27:37.480
the social-ethnic-religious

02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:38.760
problems.

02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:40.520
Again, in order to support

02:27:40.530 --> 02:27:42.780
social standards for this migrant

02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:45.660
population, on the one hand,

02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:47.120
this is important because if

02:27:47.130 --> 02:27:48.660
you invite such a labor force

02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:50.800
that will be your GDP potential

02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:52.500
to create, to perform some

02:27:52.510 --> 02:27:55.060
kind of activities that the indigenous

02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:56.440
population does not want

02:27:56.450 --> 02:27:58.940
to perform, then you must

02:27:58.950 --> 02:28:00.700
provide certain social

02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:01.740
guarantees.

02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:03.460
On the other hand, there are

02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:05.700
conflicts that are connected

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:08.680
with ethnic religious problems.

02:28:09.140 --> 02:28:10.780
And everyone has the events

02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:13.660
that took place in France in 2006,

02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:15.820
although it seems that France

02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:19.160
has adopted a very favourable

02:28:19.170 --> 02:28:21.100
political program to

02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:25.560
support migrants from the

02:28:25.570 --> 02:28:30.520
Asian and African regions.

02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:34.100
What forms of migration is proposed to distinguish

02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:37.480
the following forms of current resettlement.

02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:39.760
It is usually related to the fact

02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:41.580
that in one point or another of the

02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:42.900
earth or in one and the other

02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:44.480
point of some separately national

02:28:44.490 --> 02:28:46.460
economy industrial complexes are created,

02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:48.260
integration processes are taking

02:28:48.270 --> 02:28:49.680
place, and this leap of demand

02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:51.460
for labor force stimulates the

02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:53.200
arrival of this national, this

02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:57.900
labor force on this territory.

02:28:58.660 --> 02:28:59.940
The next form of migration,

02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:02.280
related to the following reason,

02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:03.320
is migration within the

02:29:03.330 --> 02:29:04.640
border zone.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.260
Of course, this form of migration

02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:10.980
is quite common and here not only

02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:12.240
European countries can serve as

02:29:12.250 --> 02:29:15.020
an example, but also Russia,

02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:17.900
when people go to work in border

02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:20.940
zones to a neighboring country.

02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:23.780
Agrarian migration is mainly related

02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:26.200
to the climate cycle, the cycle

02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:28.260
of the seasons.

02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:30.040
And then the arrival

02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:32.220
of agricultural workers is a normal

02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:34.300
practice, which is developed,

02:29:34.310 --> 02:29:37.200
including in Western European

02:29:37.210 --> 02:29:40.360
countries, which for

02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:42.180
a certain season offer

02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:43.940
to come agricultural workers.

02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.040
In this regard, agricultural migration

02:29:47.050 --> 02:29:49.040
is closely intertwined with seasonal

02:29:49.050 --> 02:29:51.260
migration, when not only agricultural

02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:52.900
works, but also construction works

02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:53.960
are carried out.

02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:57.160
We again in Russia have such types

02:29:57.170 --> 02:30:00.480
of migration, when, for example,

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:03.920
workers from Vietnam or China

02:30:03.930 --> 02:30:05.980
come to some of our agricultural

02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:08.940
firms for the hard work

02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:10.960
on growing, roasting, in

02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:13.460
general, cleaning vegetables.

02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:15.660
And seasonal migration on

02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:17.820
construction works, it is, in general, just

02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:20.400
in the eyes of all the Moscowis,

02:30:20.410 --> 02:30:22.680
the inhabitants of the cities.

02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:26.640
This area of work

02:30:26.650 --> 02:30:29.400
is very active.

02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:32.720
And most importantly, that the city

02:30:32.730 --> 02:30:35.780
governments, they agree to such migration.

02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:38.840
And the first thing that is established

02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:44.340
in the quota of invited people

02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:46.260
as workers on the territory

02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:48.280
of a given region is just the first

02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:49.340
line of construction

02:30:49.350 --> 02:30:51.140
work, then transport, then

02:30:51.150 --> 02:30:53.460
the cleaning of the territory,

02:30:53.470 --> 02:30:56.100
various types of work that

02:30:56.580 --> 02:30:59.140
may not attract local

02:30:59.150 --> 02:31:00.000
residents.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.500
The residents.

02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:04.360
What is the geography of migration?

02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:07.480
Of course, the point of attraction of

02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:10.260
migrants will be developed countries, such

02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:12.540
as the United States, Canada, Australia,

02:31:12.860 --> 02:31:15.040
the entire Western Europe, the Middle East.

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.500
These developing countries, it would

02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:18.920
seem, should not be the point

02:31:18.930 --> 02:31:20.800
of attraction of migrants, but given

02:31:20.860 --> 02:31:22.420
that a whole group of countries that

02:31:22.430 --> 02:31:23.720
are developing recently, which

02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:25.240
are called new industrialized countries,

02:31:25.250 --> 02:31:27.360
are all the same countries

02:31:27.370 --> 02:31:28.260
that are developing

02:31:28.270 --> 02:31:30.040
an export-oriented economy.

02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:32.800
These are the countries where the indigenous

02:31:32.810 --> 02:31:34.480
population gets the opportunity

02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:36.260
to get a higher salary, to

02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:37.580
move into these, so to speak,

02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:40.020
enclaves of industrial development.

02:31:40.180 --> 02:31:42.180
Of course, the income level in these

02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:43.920
countries is increasing compared to

02:31:43.930 --> 02:31:45.280
another group of developing countries,

02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:46.860
and then there is migration,

02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:48.460
in particular, for example, in Latin

02:31:48.470 --> 02:31:50.300
America there is migration

02:31:50.310 --> 02:31:52.740
to more developed countries, Argentina

02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:53.880
and Mexico.

02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:56.320
But in the industrialized countries, this

02:31:56.330 --> 02:31:58.380
is another point of application, South

02:31:58.390 --> 02:32:00.560
Korea, Malaysia.

02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:03.340
This is the same example

02:32:03.350 --> 02:32:05.440
in the case of export-

02:32:05.450 --> 02:32:07.600
oriented industries.

02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:09.740
The sources of migration, of course,

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:11.620
is the entire bloc of developing countries,

02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:16.620
and the main of which is Asia,

02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:17.740
the Asian region.

02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:19.940
And the source of migration, of course,

02:32:20.940 --> 02:32:25.440
is the block of post-socialist countries,

02:32:25.450 --> 02:32:29.580
because not in all of these countries

02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:31.600
the standard of living is

02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:33.800
high enough, and first of all migrating

02:32:33.810 --> 02:32:35.840
qualified personnel, and then these

02:32:36.100 --> 02:32:37.880
personnel, who in the conditions

02:32:37.890 --> 02:32:39.880
of high unemployment, could not

02:32:39.890 --> 02:32:43.840
find an application for their activities.

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:53.460
In countries when developing

02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:57.540
legislation, such a selective approach

02:32:57.550 --> 02:32:59.800
to immigrants is declared

02:32:59.810 --> 02:33:02.620
first of all.

02:33:03.080 --> 02:33:04.580
First of all, workers are selected

02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:06.140
for heavy, harmful and unskilled

02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:07.640
work, for low pay, which

02:33:07.650 --> 02:33:09.720
is unlikely to be agreed

02:33:09.730 --> 02:33:11.840
to or to a lesser extent

02:33:11.850 --> 02:33:13.880
agreed to by their own

02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:15.360
personnel.

02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:17.660
Specialists for new and

02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:20.040
promising industries, this is the

02:33:20.050 --> 02:33:22.320
same import brain, highly

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.400
specialized engineers, banking

02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:27.440
employees, of course, and those who

02:33:27.450 --> 02:33:29.720
migrate in this stream, they are

02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:31.980
interested in getting a more

02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:35.680
adequate habitat, a good place

02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:39.120
of work and high incomes.

02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:41.840
Also representatives of rare

02:33:41.850 --> 02:33:43.560
professions, for example,

02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:45.020
as diamond limiter or

02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:47.740
painting restorers, doctors,

02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:51.800
special musicists with a world-

02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:54.260
renowned name, artists, scientists,

02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:56.320
athletes, doctors, writers.

02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:59.320
In this case, of course, it cannot

02:33:59.330 --> 02:34:01.520
be said that this is entirely such

02:34:01.530 --> 02:34:05.220
a flow of migrants, associated

02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:07.900
with some economic preferences.

02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:08.180
Why is?

02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:10.340
Because often just specialists

02:34:10.350 --> 02:34:12.440
with a world name of this class

02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:14.960
are, as they call themselves,

02:34:14.970 --> 02:34:16.600
citizens of the world.

02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:19.580
And for them, territorial migration

02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:21.480
is a natural process, they carry

02:34:21.490 --> 02:34:28.120
their works for different territories,

02:34:28.130 --> 02:34:31.000
in different languages, for different

02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:32.060
consumers.

02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:34.760
The next group is big

02:34:34.770 --> 02:34:37.280
businessmen who invest,

02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:39.200
creating new jobs.

02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:42.640
And many countries have a

02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:45.380
program that offers to get

02:34:45.390 --> 02:34:47.240
a residence permit just

02:34:47.250 --> 02:34:48.180
if you invest certain

02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:50.060
funds in that country.

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:52.100
And so this program is probably

02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:55.260
not a program aimed at creating

02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:57.540
the supply in the labour

02:34:57.550 --> 02:35:00.580
market, but a program to

02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:02.860
stimulate investment

02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:05.700
in the region.

02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:09.260
The next aspect we need to consider

02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:12.980
is such a special type of international

02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:14.300
economic relations

02:35:14.310 --> 02:35:16.160
as integration.

02:35:16.460 --> 02:35:18.120
What are the main features of integration?

02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:19.780
After all, in principle, the processes

02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:21.640
of interconnection, the establishment of

02:35:21.650 --> 02:35:23.100
some economic relations are

02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:24.580
characteristic, as I have

02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:26.700
already told, were different epochs and

02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:28.100
different stages of economic development

02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:34.060
of countries in a special

02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:35.100
stage.

02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:38.220
He has some special traits.

02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:40.280
And this is the first specific

02:35:40.290 --> 02:35:42.440
feature that distinguishes integration

02:35:42.450 --> 02:35:44.600
from other processes of

02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:46.500
interaction, is

02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:47.920
interstate regulation of national

02:35:47.930 --> 02:35:50.100
economies.

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.540
The next feature of international

02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:54.520
integration, as a result of

02:35:54.530 --> 02:35:55.680
this regulation,

02:35:55.690 --> 02:35:57.040
should form a regional

02:35:57.050 --> 02:35:57.980
economic complex.

02:35:58.100 --> 02:35:59.420
That is, the countries agree

02:35:59.430 --> 02:36:00.480
that they will have some

02:36:00.490 --> 02:36:02.040
economic zones, and

02:36:02.050 --> 02:36:03.780
accordingly closer cooperative

02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:06.620
relations on this territory.

02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:08.600
On this basis, national barriers

02:36:08.610 --> 02:36:11.200
are removed not only in relation to

02:36:11.210 --> 02:36:12.940
the movement of goods and services,

02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:14.480
but also in relation to the

02:36:14.490 --> 02:36:16.800
movement of labour and capital.

02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:19.820
Accordingly, as a result of such

02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:21.200
a thunderstorming integration

02:36:21.210 --> 02:36:22.920
process, a single regional market

02:36:22.930 --> 02:36:24.660
must be created.

02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:29.820
And this is generally the principle

02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:30.900
of adequate efficiency

02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:32.820
of redistribution of all resources

02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:35.400
in this integration territory

02:36:35.410 --> 02:36:36.920
should provide such

02:36:36.930 --> 02:36:38.540
an energy effect.

02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:40.120
Effects of growth, productivity and

02:36:40.130 --> 02:36:41.900
standard of living.

02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:44.800
What are the forms of integration?

02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:47.440
In general, the forms of integration

02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:51.060
are related to the stages that

02:36:51.070 --> 02:36:53.920
are going through integration in

02:36:53.930 --> 02:36:55.260
one or another territory.

02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:57.940
Depending on the emergence of new

02:36:57.950 --> 02:37:01.640
integration agreements, these forms

02:37:01.650 --> 02:37:05.940
of integration develop and allow

02:37:05.950 --> 02:37:08.640
the possibility of unbinding

02:37:08.650 --> 02:37:11.140
the same regional territories,

02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:13.280
the same regional economy.

02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:15.060
First of all, preferential trade

02:37:15.070 --> 02:37:16.220
agreements.

02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:18.320
This is the first stage of the

02:37:18.330 --> 02:37:20.880
establishment of foreign trade relations.

02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:23.280
It is expected that a network

02:37:23.290 --> 02:37:28.380
of national tariffs and other

02:37:28.390 --> 02:37:30.860
restrictions with respect to third

02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:32.340
countries will beined.

02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:34.560
But with respect to countries that

02:37:34.570 --> 02:37:36.280
entered into this preferential

02:37:36.290 --> 02:37:37.820
trade agreement, it

02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:39.860
is assumed that the movement

02:37:39.870 --> 02:37:42.180
of goods will be free from

02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:43.060
any barriers.

02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:46.120
The next level of integration and

02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:48.200
the following forms, respectively,

02:37:48.210 --> 02:37:50.380
is the free trade zone.

02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:51.740
It is expected that all barriers

02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:53.580
to mutual trade will be completely

02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:55.160
removed.

02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:57.560
The Customs Union.

02:37:57.580 --> 02:37:59.600
Moreover, when a free trade zone is

02:37:59.610 --> 02:38:01.380
created, I want to draw your attention to

02:38:01.390 --> 02:38:02.600
the fact that it is not only the

02:38:02.610 --> 02:38:04.140
movement of goods and services that is envisaged

02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:06.060
here, but the free movement of the

02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:08.360
factors of production, capital, that

02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:10.140
is, the labour force itself, the migration

02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:11.440
of the population.

02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:12.880
The Customs Union.

02:38:12.890 --> 02:38:15.200
It is assumed that the confidence

02:38:15.210 --> 02:38:16.940
of relations between countries will

02:38:16.950 --> 02:38:19.460
already reach the level when

02:38:19.470 --> 02:38:23.340
they not only give up some barriers

02:38:23.350 --> 02:38:25.440
in mutual relations and mutual

02:38:25.450 --> 02:38:27.520
trade, they at this stage even

02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:30.340
develop a single tariff, a

02:38:30.350 --> 02:38:33.480
single measure that limits or,

02:38:33.490 --> 02:38:34.480
so to speak, allows imports

02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:37.120
into their own integration

02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:39.520
territory, that is, a single

02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:42.840
tariff in relation to outsiders.

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:45.740
The last principle is the common market.

02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:49.500
There is the movement of production factors.

02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:51.020
It is assumed that all the

02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:52.780
previous stages I have already

02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:54.960
mentioned are part

02:38:54.970 --> 02:38:56.680
of the common market

02:38:56.690 --> 02:38:57.720
concept.

02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:01.360
The Economic Union is the

02:39:01.370 --> 02:39:03.420
highest level of integration

02:39:03.430 --> 02:39:05.080
development.

02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:07.420
This is an integration group.

02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:09.480
The main feature

02:39:09.490 --> 02:39:11.840
of this integration

02:39:11.850 --> 02:39:13.760
grouping is that there are

02:39:13.770 --> 02:39:16.360
not just such committees

02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:18.340
for regulating relations,

02:39:18.350 --> 02:39:19.460
but there is a supra-

02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.520
state government.

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:24.220
An example of such a union is the European

02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:25.220
Union.

02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:28.560
We all know that it has its own European

02:39:28.570 --> 02:39:30.720
Parliament and, accordingly,

02:39:30.730 --> 02:39:32.400
its own European government.

02:39:32.410 --> 02:39:33.900
This is why the level of integration

02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:35.400
here is already linked not only

02:39:35.410 --> 02:39:36.700
to economic but also to political

02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:38.220
integration.

02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:39.900
Of course, the economic union becomes

02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:42.140
more complete when a single monetary

02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:45.140
policy is even carried out and

02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:47.180
such a single monetary zone

02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:48.800
is created.

02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:51.860
What are the two main effects of integration?

02:39:53.060 --> 02:39:54.180
The first effect is the effect

02:39:54.190 --> 02:39:55.960
of creating trade or trade-enriching

02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:57.360
effect.

02:39:57.540 --> 02:39:58.960
It is assumed that within the

02:39:58.970 --> 02:40:03.440
framework of the customs

02:40:03.450 --> 02:40:06.540
union is just a situation that there

02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:08.660
are countries with production

02:40:08.670 --> 02:40:11.220
costs much lower than in the outsiders

02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:13.260
countries that did not enter

02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:15.100
this trade union.

02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.680
Thus, the member countries of the union

02:40:17.690 --> 02:40:21.460
are beginning to demand the products

02:40:21.470 --> 02:40:28.180
of their fellow members of the union.

02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:30.380
And accordingly, since they are

02:40:30.390 --> 02:40:31.940
not separated by customs barriers,

02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:36.220
it is possible for such a producer

02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:38.900
to produce more efficiently,

02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:41.100
to distribute resources

02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:43.280
more rationally and to produce

02:40:43.290 --> 02:40:45.040
goods for all of this

02:40:45.050 --> 02:40:46.960
integration union.

02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:49.020
The effect of trade deviation.

02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:51.140
It is a tremendous effect of integration.

02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:53.160
Usually it is due to the fact

02:40:53.170 --> 02:40:55.320
that just outside the union is the

02:40:55.330 --> 02:40:56.700
producer, whose costs are

02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:59.000
lower and more rationally organized

02:40:59.010 --> 02:41:00.540
production and the quality

02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:04.480
of products is higher.

02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:05.780
But these most integrative

02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:07.440
tariffs are beginning

02:41:07.450 --> 02:41:08.880
to act against it.

02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:10.280
And then all or part of

02:41:10.290 --> 02:41:12.560
the integration union countries

02:41:12.570 --> 02:41:15.200
are forced to refuse imports,

02:41:15.210 --> 02:41:18.000
although it would seem that

02:41:18.010 --> 02:41:20.380
the outsider country clearly has

02:41:20.390 --> 02:41:21.360
some economic advantages

02:41:21.370 --> 02:41:22.900
of its products.

02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:24.700
And then they are forced

02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:26.360
to switch to consumption and demand

02:41:26.370 --> 02:41:29.220
for those goods that are on the territory

02:41:29.230 --> 02:41:30.780
of the trade union.

02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:32.520
This effect is called a trade-

02:41:32.530 --> 02:41:33.800
distracting effect.

02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:35.800
In principle, the scale

02:41:35.810 --> 02:41:37.600
of such trade can be reduced,

02:41:37.610 --> 02:41:39.500
because, of course, by

02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:41.680
some parameters this product

02:41:41.690 --> 02:41:44.020
is less quality or

02:41:44.030 --> 02:41:46.220
more expensive,

02:41:48.090 --> 02:41:49.980
it is not fully

02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:51.560
satisfying.

02:41:51.570 --> 02:41:54.060
In principle, they are enough.

02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:55.800
It could be listed

02:41:55.810 --> 02:41:57.660
by regions.

02:41:57.700 --> 02:41:59.500
Africa has its own alliances, America

02:41:59.510 --> 02:42:00.220
has its own.

02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:04.020
On the territory of each continent, in

02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:05.900
each region, there is some kind of integration

02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:07.500
alliance, because countries understand

02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:09.080
the advantages of integration,

02:42:09.090 --> 02:42:11.760
which we have already talked about.

02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:16.840
This is an opportunity to increase

02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:18.760
integration and cooperation solutions,

02:42:18.770 --> 02:42:22.160
to develop, for example, the same

02:42:22.170 --> 02:42:23.940
transfer of technology or to equip

02:42:23.950 --> 02:42:25.720
their workforce in the territory

02:42:25.730 --> 02:42:27.320
of another country,

02:42:27.340 --> 02:42:29.020
excess workforce, and so on.

02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:31.520
So, the most, so to speak, stable

02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:32.880
integration grouping, which

02:42:32.890 --> 02:42:34.440
has achieved the highest results

02:42:34.450 --> 02:42:36.580
so far among the countries of the

02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:37.820
world, is the European Economic

02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:41.660
Community, which in 1992 already

02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:46.240
included 15 countries of the world,

02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:49.540
and slowly it included countries

02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:52.600
of the post-Soviet space.

02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:55.660
But now the countries of the

02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:59.120
European Union are confused that they

02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:02.980
do not want to further expand the European

02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:05.920
Union and include all those

02:43:05.930 --> 02:43:07.620
who wish from the eurozone of

02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:09.480
the post-Soviet space, precisely because

02:43:09.490 --> 02:43:11.520
there are certain standards of

02:43:11.940 --> 02:43:13.520
living, a social guarantee that

02:43:16.970 --> 02:43:19.720
is guaranteed to all people who

02:43:19.730 --> 02:43:21.880
live on the territory

02:43:21.890 --> 02:43:24.080
of the European Economic Community.

02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:25.840
Accordingly, this requires budget

02:43:25.850 --> 02:43:28.560
flows and, in particular, a redistribution

02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:29.940
of budgetary funds, the general

02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:32.000
budgetary funds of the European

02:43:32.010 --> 02:43:34.640
Union in favor of such more

02:43:34.650 --> 02:43:37.000
backward economies.

02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:38.900
And since they already had experience

02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:41.000
working with more backward

02:43:41.010 --> 02:43:43.200
economies, take the territory of

02:43:43.210 --> 02:43:45.520
Portugal, there Greece.

02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:48.300
Accordingly, these territories,

02:43:48.310 --> 02:43:49.900
they are generally in debt

02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:51.920
to the rest of the EU.

02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:53.420
They have their problems there.

02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:56.220
That, in general, to accumulate problems

02:43:56.230 --> 02:43:59.600
for the economy of the European Union,

02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:01.920
of course, the government of these

02:44:01.930 --> 02:44:04.560
countries, members, in general, so far

02:44:04.570 --> 02:44:05.420
do not want.

02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:07.020
They want all of these

02:44:07.030 --> 02:44:09.260
countries to such an acceptable

02:44:09.270 --> 02:44:10.580
level of development,

02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:12.380
so that they enter the European

02:44:12.390 --> 02:44:14.360
Union as equal members,

02:44:14.370 --> 02:44:16.220
not as a donor country.

02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:20.040
The next quite developed form of

02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:22.640
integration is the association

02:44:22.650 --> 02:44:25.640
of Southeast Asian or Asian states.

02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:27.640
10 countries are involved.

02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:31.320
The main distinctive feature of this

02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:37.020
group of countries is that it is an

02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:38.960
integration union, organized

02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:41.120
on the principles of openness.

02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:43.820
That is, everyone who wants to enter from the

02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:46.760
countries of East Asia and recognize the principles

02:44:46.770 --> 02:44:50.500
of the Asian, contribute to the fulfillment

02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:51.960
of the purpose and objectives of this

02:44:51.970 --> 02:44:57.040
integration union.

02:44:57.240 --> 02:44:58.840
He does not have such a

02:44:58.850 --> 02:45:01.080
tight closed type.

02:45:01.090 --> 02:45:03.140
As you can see, this integration

02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:08.820
union includes first and foremost

02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:10.760
the countries of the first and

02:45:10.770 --> 02:45:12.500
second waves of industrialization,

02:45:12.510 --> 02:45:14.360
the most export-oriented economies.

02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:17.420
These are Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand.

02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:21.520
In general, of course, there is also a group

02:45:21.530 --> 02:45:23.260
of ministers, so to speak, of developed

02:45:23.460 --> 02:45:26.600
countries, such as Vietnam, such as Cambodia.

02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:29.040
However, the trend here

02:45:29.050 --> 02:45:31.960
is that stronger countries

02:45:31.970 --> 02:45:35.080
help the less strong countries

02:45:35.090 --> 02:45:37.060
to integrate.

02:45:37.860 --> 02:45:38.860
and Mercasure.

02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:41.400
It is a common market of the countries

02:45:41.410 --> 02:45:43.000
of the southeastern region of Conos,

02:45:43.010 --> 02:45:44.960
created in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil,

02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:46.240
Paraguay and Uganda.

02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:51.180
In general, they are close enough

02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:54.380
to each other and, accordingly,

02:45:54.390 --> 02:45:55.740
they have traditional

02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:58.640
integration ties.

02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:01.240
The next example is NAFTA,

02:46:01.250 --> 02:46:02.660
the North American Free Trade

02:46:02.670 --> 02:46:04.020
Association.

02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:05.460
In this case, the

02:46:05.470 --> 02:46:07.060
All-American Association includes

02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:09.180
the United States, Canada and Mexico,

02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:10.640
and it was organized in

02:46:10.650 --> 02:46:11.820
1992.

02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:15.200
This is precisely the variant

02:46:15.210 --> 02:46:18.160
of the integration union, when sufficiently

02:46:18.170 --> 02:46:22.020
developed countries entered, and

02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:23.920
even Mexico, although it is a developing

02:46:23.930 --> 02:46:25.740
country, but its level of development

02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:28.060
is not the lowest in relation

02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:29.760
to other developing

02:46:29.770 --> 02:46:31.100
countries.

02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:33.100
And here, industrial integration and cooperation

02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:35.560
are developing, and in principle,

02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:40.960
the pace and level of development

02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:44.040
of international trade between these

02:46:44.050 --> 02:46:45.380
countries is quite high.

02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:48.540
CIS - Commonwealth of Independent States.

02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.040
It was founded in 1991 and was

02:46:52.050 --> 02:46:53.440
included in one of the sovereign

02:46:53.450 --> 02:46:56.340
states of the post-Soviet space.

02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:58.300
Some of them have already been

02:46:58.310 --> 02:46:59.220
observers.

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:04.040
The objectives of the CIS are,

02:47:04.050 --> 02:47:07.140
of course, to restore those broken

02:47:07.620 --> 02:47:09.600
ties that once were sufficiently developed

02:47:09.610 --> 02:47:11.840
within the Soviet Union and to

02:47:11.850 --> 02:47:13.040
restore, naturally, economically

02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:15.200
effective ties between

02:47:15.210 --> 02:47:16.380
these countries.

02:47:16.420 --> 02:47:18.740
Because these are neighbors and countries

02:47:18.750 --> 02:47:20.060
that have traditionally been

02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:23.220
used to delivering to their

02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:25.520
territories or other goods related,

02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:26.680
so to speak, to historical

02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:28.240
traditions.

02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:32.710
The new Eurasian integration

02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:34.070
union.

02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:36.510
Russia, for example, pays special attention

02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:38.830
to it and is constantly participating

02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:44.050
in various summits of the

02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:45.410
Union.

02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:48.730
It was established on 10 October 2000.

02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:51.310
The recipient is the customs of the Union.

02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:53.850
In the context of the customs

02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:55.290
union, tariffs are not charged

02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:56.990
between the countries.

02:47:57.170 --> 02:47:59.150
Now the process is underway, when

02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:00.790
the same unified tariff is developed in

02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:02.550
relation to the outsiders of this Union,

02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:05.470
the issue of the currency and financial

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.430
field is regulated and the procedures

02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:11.830
for trade are simplified.

02:48:12.450 --> 02:48:13.910
As you can see, here really

02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:16.810
includes the country of Eurasian

02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:20.070
territorial location.

02:48:21.330 --> 02:48:22.510
And Russia is interested

02:48:22.590 --> 02:48:24.210
in membership in this Union, since

02:48:24.220 --> 02:48:28.710
it is assumed that these countries

02:48:29.270 --> 02:48:30.730
can simultaneously be part of some

02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:38.390
structures that will take into

02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:40.350
account the mutual interests of

02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:41.650
such a special location

02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:44.670
of the territory of these countries.

02:48:46.490 --> 02:48:49.750
The next feature and group of international

02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:52.850
relations is related to the existence

02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:54.290
and emergence of transnational

02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:55.810
corporations.

02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:57.950
The term transnationalization.

02:48:58.990 --> 02:49:00.650
In principle, a transnational

02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:02.890
corporation is such a large

02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:06.190
company that traditionally

02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:08.110
belongs to the capital of one

02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:09.030
country.

02:49:09.410 --> 02:49:11.790
Of course, it can, of course, sell its

02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:13.830
shares or bonds in the open market,

02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:16.390
then international capital is already

02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:19.130
included in this national capital

02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:21.770
by the sources of

02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:22.930
the organization.

02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:24.830
But, nevertheless, it usually has its

02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:27.070
headquarters in some of the developed

02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:29.150
countries, intersected with it

02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:31.370
by economic and political ties.

02:49:33.470 --> 02:49:35.310
And transnational corporations at

02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:36.990
the present stage exist in both

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.270
developed and developing countries.

02:49:39.310 --> 02:49:41.330
A multinational corporation.

02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:44.530
A multinational corporation is

02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:46.310
usually different from

02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:48.450
a transnational corporation not by

02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:50.730
the system of doing business, namely

02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:53.150
that the capital that lies in its

02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:55.130
foundation belongs to owners

02:49:55.430 --> 02:49:58.430
from a number of countries, and

02:49:58.440 --> 02:49:59.810
branches are located in both

02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:01.210
developed and developing countries,

02:50:01.630 --> 02:50:03.050
as well as in a transnational

02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:05.210
corporation.

02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:06.870
The form of transnational

02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:08.610
corporations in Russia from the

02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:10.010
point of view of legislation

02:50:10.020 --> 02:50:12.090
is financial-industrial groups,

02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:13.810
such as Gazprom.

02:50:14.610 --> 02:50:15.890
Russian transnational corporations

02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:18.090
often do not register

02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:19.590
as a financial-industrial group,

02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:20.990
which is associated with certain,

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.910
say, contradictions with

02:50:23.290 --> 02:50:24.570
the legislation

02:50:24.580 --> 02:50:26.670
that regulates the activities

02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:29.370
of financial-industrial

02:50:29.380 --> 02:50:30.930
groups.

02:50:31.770 --> 02:50:35.770
Nevertheless, this form of

02:50:35.780 --> 02:50:37.950
development of firms, such large

02:50:37.970 --> 02:50:40.050
firms, is beneficial to any state,

02:50:40.210 --> 02:50:41.750
as long as, developing its branch

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:45.090
network, this corporation represents

02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:48.130
the interests of the state

02:50:48.140 --> 02:50:49.730
abroad, creates a positive

02:50:49.850 --> 02:50:51.010
image of the state,

02:50:51.020 --> 02:50:52.130
and so on.

02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:53.490
All countries in the world

02:50:53.500 --> 02:50:54.610
support their multinational

02:50:54.620 --> 02:50:56.030
corporations.

02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:58.510
Well, if you remember that often

02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:00.370
transnational corporations,

02:51:00.380 --> 02:51:02.270
based on their huge business,

02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:03.930
are the bigger tax provider

02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:06.110
to the national budgets, then

02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:08.490
it is even more clear why national

02:51:09.350 --> 02:51:11.810
governments support their transnational

02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:13.530
corporations

02:51:13.540 --> 02:51:15.710
and try, so to speak,

02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:17.910
officials to lobby the interests

02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:20.530
that these transnational

02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:23.930
corporations pursue.

02:51:24.110 --> 02:51:25.210
The scope of transnational

02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:26.770
corporations in the world

02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:28.250
is quite large.

02:51:28.450 --> 02:51:29.770
And the numbers you see

02:51:29.780 --> 02:51:31.890
on the slide now have virtually

02:51:31.900 --> 02:51:33.470
not changed for twenty

02:51:33.810 --> 02:51:34.710
years.

02:51:35.530 --> 02:51:37.090
Indeed, they control about

02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:38.370
two-thirds of the world

02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:41.650
trade, half of industrial production.

02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:44.150
They employ about 10 percent

02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:53.230
of all 40 percent of the subsidiaries.

02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:56.070
It controls 80% of existing

02:51:56.080 --> 02:51:59.930
patents and licenses in the world.

02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.630
Know – how.

02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:03.190
That is, these are powerful structures,

02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:05.730
provided not only to a sufficient

02:52:05.740 --> 02:52:06.490
extent by qualified

02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:08.270
workforce, but also by advanced

02:52:08.290 --> 02:52:09.950
technologies.

02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:11.870
They may have not only in

02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:15.370
this case some industrial enterprises,

02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:17.630
but also scientific

02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:19.850
research institutes.

02:52:19.970 --> 02:52:23.970
Nearly 90 percent of foreign

02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:25.890
direct investment is also made

02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:27.030
by transnational corporations,

02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:29.130
which, as I have repeatedly

02:52:29.140 --> 02:52:30.770
said, are trying to overcome

02:52:30.780 --> 02:52:33.090
national trade barriers by

02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:35.170
organizing assembly production

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:37.590
or production of some

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:38.530
components in

02:52:38.540 --> 02:52:40.850
one country or another.

02:52:41.410 --> 02:52:43.590
Almost all commodity trade, up to

02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:46.150
90 percent of global trade, also

02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:48.750
relates to the activities

02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:50.730
of transnational corporations.

02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:53.090
The gross domestic product of some

02:52:53.100 --> 02:52:55.290
countries is linked or compared

02:52:55.300 --> 02:52:57.970
with the gross output of transnational

02:52:57.980 --> 02:52:59.590
corporations.

02:52:59.810 --> 02:53:02.210
Let us not go deeper into the problem

02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:03.470
of calculations, from the point

02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:04.770
of view of statistics this is

02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:06.030
a incorrect comparison, because

02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:07.690
these are multi-level indicators,

02:53:07.700 --> 02:53:10.690
but nevertheless we can imagine a sufficient

02:53:10.700 --> 02:53:12.710
list of these most transnational

02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:14.590
corporations, gross output,

02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:16.710
which is more than gross domestic

02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:19.430
product, a number of stable

02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:21.650
developed economies.

02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:24.470
Look at the growth rate of TNC.

02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:27.550
Despite the fact that this scheme does

02:53:27.560 --> 02:53:29.410
not provide the latest data, but it is

02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:31.390
still visible that the growth rate

02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:33.250
of TNK is constantly increasing.

02:53:33.370 --> 02:53:35.810
That is, this is a natural economic

02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:36.930
process of concentration,

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:38.430
centralization of capital

02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:40.810
and development of capital

02:53:40.820 --> 02:53:41.950
in this direction.

02:53:42.310 --> 02:53:43.130
Because a transnational

02:53:43.140 --> 02:53:44.890
corporation allows to

02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:46.430
accumulate economic resources

02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:47.830
and more efficiently

02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:49.290
redistribute them.

02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:52.970
If in 39 there were only 30 TNCs, and

02:53:53.130 --> 02:53:55.610
in 70 they became 7 thousand, then

02:53:55.870 --> 02:53:59.630
by 2004 there were already 4 thousand

02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:03.670
TNCs, with 830 thousand branches.

02:54:03.710 --> 02:54:07.090
As we can see, within these 830,000

02:54:07.100 --> 02:54:08.810
branches, these contractual ties,

02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:10.810
integration, cooperation,

02:54:11.570 --> 02:54:13.650
and integration relationships

02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:14.910
are supported.

02:54:15.250 --> 02:54:16.610
And accordingly, on the basis of

02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:18.290
such links, it is possible

02:54:18.300 --> 02:54:20.310
to apply modern technologies, in particular

02:54:20.610 --> 02:54:23.510
various technologies based on the

02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:26.630
Internet, to the application

02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:30.710
of various computer programs for

02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:32.050
business management and to

02:54:32.060 --> 02:54:34.210
track, for example, the same goods

02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:35.370
flows, the production

02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:38.170
flow from raw materials to the creation

02:54:38.180 --> 02:54:39.810
of finished products, even its

02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:41.270
implementation within such

02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:43.590
a transnational corporation

02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:44.750
online.

02:54:45.090 --> 02:54:47.050
That is, having practically

02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:48.970
powerful resources, such firms

02:54:48.980 --> 02:54:50.810
promote technical progress and

02:54:50.820 --> 02:54:52.810
create such a positive

02:54:57.450 --> 02:55:00.130
in transnational corporations,

02:55:00.140 --> 02:55:01.490
probably you can list a

02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:02.750
whole list of negative

02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:04.190
factors precisely because

02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:05.590
it is a monopoly.

02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:07.130
And like any monopoly,

02:55:07.370 --> 02:55:08.890
transnational corporations, even if

02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:10.510
it is not one in this industry,

02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:12.210
not one, so to speak, oligopoly,

02:55:12.290 --> 02:55:13.930
that is, there can be a dozen of them,

02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:15.670
but still, nevertheless, transnational

02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:18.130
corporations, they can use some

02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:19.750
monopoly approaches at

02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:22.010
the price of education, and then

02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:23.770
the prices of their products

02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:25.730
will be much higher than they

02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:28.090
could be in perfect competition

02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:30.350
or monopolistic competition.

02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:32.750
And another, so to speak,

02:55:32.890 --> 02:55:35.190
negative factor of TNK as a monopoly

02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:37.830
is that if a transnational corporation

02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:39.510
has already invested some funds

02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:41.590
in some programs, and suddenly, don’

02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:43.170
t give god, a parallel program has

02:55:43.730 --> 02:55:45.410
developed, then, in principle, it

02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:46.450
has the financial capacity

02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:48.050
to buy this program of activity,

02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:50.650
the program of creating a new product

02:55:50.660 --> 02:55:52.350
and put it on time, because for

02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:54.950
it in this case it is important

02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:56.790
not the principle of general human

02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:57.950
efficiency, but the principle

02:55:57.960 --> 02:56:00.690
of obtaining maximum profit from

02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:03.550
the already existing developments,

02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:05.150
which went, of course, the

02:56:05.170 --> 02:56:06.830
large funds that this

02:56:07.170 --> 02:56:08.410
transnational corporation

02:56:08.420 --> 02:56:09.990
carried out.

02:56:10.390 --> 02:56:13.390
Well, we don’t have to go far,

02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:14.610
so to say, for example,

02:56:14.620 --> 02:56:15.770
it’s the same Microsoft

02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:18.090
with its programs, although against

02:56:18.150 --> 02:56:22.610
these manufacturers constantly,

02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:23.870
so to speak, consumers

02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:25.570
arise and try to trigger

02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:27.130
some processes, share

02:56:27.210 --> 02:56:29.370
some pieces of this

02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:30.390
grand company.

02:56:30.570 --> 02:56:32.810
But, nevertheless, there is a monopoly

02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:37.250
here, and the process with

02:56:37.260 --> 02:56:38.490
the negative effects of

02:56:38.500 --> 02:56:40.150
this monopoly’s existence is also,

02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:41.290
in general, developing.

02:56:41.730 --> 02:56:45.310
If you look at another data on transnational

02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:48.090
corporations, then in 2005

02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:51.750
there were already 65,000

02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:54.470
TNCs controlling 850,000

02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:55.630
branches.

02:56:55.650 --> 02:56:58.190
And employed in these, so

02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:01.010
to speak, branches were 74 million people.

02:57:01.410 --> 02:57:02.610
Over 80% of the parent

02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:05.790
companies were in the industrialized

02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:08.050
countries, but as you

02:57:08.290 --> 02:57:09.950
can see, 20% were

02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:11.510
in the developing

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:12.730
countries.

02:57:13.550 --> 02:57:15.290
33% of

02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:16.890
the population.

02:57:16.970 --> 02:57:22.870
In developing around 20 and

02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:24.570
about 50 percent.

02:57:24.810 --> 02:57:25.970
In the former socialist countries,

02:57:25.980 --> 02:57:29.950
the parent companies account for

02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:32.710
approximately half the percentage

02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:34.390
and the affiliated companies

02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:36.170
for 17 percent.

02:57:38.650 --> 02:57:40.990
The next feature that is associated

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:42.730
with transnationalization is the organization

02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:43.930
of banks.

02:57:44.830 --> 02:57:48.870
In transnational banks or industrial

02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:50.230
corporations in the modern

02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:51.370
economy, this is quite

02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:52.310
conditional.

02:57:52.630 --> 02:57:52.690
Why is?

02:57:53.290 --> 02:57:54.550
Because the organizational

02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:56.130
structure of a transnational

02:57:56.140 --> 02:57:58.430
corporation is such that this

02:57:58.440 --> 02:57:59.730
corporation itself is a diversified

02:57:59.740 --> 02:58:01.570
group headed by a holding company

02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:02.890
that simply holds a package

02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:05.730
of shares of various types

02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:09.470
of firms, enterprises that relate

02:58:10.090 --> 02:58:11.530
to different types of

02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:12.310
activities.

02:58:12.590 --> 02:58:14.050
Therefore, a modern transnational,

02:58:14.230 --> 02:58:15.670
so to speak, company, banking

02:58:16.030 --> 02:58:17.890
or industrial can be included,

02:58:17.900 --> 02:58:19.970
necessarily includes a bank

02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:22.630
and industrial structures,

02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:24.510
raw materials structures, trade

02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:26.850
structures and everything

02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:27.730
else.

02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:29.630
Based on this, the conditional

02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:30.770
division in a transnational

02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:32.190
corporation is sufficient for

02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:33.330
banking and industrial.

02:58:33.370 --> 02:58:35.710
No banking corporation stands

02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:38.130
aside from industrial production.

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:40.690
It is closely related to some

02:58:40.700 --> 02:58:45.670
financial structures and, accordingly,

02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:49.790
to industrial structures.

02:58:50.290 --> 02:58:51.850
And an industrial transnational

02:58:51.860 --> 02:58:53.950
corporation simply contains

02:58:53.960 --> 02:58:54.830
some specialized

02:58:54.840 --> 02:58:55.910
banks.

02:58:55.930 --> 02:58:58.570
It is closely related to banking.

02:58:59.230 --> 02:59:02.290
Therefore, the idea that the main

02:59:02.300 --> 02:59:03.570
clients of banks are industrial

02:59:03.580 --> 02:59:06.150
trading companies is simply related

02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:08.050
to the fact that the process

02:59:08.060 --> 02:59:09.910
of creating such giants

02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:11.950
of transnational corporations

02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:14.790
holding type, it implies that

02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:16.030
at some stage of development

02:59:16.040 --> 02:59:17.670
these companies can

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:19.190
be called, mainly, for

02:59:19.370 --> 02:59:20.430
example, trade or

02:59:20.670 --> 02:59:22.950
predominantly industrial.

02:59:23.650 --> 02:59:25.830
In general, their development, of course,

02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:27.390
goes in the direction of such globalization,

02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:29.710
the creation of such manufacturing

02:59:29.720 --> 02:59:31.530
and trade financial giants.

02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:33.050
The next feature of international

02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:35.750
economic relations is

02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:38.010
interstate regulation.

02:59:38.490 --> 02:59:41.550
It is assumed that, of course, this

02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:44.310
is not a form of creating a world

02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:46.170
national government, although sometimes,

02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:47.610
so to speak, in publications,

02:59:47.620 --> 02:59:49.010
in journalistic articles,

02:59:49.020 --> 02:59:50.610
they even call this

02:59:50.620 --> 02:59:51.850
world government.

02:59:52.390 --> 02:59:54.650
At the present level of economic

02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:56.010
and political development,

02:59:56.020 --> 02:59:58.230
we can only talk about the

02:59:58.240 --> 03:00:01.470
creation of such groups that

03:00:01.480 --> 03:00:04.350
involve a permanent meeting,

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:06.290
an agreement on a

03:00:06.370 --> 03:00:07.510
permanent meeting of the

03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:09.730
ministers of finance, trade,

03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:11.490
economy, heads of governments

03:00:11.710 --> 03:00:14.690
of states.

03:00:14.790 --> 03:00:18.910
In this case, this is a variant of such

03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:22.370
interstate structures, for example,

03:00:23.330 --> 03:00:26.050
the organization of summits at the level

03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:28.690
of the G7, which includes the

03:00:28.700 --> 03:00:31.570
seven most developed countries, in

03:00:31.580 --> 03:00:34.190
particular the United States, Japan,

03:00:34.850 --> 03:00:38.250
Germany, France, England, Canada

03:00:38.290 --> 03:00:40.230
and Italy.

03:00:40.350 --> 03:00:42.910
And recently, due to the fact that Russia

03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:46.150
is not only a raw material additive

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:51.270
to the world, but in this

03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:53.190
connection an independent and

03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:55.750
global economy, it is part

03:00:55.760 --> 03:00:57.630
of this negotiation process

03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:01.130
and now there are already G8 summits.

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:04.350
Within the framework of these integration,

03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:06.370
so to speak, interstate meetings,

03:01:06.380 --> 03:01:10.610
the principles of a common financial

03:01:10.620 --> 03:01:12.750
strategy, foreign trade development,

03:01:13.050 --> 03:01:14.810
the relationship to various

03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:16.610
global, economic and non-economic

03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:18.710
processes, in particular, environmental

03:01:19.210 --> 03:01:21.070
protection, are developed.

03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:22.290


03:01:22.410 --> 03:01:23.630
Another form of such interstate

03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:25.390
regulation is, of course, those

03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:28.430
already supra-state bodies

03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:30.930
that exist within the framework

03:01:30.940 --> 03:01:32.750
of the integration grouping,

03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:35.110
which I have already mentioned.

03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:37.150
This is, for example, within the Union, the European

03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:41.970
Union, their elected even the institutions

03:01:41.980 --> 03:01:43.890
and the government of the European Union.

03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:48.530
Another direction of development

03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:51.130
of such negotiations,

03:01:51.610 --> 03:01:54.050
international relations, is an

03:01:54.060 --> 03:01:56.370
international organization, the

03:01:56.380 --> 03:01:59.070
purpose of which is to promote,

03:01:59.250 --> 03:02:00.490
develop international

03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:02.170
economic relations.

03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:06.250
And here the oldest structure,

03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:08.330
the International Monetary Fund,

03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:10.890
was created by the conference, it

03:02:16.110 --> 03:02:20.170
was the result of the fact that

03:02:20.180 --> 03:02:21.790
the United States of America

03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:24.490
was conducting a sufficiently extensive

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.030
investment program to rebuild

03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:30.390
Europe, as you know the Marshal’

03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:34.430
s plan, and certain links were

03:02:34.440 --> 03:02:37.390
drawn up to coordinate relations

03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:40.030
not only between the United

03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:47.710
States and some influence.

03:02:47.950 --> 03:02:48.930
Therefore, in the end,

03:02:49.190 --> 03:02:51.470
the International Monetary Fund

03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:52.830
has become a sufficiently

03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:54.570
active structure that tries

03:02:54.580 --> 03:02:55.750
to influence international

03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:57.530
economic relations.

03:02:58.870 --> 03:03:02.190
Furthermore, membership of the

03:03:02.650 --> 03:03:05.090
IMF implies that these

03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:06.990
strange members eventually

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:08.710
become members of the

03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:09.850
World Bank.

03:03:10.470 --> 03:03:13.810
Russia has been a member of the

03:03:13.820 --> 03:03:15.190
International Monetary Fund

03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:18.510
and the World Bank since 1992.

03:03:19.770 --> 03:03:20.830
The main purpose of the

03:03:21.030 --> 03:03:22.530
International Monetary Fund is,

03:03:22.650 --> 03:03:24.130
of course, socio-economic.

03:03:24.170 --> 03:03:26.490
It is assumed that the International

03:03:26.500 --> 03:03:28.670
Monetary Fund should not allow

03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:30.390
problems such as financial

03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:32.230
crises to help counter

03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:34.310
economic crises as

03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:35.570
a whole.

03:03:35.710 --> 03:03:38.430
The main goal is to balance economic

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.810
relations between countries

03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:41.370
so that the interests of one country

03:03:41.380 --> 03:03:43.830
do not get stuck and do not cause

03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:46.710
development or development

03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:50.070
along the spiral of the world

03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:51.390
economic, financial

03:03:51.490 --> 03:03:54.010
and structural crisis.

03:03:54.750 --> 03:03:55.790
The next international

03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:57.150
organization is the General

03:03:57.160 --> 03:03:59.430
Trade Tariff Agreement, which

03:03:59.670 --> 03:04:01.710
was transformed into the

03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:03.490
World Trade Organization in

03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:05.450
1995.

03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:08.650
The General Agreement on

03:04:08.660 --> 03:04:15.330
the United States, Japan in the

03:04:15.750 --> 03:04:18.830
post-war period to abandon those

03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:20.870
huge, practically prohibitive

03:04:20.890 --> 03:04:22.090
barriers, which were fitted

03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:25.210
national economies of Europe

03:04:25.220 --> 03:04:28.470
and a number of developed countries

03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:30.110
in the world.

03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:31.670
Gradually, through bilateral

03:04:31.680 --> 03:04:34.130
consultations and agreements,

03:04:34.140 --> 03:04:36.630
countries and members came to

03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:38.250
the conclusion that all

03:04:38.260 --> 03:04:40.350
trade restrictions should

03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:41.710
be reduced.

03:04:42.210 --> 03:04:45.210
When the World Trade Organization

03:04:45.220 --> 03:04:46.970
was established in the 95th year, its

03:04:46.980 --> 03:04:48.830
objectives expanded because they

03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:52.350
already concerned reducing barriers

03:04:52.360 --> 03:04:54.110
to international finance, and

03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:56.150
to international technology transfer

03:04:56.160 --> 03:04:59.950
and other economic relations.

03:05:01.410 --> 03:05:04.050
At present, the World Trade

03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:06.050
Organization already

03:05:06.060 --> 03:05:09.030
has 150 member countries.

03:05:10.270 --> 03:05:12.790
In particular, Russia is preparing

03:05:13.250 --> 03:05:16.370
for accession and has conducted for

03:05:16.380 --> 03:05:18.730
decades bilateral and multilateral

03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:20.330
negotiations to resolve all those

03:05:20.340 --> 03:05:23.730
issues that arise with those

03:05:23.740 --> 03:05:25.670
countries counterparties

03:05:25.680 --> 03:05:27.810
that are included in international

03:05:27.820 --> 03:05:29.010
economic relations in

03:05:29.020 --> 03:05:30.670
the world.

03:05:31.230 --> 03:05:33.870
And you understand, if 150 countries

03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:35.890
of the world, it was with 150

03:05:35.900 --> 03:05:37.590
countries that it was necessary

03:05:37.600 --> 03:05:39.750
to bring to negotiations and all remove

03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:44.770
those issues and problems that existed.

03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:48.830
The last issue, related to the

03:05:48.840 --> 03:05:49.890
development of international

03:05:49.900 --> 03:05:51.490
economic relations, is another

03:05:51.500 --> 03:05:52.530
form.

03:05:52.570 --> 03:05:54.530
International transfer of technology.

03:05:55.310 --> 03:05:57.170
The court deals with the licensing

03:05:57.180 --> 03:05:58.990
and patent relations.

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:00.610
And, of course, such licensing and

03:06:00.620 --> 03:06:02.050
patent relationships are primarily

03:06:02.060 --> 03:06:04.230
related to the corporate sector.

03:06:04.930 --> 03:06:07.230
Within the framework of the state,

03:06:07.240 --> 03:06:14.210
the form of international scientific and technical cooperation.

03:06:14.770 --> 03:06:15.950
Again, within the corporate

03:06:15.960 --> 03:06:17.470
and, above all, the public sector,

03:06:17.480 --> 03:06:18.950
there is an exchange of scientists

03:06:18.960 --> 03:06:21.590
to conclude an agreement

03:06:21.600 --> 03:06:23.190
between the Academy of

03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:24.870
Sciences and universities.

03:06:24.910 --> 03:06:28.170
That is, there is training of personnel

03:06:28.180 --> 03:06:29.970
and specialists, such an international

03:06:29.980 --> 03:06:31.950
exchange, within which transfer,

03:06:31.960 --> 03:06:34.690
international transfer of technology

03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:36.410
is also possible.

03:06:36.670 --> 03:06:38.830
Another form is franchising,

03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:42.190
which implies that within corporate

03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:44.690
structures a firm transfers

03:06:44.700 --> 03:06:47.510
the right to use or its

03:06:47.520 --> 03:06:48.610
technologies, or

03:06:48.620 --> 03:06:50.410
transfers, suppose,

03:06:50.420 --> 03:06:52.010
the right to its trademark.

03:06:52.020 --> 03:06:53.290


03:06:53.300 --> 03:06:56.490
At the same time, this right, or

03:06:56.500 --> 03:06:57.870
rather not only the right, as

03:06:57.880 --> 03:06:59.550
many requirements to support the business,

03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:02.130
such methods of management

03:07:02.140 --> 03:07:04.110
and marketing, as developed

03:07:04.120 --> 03:07:05.590
in this firm.

03:07:05.970 --> 03:07:07.190
Therefore, in this regard, it can also

03:07:07.200 --> 03:07:08.490
be considered that franchising in

03:07:08.500 --> 03:07:12.210
a certain way, although formally not

03:07:12.220 --> 03:07:14.570
considered a direct transfer of

03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:16.070
technologies, but to a certain extent, however,

03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:17.750
franchising also contributes

03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:22.430
to the international transfer of technologies.

03:07:23.230 --> 03:07:25.870
Why do countries try to limit

03:07:25.880 --> 03:07:27.630
technology transfer?

03:07:28.430 --> 03:07:29.550
First of all, it is the desire

03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:31.270
to maintain technological leadership.

03:07:31.850 --> 03:07:36.290
Any monopoly has two sides.

03:07:36.370 --> 03:07:37.970
On the one hand, yes, this country

03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:38.810
will be a technological

03:07:38.820 --> 03:07:40.670
leader for some time, and on

03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:42.410
the other hand, it means that

03:07:42.420 --> 03:07:44.730
its technologies will be obsolete

03:07:44.740 --> 03:07:46.350
over time and it will need to support

03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:47.970
its technological leadership,

03:07:48.310 --> 03:07:50.370
invest a sufficiently high level

03:07:50.380 --> 03:07:53.230
of investment in these industries

03:07:53.240 --> 03:07:55.090
or in research and development.

03:07:55.170 --> 03:07:55.850
That means that it will

03:07:55.860 --> 03:07:57.850
need to maintain its technological leadership.

03:07:58.190 --> 03:07:59.610
And it is not necessary that at some

03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:04.230
stage in the process of some

03:08:04.240 --> 03:08:07.290
technical research this country, the

03:08:07.390 --> 03:08:08.870
technological leader, receives

03:08:08.880 --> 03:08:11.510
only one preference and dividends.

03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:14.230
The next reason for limiting the

03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:15.470
transfer of technology is

03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:17.330
the aggravation of national security.

03:08:18.010 --> 03:08:20.530
The state is trying to limit

03:08:20.540 --> 03:08:27.130
the spread of military technology.

03:08:27.140 --> 03:08:28.810
First of all, the technologies

03:08:28.820 --> 03:08:32.870
associated with the spread

03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:34.810
of various means of mass destruction.

03:08:35.470 --> 03:08:37.110
On the other hand, there are

03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:39.730
a lot of dual-use goods within

03:08:39.740 --> 03:08:42.430
the framework of national security.

03:08:42.870 --> 03:08:44.110
And then these technological

03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:45.910
developments of the state

03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:47.570
are interested, first of all, to

03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:49.670
develop their economies and

03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:53.230
transfer from the military sector

03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:55.570
to the civil sector within their economy.

03:08:56.290 --> 03:08:58.590
The next reason is the terms of

03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:00.210
international agreements.

03:09:00.220 --> 03:09:03.350
I have already talked about the COCOM

03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:06.630
agreement between NATO member countries,

03:09:06.970 --> 03:09:08.290
which regulates the transfer

03:09:08.300 --> 03:09:11.650
of military technologies

03:09:11.660 --> 03:09:12.870
and dual-use technologies.

03:09:12.970 --> 03:09:16.670
Certainly, countries that have their

03:09:16.680 --> 03:09:17.870
own national laws

03:09:17.880 --> 03:09:19.770
restricting the transfer of their

03:09:19.780 --> 03:09:24.470
technologies to the international

03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:25.790
sphere.

03:09:26.010 --> 03:09:28.330
They are very closely following this moment.

03:09:28.610 --> 03:09:30.430
In particular, for example, the United

03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:33.910
States, when trying to prove the

03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:36.430
illegality of any firm in any country,

03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:39.970
the transfer of goods, the

03:09:39.980 --> 03:09:41.470
sale of goods, some products to

03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:43.550
some third country, prove that it

03:09:43.690 --> 03:09:44.610
was in the development of

03:09:44.620 --> 03:09:46.810
its products that American

03:09:46.820 --> 03:09:48.630
technologies were involved.

03:09:48.730 --> 03:09:50.270
And often the percentage of this participation

03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:52.350
can reach 10 -15 percent.

03:09:52.570 --> 03:09:55.090
That is, this is a small component,

03:09:55.210 --> 03:09:58.090
but the United States justifies

03:09:58.100 --> 03:09:59.810
the introduction of either

03:09:59.820 --> 03:10:01.050
economic sanctions or bans

03:10:01.060 --> 03:10:02.750
of some kind, for these firms or

03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:04.250
for the entire economy in general,

03:10:04.260 --> 03:10:06.990
which has allowed such a spread

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:10.830
of technology to those countries

03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:13.290
that, in the opinion of

03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:15.610
the United States, are

03:10:15.620 --> 03:10:17.410
politically unreliable.

03:10:19.420 --> 03:10:21.580
There are two mechanisms for regulating

03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:22.680
international technology

03:10:22.690 --> 03:10:23.700
transfer.

03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:25.460
Direct regulation is.

03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:27.020
Of course, these are bodies of export

03:10:27.030 --> 03:10:28.580
control, border, customs

03:10:28.620 --> 03:10:30.480
control and indirect control through

03:10:30.490 --> 03:10:35.020
the issuance of trade mark patents

03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:38.300
by the state, licenses for know-

03:10:38.310 --> 03:10:40.560
how, rendering of engineering

03:10:40.570 --> 03:10:44.420
services.

03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:48.580
Thus, in modern developed economies

03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:52.860
are trying to create an adequate

03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:57.880
mechanism for regulating the international

03:10:58.500 --> 03:11:01.340
transfer of technology, so that all

03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:06.180
the interests and contradictions

03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:08.600
that are associated with the international

03:11:08.610 --> 03:11:10.540
spread of technology, in the

03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:13.300
end, were resolved and did not

03:11:13.310 --> 03:11:16.160
inhibit economic growth and

03:11:16.170 --> 03:11:17.320
did not inhibit the

03:11:17.330 --> 03:11:19.640
spread of technical progress.

03:11:27.220 --> 03:11:28.880
The next topic we will discuss

03:11:28.890 --> 03:11:30.000
is the state regulation

03:11:30.010 --> 03:11:31.440
of foreign trade

03:11:31.450 --> 03:11:33.340
relations.

03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:37.160
First of all, let us pay attention

03:11:37.170 --> 03:11:40.360
to what are the objects

03:11:40.370 --> 03:11:42.040
of foreign trade regulation.

03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:44.620
In the narrow sense of the word,

03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:46.800
these are the flow of goods, exports,

03:11:46.980 --> 03:11:51.880
imports, undoubtedly the structure of

03:11:51.890 --> 03:11:54.660
exports and imports, the issues

03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:57.300
of trade balance of payments.

03:11:57.460 --> 03:11:59.940
However, in the broad sense of the

03:11:59.950 --> 03:12:03.160
word foreign trade relations concern

03:12:03.170 --> 03:12:06.120
financial relations, since for the sale

03:12:06.130 --> 03:12:08.240
of goods on export and import it is

03:12:08.250 --> 03:12:12.220
necessary to carry out some things are

03:12:12.230 --> 03:12:17.560
also the subject of our consideration,

03:12:17.570 --> 03:12:19.820
the balance of payments.

03:12:22.020 --> 03:12:24.020
Given that foreign economic agents

03:12:24.030 --> 03:12:26.680
pay taxes, the state budget, economic

03:12:27.060 --> 03:12:30.140
growth is also related to the

03:12:30.150 --> 03:12:32.760
development of foreign

03:12:32.770 --> 03:12:34.580
trade relations and is

03:12:34.590 --> 03:12:37.380
the object of foreign trade regulation.

03:12:38.660 --> 03:12:41.580
We must note that domestic

03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:43.080
and foreign

03:12:43.090 --> 03:12:44.880
policy are closely

03:12:44.890 --> 03:12:47.480
interrelated.

03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:50.540
Look at the slide.

03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:53.600
Fiscal policy itself can

03:12:53.610 --> 03:12:58.620
act as a factor of foreign

03:12:58.630 --> 03:13:00.120
trade regulation.

03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:02.180
If we raise domestic taxes,

03:13:02.190 --> 03:13:04.340
domestic goods start to

03:13:04.350 --> 03:13:06.260
cost more, and therefore

03:13:06.270 --> 03:13:11.560
they become foreign

03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:14.880
counterparties.

03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:17.820
Accordingly, a well-thought-out

03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:20.120
fiscal policy can replace measures

03:13:20.130 --> 03:13:22.300
of open protectionism

03:13:22.310 --> 03:13:24.920
when the state introduces quotas,

03:13:24.930 --> 03:13:28.480
tariffs and some other

03:13:28.490 --> 03:13:29.600
restrictions.

03:13:30.500 --> 03:13:33.800
Protectionism is

03:13:33.810 --> 03:13:36.520
taxation itself.

03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:40.560
And so-it is such a tariff policy

03:13:40.570 --> 03:13:43.260
involves fiscal goals, that is, supplementing

03:13:43.270 --> 03:13:45.220
the budget.

03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:47.780
On this basis, some developing

03:13:47.790 --> 03:13:50.520
countries have a policy of

03:13:50.530 --> 03:13:52.220
fairly tough protectionism

03:13:52.230 --> 03:13:54.900
precisely because they do not

03:13:54.910 --> 03:13:56.820
have other sources of budget

03:13:56.830 --> 03:13:59.720
refueling, or they are very limited.

03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:02.280
The next option is monetary

03:14:02.290 --> 03:14:03.780
policy.

03:14:04.040 --> 03:14:06.160
It can also be a substitute for

03:14:06.170 --> 03:14:08.600
open protectionism.

03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:10.840
Because monetary policy regulates

03:14:10.850 --> 03:14:13.820
the monetary mass in the

03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:14.700
economy.

03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:18.820
As you know, a rapidly growing

03:14:18.830 --> 03:14:21.040
money mass can cause inflation.

03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:23.720
This in turn will lead to a decrease

03:14:23.730 --> 03:14:25.320
in the exchange rate.

03:14:26.820 --> 03:14:29.000
It would seem that such a terrible

03:14:29.010 --> 03:14:31.820
internal situation as inflation and,

03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:33.880
in general, a decline in

03:14:33.890 --> 03:14:35.100
purchasing power, such as

03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:36.640
the ruble, will negatively

03:14:36.650 --> 03:14:38.400
affect consumers.

03:14:38.420 --> 03:14:40.380
But on the other hand, from the

03:14:40.390 --> 03:14:42.560
point of view of exports, such a

03:14:42.570 --> 03:14:44.720
credit-monetary policy is even preferable.

03:14:44.780 --> 03:14:45.160
Why is?

03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:48.440
Because the fall of the exchange

03:14:48.450 --> 03:14:50.440
rate will stimulate a relative

03:14:50.450 --> 03:14:52.680
depreciation of exports, and,

03:14:53.020 --> 03:14:55.060
accordingly, it will replace

03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:56.360
measures of open protectionism

03:14:56.370 --> 03:14:58.460
and support exports.

03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:01.020
Subjects of foreign trade regulation

03:15:01.030 --> 03:15:02.820
from the point of view of

03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:05.800
economists are the state, supra-

03:15:06.260 --> 03:15:09.380
state institutions and various

03:15:09.390 --> 03:15:11.580
international structures.

03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:14.420
From the point of view of law, the

03:15:14.430 --> 03:15:16.800
only subject of foreign trade relations

03:15:16.810 --> 03:15:18.440
is only the state, because

03:15:18.620 --> 03:15:22.940
all generally agreed international

03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:26.180
acts are ultimately rectified

03:15:26.190 --> 03:15:30.360
by the national based on this

03:15:30.370 --> 03:15:32.160
law, I repeat again, I

03:15:32.170 --> 03:15:34.080
assume that the only subject

03:15:34.090 --> 03:15:35.360
of foreign trade

03:15:35.370 --> 03:15:38.080
relations is the state.

03:15:38.380 --> 03:15:41.420
An example of this is Russia’

03:15:41.430 --> 03:15:43.480
s accession to the WTO.

03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:45.620
Before we become a final WTO

03:15:45.630 --> 03:15:49.760
member, Russia signs a lot of

03:15:49.770 --> 03:15:52.320
agreements with almost all

03:15:52.330 --> 03:15:56.540
150 WTO member countries on a

03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:58.660
bilateral basis and

03:15:58.670 --> 03:16:04.980
ratifies these agreements

03:16:04.990 --> 03:16:07.020
at the national state level.

03:16:08.980 --> 03:16:11.880
Foreign trade policy is a special

03:16:11.890 --> 03:16:15.840
area of economic relations and problems.

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.200
The foreign trade policy is

03:16:18.210 --> 03:16:19.520
quite complex.

03:16:19.740 --> 03:16:21.200
The main problem is that we need

03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:23.240
to break out such an economic

03:16:23.250 --> 03:16:24.940
policy that would satisfy different

03:16:24.950 --> 03:16:27.020
groups, layers of the population.

03:16:27.160 --> 03:16:28.000


03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:29.460
And here comes the question

03:16:29.470 --> 03:16:30.800
of economic efficiency

03:16:30.810 --> 03:16:32.220
and social justice.

03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:35.500
On the one hand, market, market relations,

03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:37.620
competition contribute

03:16:37.630 --> 03:16:40.540
to the growth of economic efficiency.

03:16:40.960 --> 03:16:42.740
The foreign trade policy

03:16:42.750 --> 03:16:45.160
should be liberal.

03:16:47.700 --> 03:16:50.240
And less efficient producers, especially

03:16:50.340 --> 03:16:52.580
national ones, may eventually

03:16:52.590 --> 03:16:54.480
leave the world market,

03:16:54.490 --> 03:16:56.260
ruin themselves, because

03:16:56.840 --> 03:16:58.240
they organize production

03:16:58.250 --> 03:16:59.720
irrationally, use the

03:16:59.940 --> 03:17:02.940
factor of production irrationally.

03:17:03.460 --> 03:17:06.160
However, given the issue of

03:17:06.170 --> 03:17:08.600
social justice, such an effect from

03:17:08.610 --> 03:17:10.440
foreign trade policy would probably

03:17:10.450 --> 03:17:11.760
be negative for the development

03:17:11.770 --> 03:17:13.120
of the country.

03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:15.740
The second issue, the social

03:17:15.750 --> 03:17:16.980
justice issue, is therefore

03:17:17.940 --> 03:17:18.940
important.

03:17:19.380 --> 03:17:20.820
At least, when we consider for

03:17:20.830 --> 03:17:24.620
and against the introduction of

03:17:24.630 --> 03:17:27.560
tariffs, we will consider a number

03:17:27.570 --> 03:17:30.500
of aspects that push the state,

03:17:30.510 --> 03:17:32.460
the government, to include

03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:35.840
all the positions in foreign

03:17:35.850 --> 03:17:37.660
trade policy that support the social

03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:40.760
protection of citizens of

03:17:40.770 --> 03:17:42.660
the national economy.

03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:45.900
The foreign trade policy

03:17:45.910 --> 03:17:47.760
is a compromise.

03:17:47.800 --> 03:17:51.240
The compromise that economic agents

03:17:51.250 --> 03:17:53.680
have chosen for the given

03:17:53.690 --> 03:17:55.600
timeframe is a compromise

03:17:55.610 --> 03:17:57.140
between economic efficiency

03:17:57.150 --> 03:17:59.620
and social justice.

03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:02.720
The level of this compromise depends on the

03:18:02.730 --> 03:18:06.400
level of development of society.

03:18:07.380 --> 03:18:08.840
What are the barriers to the effectiveness

03:18:08.850 --> 03:18:10.200
of government regulation?

03:18:10.340 --> 03:18:11.960
After all, not everything goes smoothly,

03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:13.660
despite the fact that some legislative

03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:15.240
acts have been signed, some measures

03:18:15.250 --> 03:18:16.740
of foreign trade regulation

03:18:16.750 --> 03:18:18.300
have been developed.

03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:21.160
First of all, it is a rent-

03:18:21.170 --> 03:18:22.820
oriented behavior of politicians.

03:18:23.560 --> 03:18:25.320
Because foreign trade revenues

03:18:25.330 --> 03:18:26.500
are distributed unequally,

03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:29.220
as already mentioned in the previous

03:18:29.230 --> 03:18:32.780
lecture, owners of specific

03:18:32.790 --> 03:18:34.060
factors, unique factors,

03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:36.120
they usually get more income

03:18:36.130 --> 03:18:37.740
when world prices rise

03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:40.200
from foreign trade, and

03:18:40.210 --> 03:18:41.840
owners of neutral factors

03:18:41.850 --> 03:18:44.800
have less income.

03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:46.820
Moreover, all those who are involved

03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:48.700
in imports and replacement industries

03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:50.680
when prices fall due to the development

03:18:50.690 --> 03:18:52.780
of international trade,

03:18:53.060 --> 03:18:55.320
are virtually uncompetitive.

03:18:55.380 --> 03:18:58.640
These owners are losing income.

03:18:58.760 --> 03:18:59.960
So, the rental-oriented behavior

03:18:59.970 --> 03:19:02.040
of politicians is related to the group

03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:06.900
in which these politicians belong.

03:19:07.740 --> 03:19:11.180
The most relevant example.

03:19:11.700 --> 03:19:14.980
Suppose politicians are linked to agricultural

03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:16.160
parties.

03:19:16.520 --> 03:19:18.960
Of course, it is import and

03:19:18.970 --> 03:19:22.480
replacement sector with its own problems.

03:19:22.680 --> 03:19:24.720
And, of course, representatives

03:19:24.730 --> 03:19:26.940
of the agricultural parties will advocate

03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:28.180
a tough protectionist policy,

03:19:28.190 --> 03:19:30.540
which we have, for example, in the

03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:32.620
European Union.

03:19:33.280 --> 03:19:35.300
On the other hand, those policies

03:19:35.460 --> 03:19:38.300
belonging to the group of

03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:40.900
exporting raw materials such

03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:42.900
as oil and gas, in the conditions

03:19:42.910 --> 03:19:45.920
of the current market conditions,

03:19:45.930 --> 03:19:47.300
when prices of these energy

03:19:47.310 --> 03:19:49.640
sources are constantly

03:19:49.650 --> 03:19:51.720
rising, will be interested in

03:19:51.960 --> 03:19:54.160
developing the liberalization

03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:56.060
of foreign trade

03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:57.600
relations and expanding

03:19:57.610 --> 03:19:59.300
foreign trade.

03:19:59.860 --> 03:20:01.980
And eventually, these and others

03:20:01.990 --> 03:20:04.100
will conduct, lobby their decisions

03:20:04.110 --> 03:20:05.480
in government structures

03:20:05.490 --> 03:20:07.500
in order to conduct one

03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:09.000
or another type of

03:20:09.010 --> 03:20:10.480
economic policy.

03:20:11.140 --> 03:20:13.400
Subjective reason is also a barrier

03:20:13.410 --> 03:20:14.520
to the effectiveness

03:20:14.530 --> 03:20:16.640
of state regulation.

03:20:17.300 --> 03:20:19.320
The subjective reason is related,

03:20:19.330 --> 03:20:20.940
in general, to the development,

03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:22.620
to the literacy of those

03:20:23.020 --> 03:20:25.920
politicians who make state decisions.

03:20:26.120 --> 03:20:28.520
It is assumed that, if,

03:20:28.530 --> 03:20:29.840
of course, they have a theoretical

03:20:29.850 --> 03:20:31.420
economic education, they will

03:20:31.430 --> 03:20:33.480
adequately deal with the

03:20:33.490 --> 03:20:34.440
problems of state

03:20:34.450 --> 03:20:35.840
regulation and international

03:20:35.850 --> 03:20:36.920
economy.

03:20:37.260 --> 03:20:38.760
But on the other hand, they may

03:20:38.770 --> 03:20:41.000
have their own subjective views

03:20:41.010 --> 03:20:43.040
on how economic policy should

03:20:43.050 --> 03:20:44.820
be conducted, and, accordingly,

03:20:44.830 --> 03:20:46.020
they may curb the

03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:47.060
effectiveness of government

03:20:47.070 --> 03:20:48.940
regulation.

03:20:49.220 --> 03:20:51.140
The next aspect is hardware

03:20:51.150 --> 03:20:53.200
distortion or policy change.

03:20:53.680 --> 03:20:56.340
This reason is related to the

03:20:56.350 --> 03:20:57.720
two previous ones.

03:20:58.300 --> 03:21:00.880
In principle, you can legislatively

03:21:00.890 --> 03:21:03.900
develop very good laws and try

03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:05.880
to implement them in real

03:21:05.890 --> 03:21:07.080
practice.

03:21:07.260 --> 03:21:09.580
So, the apparatus, that is, those

03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:11.660
officials who implement these economic

03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:16.340
laws in practice, they can distort the

03:21:16.740 --> 03:21:20.780
policy goals in connection with the

03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:22.700
fact that they have their own group

03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:25.720
and personal interests, and they will

03:21:25.730 --> 03:21:28.440
lobby the interests of those

03:21:28.450 --> 03:21:30.360
groups to which they belong.

03:21:30.540 --> 03:21:32.700
The next reason is the influence

03:21:32.710 --> 03:21:34.540
of outdated economic concepts.

03:21:35.020 --> 03:21:38.120
The example is the state regulation

03:21:38.130 --> 03:21:39.220
in Russia.

03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:43.200
In the early 1990s, liberalization

03:21:43.210 --> 03:21:44.380
was the main principle

03:21:44.390 --> 03:21:46.680
of foreign policy.

03:21:48.320 --> 03:21:51.900
As part of liberalization, the Russian

03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:53.420
government sought to increase export

03:21:53.430 --> 03:21:56.080
and import flows in order to saturate

03:21:56.090 --> 03:21:58.820
the Russian economy with deficit

03:21:58.830 --> 03:22:01.500
goods and to remove the

03:22:01.510 --> 03:22:03.720
problem of food deficit.

03:22:04.620 --> 03:22:09.240
But by the year 95 the situation had evolved

03:22:09.250 --> 03:22:13.000
so that such liberalism was

03:22:13.010 --> 03:22:14.200
contrary to the interests

03:22:14.210 --> 03:22:15.660
of national producers.

03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:20.380
And, accordingly, liberalization

03:22:25.650 --> 03:22:29.040
has become somehow conducted

03:22:29.050 --> 03:22:32.080
tougher foreign trade policy.

03:22:32.300 --> 03:22:34.020
Russia has been negotiating

03:22:34.380 --> 03:22:36.760
its accession to the WTO

03:22:36.770 --> 03:22:38.140
since the same year.

03:22:38.320 --> 03:22:39.660
Accordingly, within such strategic

03:22:39.670 --> 03:22:42.420
objectives, the ideas and

03:22:42.430 --> 03:22:45.960
policies of liberalization must

03:22:45.970 --> 03:22:47.180
be carried out again.

03:22:48.220 --> 03:22:49.780
Productionism is

03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:51.360
now an outdated economic

03:22:52.060 --> 03:22:55.000
concept for the 2000s.

03:22:55.010 --> 03:22:56.660


03:22:57.060 --> 03:22:58.540
Ultimately, as I said, the

03:22:58.550 --> 03:23:02.760
result of a compromise can

03:23:02.770 --> 03:23:06.200
be some sort of intermediate

03:23:06.210 --> 03:23:08.200
foreign trade policy that

03:23:08.210 --> 03:23:10.020
takes into account different

03:23:10.030 --> 03:23:12.200
interest groups.

03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:14.100
The degree of development of

03:23:14.110 --> 03:23:15.900
market relations is also another

03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:17.980
reason for decreasing the effectiveness

03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:20.560
of state regulation.

03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:22.660
As practice shows, developed

03:23:23.020 --> 03:23:26.320
countries with a developed

03:23:26.330 --> 03:23:29.200
legal system more consistently

03:23:29.210 --> 03:23:31.940
implement state regulation measures.

03:23:32.660 --> 03:23:36.260
At the same time, countries with a

03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:37.980
transitional economy, the so-

03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:39.580
called transformational economy or

03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:43.600
a catching economy, within the framework

03:23:43.610 --> 03:23:47.180
of the underdevelopment of

03:23:47.360 --> 03:23:50.820
the legal framework,

03:23:50.830 --> 03:23:53.200
of course, the development of state

03:23:54.320 --> 03:23:57.800
policy is in more difficult circumstances

03:23:57.810 --> 03:24:02.300
and, accordingly, the results

03:24:02.310 --> 03:24:04.700
of such state policy can

03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:06.000
be less effective.

03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:08.400
The next factor is the degree of

03:24:08.410 --> 03:24:09.660
openness of the economy.

03:24:09.740 --> 03:24:12.440
Strangely enough, all countries,

03:24:12.450 --> 03:24:14.620
at least 150 members of the WTO, are

03:24:14.860 --> 03:24:16.040
generally in favor of

03:24:16.050 --> 03:24:17.540
a consistent liberalization of

03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:19.140
foreign trade relations.

03:24:19.820 --> 03:24:21.840
But as practice shows, once countries

03:24:21.850 --> 03:24:23.240
become sufficiently strongly

03:24:23.250 --> 03:24:24.840
integrated into international

03:24:24.850 --> 03:24:26.020
economic relations, into

03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:27.280
the international division

03:24:27.290 --> 03:24:30.520
of labor, as soon as they develop

03:24:30.530 --> 03:24:32.420
an export-initiated sector,

03:24:32.430 --> 03:24:35.520
they become dependent on the

03:24:35.530 --> 03:24:38.420
problems of cataclysms

03:24:38.860 --> 03:24:41.940
that may arise in the world economy.

03:24:43.700 --> 03:24:46.980
Based on this, the effectiveness

03:24:46.990 --> 03:24:49.420
of state policy in these national

03:24:49.430 --> 03:24:51.440
economies will actually depend

03:24:51.450 --> 03:24:53.500
on the overall global

03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:56.940
economic situation.

03:24:57.120 --> 03:24:59.300
Autoritarian actions of the state

03:24:59.310 --> 03:25:00.900
are another problem.

03:25:00.910 --> 03:25:04.020
And here the most typical example is the

03:25:04.030 --> 03:25:06.260
example of a state order.

03:25:06.380 --> 03:25:07.900
That is, by distributing

03:25:09.470 --> 03:25:11.640
government orders, our representatives

03:25:11.650 --> 03:25:13.640
of the state power will

03:25:13.650 --> 03:25:16.980
support various industrial

03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:19.840
groups, various industry

03:25:19.850 --> 03:25:22.260
structures to a certain

03:25:22.270 --> 03:25:23.420
extent.

03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:27.000
And, accordingly, these actions

03:25:27.010 --> 03:25:28.720
of the government can be

03:25:28.730 --> 03:25:31.240
authoritarian in nature, because,

03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:33.560
again, they are carried

03:25:33.570 --> 03:25:36.680
out by certain officials, and

03:25:36.690 --> 03:25:37.980
there is both rent-

03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:39.760
oriented behavior and hardware

03:25:39.770 --> 03:25:40.920
distortions.

03:25:42.480 --> 03:25:44.740
An example of such authoritarian

03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:47.000
actions by the state, for example,

03:25:48.200 --> 03:25:49.780
are the effects of environmental

03:25:49.790 --> 03:25:51.460
pollution.

03:25:52.140 --> 03:25:57.460
In particular, as is known, our

03:25:57.470 --> 03:25:59.540
corporation Minatom will import

03:25:59.550 --> 03:26:01.580
industrial waste from nuclear

03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:03.460
power plants to the territory

03:26:03.470 --> 03:26:05.560
of Russia in terms

03:26:05.570 --> 03:26:07.500
of economic efficiency.

03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:09.140
This is, of course, a positive

03:26:09.150 --> 03:26:10.940
result, because there are investments

03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:12.660
in the development of nuclear energy

03:26:12.670 --> 03:26:18.820
as a fee for the transport of

03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:19.720
such waste.

03:26:19.740 --> 03:26:21.480
But on the other hand, in terms

03:26:21.490 --> 03:26:24.620
of general social, global problems,

03:26:24.630 --> 03:26:27.420
they are only worsening.

03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:29.840
The next factor in reducing

03:26:29.850 --> 03:26:31.040
the effectiveness of state

03:26:31.050 --> 03:26:32.560
regulation is the

03:26:32.570 --> 03:26:34.480
mutually exclusive areas

03:26:34.490 --> 03:26:36.100
of state policy.

03:26:37.140 --> 03:26:38.980
I have already said how the

03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:40.560
credit-monetary and budget-tax

03:26:40.570 --> 03:26:42.480
policy is linked with

03:26:42.490 --> 03:26:44.260
foreign trade policy.

03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:45.920
And, accordingly, the government

03:26:45.930 --> 03:26:50.480
can take measures related to budget

03:26:50.490 --> 03:26:51.600
regulation, the Central

03:26:51.780 --> 03:26:54.540
Bank, measures of credit and monetary

03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:57.620
policy that will clearly level

03:26:57.630 --> 03:26:59.780
those steps that have been taken

03:26:59.790 --> 03:27:02.480
in foreign trade policy.

03:27:03.300 --> 03:27:05.840
Well, in this case, the simplest

03:27:05.850 --> 03:27:08.700
example, if the Central Bank

03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:11.100
for some reason refuses to support

03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:14.760
the decline of the ruble in modern

03:27:14.770 --> 03:27:16.560
conditions, the ruble price begins

03:27:16.570 --> 03:27:18.540
to rise, and this, in turn,

03:27:18.550 --> 03:27:23.060
again makes the prices

03:27:23.070 --> 03:27:26.980
of our export goods rise

03:27:26.990 --> 03:27:30.260
and makes them less competitive.

03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:33.100
And then, in the conditions

03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:35.340
of such a disadvantage,

03:27:35.350 --> 03:27:37.280
the liberal foreign trade policy, it

03:27:37.290 --> 03:27:39.440
will, in essence, contradict such

03:27:39.450 --> 03:27:41.400
activities of the Central Bank and

03:27:41.410 --> 03:27:43.300
the effectiveness of liberalization

03:27:43.310 --> 03:27:45.760
of foreign trade relations

03:27:45.770 --> 03:27:48.100
will decrease.

03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:53.200
There are two main trends in the development

03:27:53.210 --> 03:27:55.060
of foreign trade policy.

03:27:55.180 --> 03:27:56.300
This is free trading.

03:27:56.740 --> 03:27:59.840
The modern term of free trading is the

03:27:59.850 --> 03:28:02.720
liberalization of foreign trade relations.

03:28:04.540 --> 03:28:05.940
Freehandling implies the removal

03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:08.220
of all foreign trade restrictions

03:28:08.230 --> 03:28:11.360
and the development of free competition.

03:28:12.100 --> 03:28:14.320
Of course, the option

03:28:14.330 --> 03:28:15.440
of free-trade or liberal policy

03:28:15.450 --> 03:28:18.880
in absolute, full execution

03:28:18.890 --> 03:28:20.240
is impossible.

03:28:20.380 --> 03:28:22.380
Each country has its own national

03:28:22.390 --> 03:28:23.900
interests.

03:28:23.920 --> 03:28:25.920
Again, there are those industries,

03:28:26.140 --> 03:28:28.400
groups that should be protected

03:28:28.410 --> 03:28:29.560
socially.

03:28:29.740 --> 03:28:31.840
Therefore, no country has an

03:28:31.850 --> 03:28:34.880
ideal free-trade policy.

03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:38.980
In economic theory, you once studied

03:28:38.990 --> 03:28:41.760
the variant of perfect competition.

03:28:42.060 --> 03:28:44.560
Perfect competition, like absolute

03:28:44.570 --> 03:28:46.480
liberalization, are some hypothetical

03:28:46.490 --> 03:28:48.280
ideal models of development

03:28:48.290 --> 03:28:51.120
of foreign trade relations.

03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:52.960
and protectionism.

03:28:52.970 --> 03:28:54.920
Protectionism is another extreme in the

03:28:54.930 --> 03:28:56.660
development of foreign trade policy.

03:28:57.160 --> 03:28:58.720
It protects the internal

03:28:58.730 --> 03:29:02.040
market from foreign competition.

03:29:03.520 --> 03:29:04.740
And the second half

03:29:04.750 --> 03:29:07.880
of protectionist policy is related to

03:29:07.890 --> 03:29:10.060
the development, stimulation of

03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:12.380
export industries and, accordingly,

03:29:12.390 --> 03:29:14.280
the activities of the state to

03:29:19.210 --> 03:29:22.120
provide aid, the development of

03:29:22.130 --> 03:29:26.680
export firms and the capture of

03:29:26.690 --> 03:29:28.960
some foreign trade markets.

03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:33.860
The history of foreign trade policy of the

03:29:33.870 --> 03:29:37.620
20th century is quite dynamic.

03:29:37.980 --> 03:29:40.660
And this story shows how, depending

03:29:41.240 --> 03:29:42.140
on the economic, domestic

03:29:42.150 --> 03:29:43.800
and foreign economic situation,

03:29:43.810 --> 03:29:45.900
governments of different countries

03:29:45.910 --> 03:29:48.360
are fluctuating in developing

03:29:48.980 --> 03:29:50.660
foreign trade policies

03:29:50.670 --> 03:29:52.340
from policies close to

03:29:52.350 --> 03:29:54.820
greater liberalization

03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:57.440
to policies that involve

03:29:57.450 --> 03:29:59.420
stronger protectionist

03:29:59.430 --> 03:30:01.060
protective measures.

03:30:01.480 --> 03:30:05.040
If you take the beginning of the 20th century,

03:30:05.050 --> 03:30:07.700
the 30s is the period of the Great Depression.

03:30:07.940 --> 03:30:10.040
The objective of foreign

03:30:10.050 --> 03:30:11.940
trade policy is to protect

03:30:11.950 --> 03:30:13.360
national producers.

03:30:14.000 --> 03:30:16.540
This is why foreign trade policy of

03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:18.160
this period can be called

03:30:18.170 --> 03:30:19.900
aggressive protectionism.

03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:22.460
It is characterized by trade wars.

03:30:22.560 --> 03:30:24.180
That is, when one country, the other

03:30:24.190 --> 03:30:26.720
country introduces increasing and

03:30:26.730 --> 03:30:29.320
rising foreign trade barriers,

03:30:29.330 --> 03:30:33.800
there is a rise in tariff rates.

03:30:34.520 --> 03:30:37.980
After World War II, there

03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:39.400
were long-term trends in

03:30:39.410 --> 03:30:40.620
liberalization of foreign

03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:42.100
trade relations.

03:30:42.140 --> 03:30:45.020
During the Second World War, many countries

03:30:45.030 --> 03:30:47.700
came to the conclusion that it was necessary

03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:51.380
to develop interrelated

03:30:51.390 --> 03:30:55.560
interests, to develop exports

03:30:55.860 --> 03:30:58.960
and imports between countries.

03:30:59.140 --> 03:31:01.060
And, accordingly, the policy

03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:04.980
that will stimulate this development

03:31:04.990 --> 03:31:07.480
is the policy of liberalization.

03:31:09.680 --> 03:31:13.500
The most typical example

03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:14.940
of post-war liberalization

03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:16.820
is the Marshal Plan.

03:31:18.260 --> 03:31:22.420
As part of this plan, which was

03:31:22.430 --> 03:31:23.920
developed in the United States,

03:31:23.930 --> 03:31:26.240
the United States provides

03:31:26.250 --> 03:31:28.320
economic financial assistance to

03:31:28.330 --> 03:31:32.000
the postwar economies of Europe.

03:31:32.300 --> 03:31:35.100
But the condition for such financial

03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:37.220
investment support is the liberalization

03:31:37.230 --> 03:31:39.880
of foreign trade relations.

03:31:40.440 --> 03:31:44.320
In the 1950s and 1960s, the process of

03:31:44.330 --> 03:31:46.140
liberalization continued.

03:31:46.720 --> 03:31:48.480
And it is in this period that the

03:31:48.490 --> 03:31:50.880
first agreements are made related

03:31:50.890 --> 03:31:53.280
to the development of

03:31:53.290 --> 03:31:57.700
the international system, which

03:31:57.710 --> 03:31:59.460
has now developed in the

03:31:59.470 --> 03:32:02.240
World Trade Organization system.

03:32:02.500 --> 03:32:04.260
The first documents of the General

03:32:04.270 --> 03:32:06.440
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

03:32:06.450 --> 03:32:08.280
were signed.

03:32:08.780 --> 03:32:11.840
In the 1970s, they were characterized

03:32:11.850 --> 03:32:14.480
by the exacerbation of crisis situations

03:32:14.490 --> 03:32:16.160
of domestic economies in the world

03:32:16.170 --> 03:32:16.860
as a whole.

03:32:16.980 --> 03:32:18.680
In the 1970s, a major

03:32:18.690 --> 03:32:22.820
structural currency financial

03:32:22.830 --> 03:32:25.840
crises occurred in

03:32:25.850 --> 03:32:28.120
most countries, in most

03:32:28.130 --> 03:32:31.020
developed economies.

03:32:32.340 --> 03:32:36.100
Accordingly, over the years, the purpose of

03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:38.800
the government of many countries in the world has changed.

03:32:39.280 --> 03:32:42.180
They are introducing tough protective

03:32:42.190 --> 03:32:44.280
protectionism measures.

03:32:44.960 --> 03:32:46.220
A regional protectionism

03:32:46.230 --> 03:32:47.840
system is being developed.

03:32:47.860 --> 03:32:50.460
This is about the development of

03:32:50.470 --> 03:32:52.160
regional protectionism within

03:32:52.170 --> 03:32:55.180
Europe and the European Union.

03:32:56.160 --> 03:32:59.720
Since the 1990s, the development

03:32:59.730 --> 03:33:02.700
of the world economy has come

03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:05.820
to some stabilization process.

03:33:06.060 --> 03:33:07.400
Accordingly, in this period of

03:33:07.410 --> 03:33:09.180
time, as many countries do not experience

03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:11.520
financial and economic difficulties,

03:33:11.530 --> 03:33:14.400
the issues of liberalization

03:33:14.410 --> 03:33:16.380
of foreign trade relations

03:33:16.390 --> 03:33:19.140
are becoming relevant again.

03:33:19.720 --> 03:33:22.780
It is at this time that the general

03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:24.800
threat of nuts in trade finally

03:33:24.810 --> 03:33:27.200
turns into an agreement

03:33:27.210 --> 03:33:28.900
within the World Trade

03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:30.400
Organization.

03:33:31.060 --> 03:33:32.740
The processes of such international

03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:34.440
mutual coordination of foreign

03:33:34.450 --> 03:33:37.560
trade policy are gaining strength.

03:33:38.060 --> 03:33:41.060
These processes haveined their

03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:44.960
trend since 2000 and in the 21st century.

03:33:44.970 --> 03:33:46.140


03:33:49.040 --> 03:33:51.740
What are the characteristics of modern protectionism?

03:33:52.280 --> 03:33:54.640
First of all, it is local.

03:33:58.060 --> 03:33:59.980
Local protectionism implies the

03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:01.880
separation of different groups of countries

03:34:01.890 --> 03:34:02.880
in the world.

03:34:02.940 --> 03:34:05.800
Developing, developed and transitional

03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:07.640
economies.

03:34:08.860 --> 03:34:10.340
First, there is protectionism

03:34:10.350 --> 03:34:14.220
among developed countries.

03:34:14.230 --> 03:34:15.200
In what area?

03:34:15.580 --> 03:34:18.740
In less protected, associated with

03:34:18.750 --> 03:34:21.880
processes of climate complications.

03:34:21.890 --> 03:34:23.600
This is agriculture.

03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:27.600
So far, the shifts in the elimination

03:34:27.610 --> 03:34:30.720
or reduction of agricultural

03:34:30.730 --> 03:34:33.480
protectionism are quite insignificant.

03:34:33.700 --> 03:34:35.860
If we take the European Union,

03:34:36.020 --> 03:34:37.460
there are quite strict restrictions

03:34:37.470 --> 03:34:39.620
on imports of agricultural

03:34:39.630 --> 03:34:41.960
products from other

03:34:41.970 --> 03:34:43.880
non-Union countries.

03:34:44.180 --> 03:34:46.100
The next sphere of regional

03:34:46.110 --> 03:34:49.260
protectionism is the textile

03:34:49.270 --> 03:34:51.180
industry, clothing and

03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:53.100
steel industry.

03:34:54.540 --> 03:34:57.360
The second group of countries linked

03:34:57.370 --> 03:34:58.540
between popular and local

03:34:58.550 --> 03:35:00.340
protectionism is protectionism between

03:35:00.350 --> 03:35:03.420
developed and developing countries.

03:35:03.940 --> 03:35:07.020
The main problem here is that developing

03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:09.880
countries with export-oriented

03:35:09.890 --> 03:35:13.140
economies are developing exports

03:35:15.320 --> 03:35:17.160
of production of goods and services,

03:35:17.170 --> 03:35:19.420
which are focused on consumption

03:35:19.430 --> 03:35:21.660
in developed countries.

03:35:21.680 --> 03:35:23.760
Accordingly, they

03:35:23.770 --> 03:35:25.700
exert a strong pressure

03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:28.400
on competition in

03:35:28.410 --> 03:35:30.360
developed countries.

03:35:30.370 --> 03:35:31.200


03:35:31.400 --> 03:35:33.360
In this regard, developed countries,

03:35:33.480 --> 03:35:34.880
protecting their national

03:35:34.890 --> 03:35:38.700
producers, introduce various trade

03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:41.460
restrictions not only tax, but

03:35:41.470 --> 03:35:43.880
also various quantitative

03:35:43.890 --> 03:35:45.800
restrictions, quotas on imports

03:35:45.810 --> 03:35:49.200
of goods from developing countries.

03:35:50.680 --> 03:35:52.920
And the last group of countries

03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:54.640
linked to local protectionism

03:35:54.650 --> 03:35:58.200
are developing countries.

03:35:58.210 --> 03:36:00.900
There are problems

03:36:00.910 --> 03:36:04.240
with traditional exports.

03:36:05.820 --> 03:36:07.320
What are the characteristics

03:36:07.330 --> 03:36:09.280
of modern liberalization and

03:36:09.290 --> 03:36:11.160
modern protectionism?

03:36:11.580 --> 03:36:14.640
First, within the framework of modern

03:36:14.650 --> 03:36:16.540
liberalization processes,

03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:21.140
the scope of instruments regulating

03:36:21.150 --> 03:36:23.120
mechanisms of foreign trade

03:36:23.130 --> 03:36:25.060
relations is expanding.

03:36:25.620 --> 03:36:27.780
In addition to tariffs, various

03:36:27.790 --> 03:36:30.140
forms of financial support

03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:32.740
are applied, which are in principle

03:36:36.910 --> 03:36:40.740
less calculated and less subject

03:36:40.750 --> 03:36:46.040
to international agreements.

03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:47.320
The next feature of modern

03:36:47.330 --> 03:36:49.460
liberalization is the

03:36:49.470 --> 03:36:50.920
multilateral liberalization

03:36:50.930 --> 03:36:52.160
of foreign trade.

03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:54.080
First of all, these are relations

03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:55.660
between countries within the framework

03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:57.100
of the World Trade Organization

03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:58.640
negotiation process.

03:36:58.650 --> 03:37:02.000
In general, modern liberalization is associated

03:37:02.010 --> 03:37:04.180
with the reduction of the overall level

03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:05.120
of all barriers.

03:37:05.720 --> 03:37:07.320
And this, as I said, is a long-

03:37:07.740 --> 03:37:11.220
term trend of the 21st century.

03:37:12.260 --> 03:37:15.500
Regional integration associated with

03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:17.160
the formation of integration

03:37:17.170 --> 03:37:22.340
unions is a form of unions that develop

03:37:22.350 --> 03:37:24.220
quite rapidly in the modern

03:37:24.230 --> 03:37:25.300
world space.

03:37:26.900 --> 03:37:30.580
Regional integration is characterized

03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:33.240
by both liberalization and protectionism.

03:37:33.250 --> 03:37:34.600


03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:36.580
After all, countries that join in integration

03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:40.160
alliances remove trade barriers

03:37:40.170 --> 03:37:42.840
between themselves.

03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:44.800
But in relation to third countries,

03:37:44.810 --> 03:37:47.720
they are developing a common system

03:37:47.730 --> 03:37:50.680
of tariff barriers and other methods of

03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:52.160
protectionist protection.

03:37:52.820 --> 03:37:54.300
In this case, the economic

03:37:54.310 --> 03:37:56.160
theory proposes to consider

03:37:56.170 --> 03:38:01.300
two effects of regional integration.

03:38:01.460 --> 03:38:03.300
This is the effect of creating trade and

03:38:03.310 --> 03:38:05.080
the effect of rejecting trade.

03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:08.640
The effect of creating trade is related

03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:14.800
to the fact that if countries

03:38:14.810 --> 03:38:19.060
that have joined in an integration

03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:21.240
union to develop international

03:38:21.250 --> 03:38:23.700
economic relations, switch

03:38:23.940 --> 03:38:27.700
and develop production

03:38:28.620 --> 03:38:30.460
in their own countries,

03:38:30.470 --> 03:38:32.500
oriented to international

03:38:32.510 --> 03:38:34.040
flows, in connection with

03:38:34.050 --> 03:38:36.660
the fact that this production

03:38:36.670 --> 03:38:38.740
is cheaper, more efficient,

03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:40.420
more rational.

03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:43.040
Then yes, the countries members

03:38:43.050 --> 03:38:45.340
of the integration union develop

03:38:45.350 --> 03:38:47.060
international trade, increase

03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:48.600
the volume of international

03:38:48.610 --> 03:38:49.680
trade within their

03:38:49.690 --> 03:38:51.540
integration group.

03:38:52.400 --> 03:38:54.140
The second option is the effect of trade

03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:56.480
deviation, which is related to the fact

03:38:56.490 --> 03:38:58.500
that the lower costs and

03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:59.600
more efficient organization

03:38:59.610 --> 03:39:01.020
of production can be in those countries

03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:04.500
that, as a result of the formation

03:39:11.290 --> 03:39:12.820
of an integration union, draw their

03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:15.100
flow of effectively created products

03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:16.620
to the integration market,

03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:19.240
and the countries - members

03:39:19.250 --> 03:39:20.680
of the integration union

03:39:20.690 --> 03:39:22.920
begin to consume goods with

03:39:22.930 --> 03:39:26.360
higher costs, goods of less

03:39:26.370 --> 03:39:28.040
efficient production.

03:39:28.640 --> 03:39:30.620
This variant of economic relations

03:39:30.630 --> 03:39:34.100
is precisely connected, I will repeat,

03:39:34.110 --> 03:39:36.380
with the effect of trade deviation.

03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:39.560
External trade flows are decreasing.

03:39:39.570 --> 03:39:41.020
If we consider the forms of

03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:43.640
protectionism, then the modern theory

03:39:43.650 --> 03:39:45.560
proposes to highlight the following

03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:48.020
variants of these forms, first

03:39:48.400 --> 03:39:50.800
of all, selective protectionism.

03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:52.600
Selective protectionism is

03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:54.320
a measure that is directed

03:39:54.580 --> 03:39:58.980
at certain spheres of economic

03:39:58.990 --> 03:40:01.200
activity, not even on goods

03:40:02.640 --> 03:40:06.860
created in a particular

03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:08.240
industry, such as textiles,

03:40:08.250 --> 03:40:10.560
but only on some groups of

03:40:10.570 --> 03:40:12.360
product maneculture.

03:40:12.900 --> 03:40:14.580
Such selective protectionism is usually

03:40:14.590 --> 03:40:16.980
associated with the maintenance,

03:40:16.990 --> 03:40:18.420
for example, of seasonal duties, which

03:40:18.430 --> 03:40:19.880
will be discussed further.

03:40:22.500 --> 03:40:24.440
A typical example of sectoral

03:40:24.450 --> 03:40:27.920
protectionism is the protectionism of

03:40:27.930 --> 03:40:31.840
the European Union countries to protect

03:40:31.850 --> 03:40:32.520
their national

03:40:32.530 --> 03:40:34.220
and agricultural production.

03:40:34.230 --> 03:40:36.620
The hidden protectionism.

03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:39.300
Hidden protectionism implies such

03:40:39.310 --> 03:40:41.340
measures of foreign trade

03:40:41.350 --> 03:40:43.980
regulation that are difficult

03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:45.820
to account for.

03:40:46.280 --> 03:40:48.100
First of all, these are financial measures.

03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:50.300
Openly Protektionist

03:40:50.560 --> 03:40:53.020
This form of protectionism involves

03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:56.560
the maintenance of various duties

03:40:56.570 --> 03:40:59.200
or quantitative restrictions.

03:40:59.210 --> 03:41:01.700
Of course, open protectionism

03:41:01.710 --> 03:41:04.780
is more prone to state regulation

03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:07.740
and by international

03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:10.240
and economic agreements.

03:41:10.900 --> 03:41:12.120
And the measures of open

03:41:12.130 --> 03:41:16.840
protectionism are now being reduced.

03:41:17.600 --> 03:41:19.260
In general, countries are trying

03:41:19.270 --> 03:41:21.280
to use hidden protectionism.

03:41:23.450 --> 03:41:26.670
What are the arguments for and against protectionism?

03:41:27.310 --> 03:41:30.430
In general, economic theory

03:41:30.440 --> 03:41:32.650
has a lot of works that are devoted

03:41:32.660 --> 03:41:34.390
to these arguments.

03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:36.930
There are authors who have a list of

03:41:36.940 --> 03:41:39.930
arguments for and against bringing to 140 positions.

03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:41.650
But we will only look at some of

03:41:41.660 --> 03:41:42.190
them.

03:41:42.910 --> 03:41:44.510
The argument against protectionism is

03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:49.630
put forward by the neoclassical school.

03:41:49.650 --> 03:41:51.110
In this case, the concept

03:41:51.120 --> 03:41:55.530
is what it implies.

03:41:55.730 --> 03:41:57.810
The idea is that better than

03:41:57.820 --> 03:41:59.950
liberal relations, the development

03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:02.130
of international trade for countries,

03:42:02.230 --> 03:42:03.990
for economic growth nothing

03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:05.330
else can be.

03:42:05.450 --> 03:42:07.290
There is no better alternative

03:42:07.300 --> 03:42:09.210
than an open economy.

03:42:09.890 --> 03:42:12.190
The classics are, of course, Adam Smith,

03:42:12.250 --> 03:42:14.290
Ricardo and modern representatives

03:42:14.300 --> 03:42:18.770
of this direction of monetary.

03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:24.150
The next position for inclusion

03:42:24.160 --> 03:42:26.950
of protectionism as a

03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:29.810
measure of state regulation is the

03:42:29.820 --> 03:42:32.230
doctrine of unused factors of production.

03:42:32.530 --> 03:42:34.090
What is meant here?

03:42:34.410 --> 03:42:37.030
When the country you want to export

03:42:37.040 --> 03:42:39.510
your goods to is somehow blocked

03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:41.930
from your trade flows

03:42:41.940 --> 03:42:43.510
by protectionist

03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:45.710
measures, you have the

03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:46.890
opportunity to go out to

03:42:46.900 --> 03:42:48.150
that market.

03:42:48.310 --> 03:42:50.130
And then you make investments,

03:42:50.140 --> 03:42:51.390
the production territory

03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:53.190
of these countries is organized.

03:42:53.850 --> 03:42:55.910
Moreover, you can use labor force

03:42:55.920 --> 03:42:59.630
or import labor force into

03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:00.730
your territory.

03:43:00.910 --> 03:43:02.770
Thus, the doctrine of unused

03:43:02.780 --> 03:43:03.810
factors shows that in such

03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:05.290
a difficult situation of foreign

03:43:05.300 --> 03:43:07.330
trade restrictions,

03:43:07.340 --> 03:43:09.530
countries still have a way out.

03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:11.730
This outcome contributes to the overall

03:43:11.740 --> 03:43:13.710
development of national economies

03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:16.910
and the world economy as a whole.

03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:18.670
The next substantial argument for the

03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:20.830
introduction of protectionism is the protection

03:43:20.840 --> 03:43:21.710
of jobs.

03:43:23.470 --> 03:43:26.430
This is a social argument.

03:43:26.910 --> 03:43:29.350
Imagine cities where there is

03:43:29.360 --> 03:43:31.190
the only enterprise where national

03:43:31.200 --> 03:43:36.730
investments can be employed.

03:43:36.740 --> 03:43:39.070
In terms of the development

03:43:39.080 --> 03:43:40.870
of these cities, these

03:43:40.880 --> 03:43:42.610
territories will have to beined

03:43:42.620 --> 03:43:44.750
by the state for some time,

03:43:44.760 --> 03:43:46.690
even if they are less

03:43:46.700 --> 03:43:48.770
competitive in the world

03:43:48.780 --> 03:43:50.810
economic space.

03:43:51.930 --> 03:43:54.230
The concept of economic security.

03:43:54.430 --> 03:43:55.550
Another argument for.

03:43:56.450 --> 03:43:58.450
It is related to the fact that any

03:43:58.460 --> 03:44:01.470
country presupposes the worst convergence

03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:02.730
of events.

03:44:02.740 --> 03:44:04.150
In the event of international

03:44:04.160 --> 03:44:06.190
political conflicts, each country

03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:10.290
should have a reserve for the development

03:44:10.300 --> 03:44:14.350
of its industries and the possibility

03:44:14.360 --> 03:44:17.230
of producing products

03:44:17.240 --> 03:44:19.710
in a closed national space.

03:44:20.310 --> 03:44:22.050
However, this concept has been

03:44:22.060 --> 03:44:25.150
modernized in modern conditions.

03:44:26.490 --> 03:44:29.970
It is not expected to introduce a

03:44:29.980 --> 03:44:32.250
system of completely closed, limited

03:44:32.260 --> 03:44:33.650
from international economic

03:44:33.660 --> 03:44:35.350
relations.

03:44:35.710 --> 03:44:36.790
The next argument is for.

03:44:36.800 --> 03:44:39.470
Protection of emerging national industries.

03:44:39.630 --> 03:44:42.070
This argument is usually given

03:44:42.080 --> 03:44:44.170
by developing countries.

03:44:44.250 --> 03:44:48.470
For them, export-oriented

03:44:48.480 --> 03:44:50.090
production is often

03:44:50.100 --> 03:44:53.670
the main form of receiving

03:44:53.680 --> 03:44:58.130
national income.

03:44:58.140 --> 03:45:01.610
And, of course, as these

03:45:01.620 --> 03:45:03.370
countries develop

03:45:03.380 --> 03:45:05.090
industry, they become industrialized,

03:45:06.820 --> 03:45:09.170
and for some period the short-

03:45:09.180 --> 03:45:15.790
term protection of these

03:45:15.800 --> 03:45:18.550
new emerging industries

03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:21.070
is very important to these

03:45:21.080 --> 03:45:21.810
countries.

03:45:22.270 --> 03:45:25.070
This is considered a normal form

03:45:25.080 --> 03:45:27.570
of protection against international

03:45:27.580 --> 03:45:30.250
competition.

03:45:31.250 --> 03:45:32.690
Let us now consider the instruments

03:45:32.700 --> 03:45:34.070
of state regulation of foreign

03:45:34.080 --> 03:45:35.210
trade.

03:45:35.330 --> 03:45:37.730
There are many of them and they can

03:45:37.740 --> 03:45:41.170
be classified according to different principles.

03:45:41.650 --> 03:45:46.530
In general, the whole group of measures

03:45:46.540 --> 03:45:47.810
to protect the national economy,

03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:50.650
protectionist measures are divided into

03:45:50.660 --> 03:45:52.430
two large groups - tariff and

03:45:52.440 --> 03:45:53.930
non-tariff barriers.

03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:58.190
If you take tariff barriers, they

03:45:58.200 --> 03:46:00.630
include first of all the two

03:46:00.640 --> 03:46:03.750
most unique or most developed forms

03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:05.890
- these are customs duties

03:46:05.900 --> 03:46:07.730
and tariff quotas, which

03:46:07.740 --> 03:46:09.470
we will talk about later.

03:46:09.480 --> 03:46:12.350
Non-tariff measures are

03:46:12.360 --> 03:46:14.150
quantitative restrictions.

03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:16.510
Such restrictions are not

03:46:16.520 --> 03:46:17.790
welcomed by the international

03:46:17.800 --> 03:46:19.490
community because they

03:46:19.500 --> 03:46:22.810
completely block trade flows.

03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:28.250
Hidden measures of protectionism are

03:46:28.260 --> 03:46:29.930
sufficiently developed in modern conditions,

03:46:29.940 --> 03:46:32.110
and developed countries are trying

03:46:32.120 --> 03:46:33.850
to resort to them, because they

03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:36.510
are difficult to take into account

03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:39.050
other countries - counterparties, it

03:46:39.060 --> 03:46:40.450
is difficult to make claims to national

03:46:40.460 --> 03:46:42.050
economies and their governments

03:46:42.060 --> 03:46:43.890
on the introduction of hidden measures.

03:46:44.570 --> 03:46:46.570
A special block of state

03:46:46.580 --> 03:46:48.250
regulation tools is financial

03:46:48.260 --> 03:46:50.170
measures of protectionism.

03:46:50.530 --> 03:46:51.930
The courts cover subsidies,

03:46:51.970 --> 03:46:54.830
loans and various types of sanctions,

03:46:54.840 --> 03:46:57.870
including these dumped.

03:46:58.030 --> 03:47:03.050
Macroeconomic measures can be classified

03:47:03.060 --> 03:47:05.790
as a separate group, and they can

03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:07.270
be classified as hidden protectionism

03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:08.630
measures.

03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:11.630
Macroeconomic policy is strongly

03:47:11.640 --> 03:47:13.930
interrelated with foreign economic

03:47:13.940 --> 03:47:16.350
policy, and therefore it is possible

03:47:16.360 --> 03:47:19.270
to replace some of the methods

03:47:19.280 --> 03:47:20.770
used within the framework of the

03:47:20.780 --> 03:47:23.270
tariff policy of the state with

03:47:23.430 --> 03:47:25.510
methods of credit-monetary

03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:28.150
or budget-tax policy.

03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:31.270
The last group is quantitative financial

03:47:31.280 --> 03:47:32.490
measures.

03:47:33.190 --> 03:47:36.210
This is a special group because it

03:47:36.220 --> 03:47:38.390
is related to economic sanctions.

03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:43.650
Economic sanctions are not considered

03:47:43.660 --> 03:47:45.570
to be a common measure

03:47:45.580 --> 03:47:47.010
of state regulation.

03:47:47.070 --> 03:47:51.210
Economic sanctions are introduced

03:47:51.220 --> 03:47:53.230
to solve political problems.

03:47:53.550 --> 03:47:57.550
Economic sanctions use methods

03:47:57.560 --> 03:48:00.050
that block export

03:48:00.060 --> 03:48:02.510
and import flows.

03:48:02.520 --> 03:48:04.550
Of course, they are also the subject

03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:06.730
of consideration of economic

03:48:06.740 --> 03:48:09.790
sciences and the consequences of

03:48:09.800 --> 03:48:11.210
economic sanctions.

03:48:11.550 --> 03:48:13.450
The methods of imposing sanctions

03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:18.890
are understood in the economic theory and

03:48:18.900 --> 03:48:19.930
in the theory of international

03:48:19.940 --> 03:48:21.230
economic relations.

03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:27.760
So, let’s go to the first group

03:48:29.550 --> 03:48:34.560
of protectionist measures – customs duties.

03:48:35.820 --> 03:48:39.440
Difference between the term duty and tariff.

03:48:40.600 --> 03:48:42.360
A duty is a certain tax

03:48:42.370 --> 03:48:43.960
that is levied when imported

03:48:43.970 --> 03:48:48.420
or exported goods are

03:48:48.430 --> 03:48:49.740
introduced.

03:48:50.840 --> 03:48:52.560
But since in relation to

03:48:52.570 --> 03:48:57.340
different groups of goods these

03:48:57.350 --> 03:48:59.100
duties are differentiated,

03:48:59.260 --> 03:49:01.140
vary, they are assembled

03:49:01.150 --> 03:49:03.840
in a table called the tariff.

03:49:04.180 --> 03:49:06.800
Similarly, a tariff, for example,

03:49:06.810 --> 03:49:08.940
wages, that is, it is a grid

03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:13.800
of different levels of wages

03:49:13.810 --> 03:49:16.020
for different types of activities.

03:49:16.180 --> 03:49:18.200
All customs duties are collected

03:49:18.210 --> 03:49:21.040
in a certain grid, which

03:49:21.050 --> 03:49:22.800
is called a tariff.

03:49:23.380 --> 03:49:25.520
This is why customs duties

03:49:25.530 --> 03:49:27.120
are tariff measures.

03:49:27.480 --> 03:49:29.340
What are the functions of customs duties?

03:49:29.400 --> 03:49:30.520
First of all, the fiscal.

03:49:31.100 --> 03:49:32.940
This is a means of distributing

03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:34.400
income.

03:49:34.920 --> 03:49:39.340
If fiscal goals are predominant,

03:49:39.350 --> 03:49:43.180
then such a tariff policy

03:49:43.190 --> 03:49:47.520
is not ideal.

03:49:47.920 --> 03:49:51.340
The state understands that the

03:49:51.350 --> 03:49:54.660
general development of the

03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:56.920
economy and international

03:49:56.930 --> 03:49:59.440
economic relations is a necessary

03:49:59.450 --> 03:50:01.740
component of modern

03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:04.120
economic development.

03:50:05.300 --> 03:50:06.780
Therefore, the fiscal goal

03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:09.360
is present, but for developed

03:50:09.370 --> 03:50:13.100
countries it is a secondary goal.

03:50:13.300 --> 03:50:16.020
But for transitional economies,

03:50:16.030 --> 03:50:18.100
which have recently experienced

03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:21.000
some financial problems, which

03:50:21.010 --> 03:50:23.160
have a trade deficit, which

03:50:23.170 --> 03:50:24.940
have a budget deficit, these

03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:28.880
countries, of course, use customs

03:50:29.080 --> 03:50:31.040
duties as a means of receiving

03:50:31.050 --> 03:50:33.820
tax payments and as a means

03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:38.180
of supplementing the budget.

03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:40.240
The next function,

03:50:40.260 --> 03:50:43.220
protectionist, in this case is

03:50:43.230 --> 03:50:44.840
assumed to help us protect

03:50:44.850 --> 03:50:47.080
certain industries from international

03:50:47.090 --> 03:50:48.440
competition and,

03:50:48.450 --> 03:50:50.700
accordingly, promote

03:50:50.710 --> 03:50:52.860
the development of

03:50:52.870 --> 03:50:55.160
certain industries.

03:50:55.380 --> 03:50:57.800
Ultimately, this type of protectionism

03:50:57.810 --> 03:51:00.000
helps to influence

03:51:00.010 --> 03:51:01.860
not the balance of payments.

03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:04.660
If we have a negative balance of payments

03:51:04.670 --> 03:51:06.680
and import flows too large and

03:51:06.690 --> 03:51:08.880
too pressure on domestic

03:51:08.890 --> 03:51:11.740
competition, on the state

03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:13.520
of the domestic national economy,,

03:51:13.530 --> 03:51:17.120
the maintenance of measures of

03:51:17.130 --> 03:51:19.040
protectionism to reduce imports

03:51:19.050 --> 03:51:20.880
in some certain period of

03:51:20.890 --> 03:51:25.380
time is quite acceptable.

03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:26.980
The next function,

03:51:27.020 --> 03:51:29.820
balancing, is assumed that exports

03:51:30.040 --> 03:51:32.820
and imports develop primarily

03:51:32.900 --> 03:51:35.160
from the discrepancy of supply

03:51:35.170 --> 03:51:37.460
and demand in the domestic market.

03:51:37.560 --> 03:51:40.240
If we have a deficit in the

03:51:40.250 --> 03:51:43.200
domestic market, then we must

03:51:43.520 --> 03:51:45.480
liberalize our foreign trade

03:51:45.490 --> 03:51:47.320
relations and expand

03:51:47.330 --> 03:51:48.800
the flow of imports.

03:51:49.100 --> 03:51:50.640
If, on the contrary, there is

03:51:50.650 --> 03:51:53.280
a situation of excess goods, then

03:51:53.290 --> 03:51:56.220
we must in no way promote the

03:51:56.230 --> 03:51:59.000
export of excess goods abroad.

03:52:00.140 --> 03:52:01.940
There are a number of key principles

03:52:01.950 --> 03:52:03.260
of tariff policy.

03:52:03.680 --> 03:52:06.060
First of all, this is the principle of tariff escalation.

03:52:06.560 --> 03:52:08.600
What does he mean?

03:52:09.060 --> 03:52:11.360
Of course, all countries,

03:52:11.370 --> 03:52:13.440
having limited resources and,

03:52:13.450 --> 03:52:15.080
above all, raw materials,

03:52:15.090 --> 03:52:18.280
are interested in driving

03:52:18.290 --> 03:52:19.540
raw materials on their

03:52:24.580 --> 03:52:26.520
territory, which suggests that

03:52:26.530 --> 03:52:29.740
for some raw materials

03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:32.940
tariffs are quite low or cancelled,

03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:34.800
depending on the

03:52:34.810 --> 03:52:36.020
economic situation that

03:52:36.030 --> 03:52:37.520
develops within the

03:52:37.530 --> 03:52:39.700
national economy.

03:52:40.440 --> 03:52:42.260
If we import finished products,

03:52:42.270 --> 03:52:44.180
the higher the degree of processing

03:52:44.190 --> 03:52:45.880
of this finished product, the higher

03:52:45.940 --> 03:52:47.980
the tariff barriers.

03:52:48.100 --> 03:52:50.180
In particular, for components,

03:52:50.190 --> 03:52:51.800
which are then used in national

03:52:51.810 --> 03:52:54.340
production to assemble finished

03:52:54.350 --> 03:52:56.540
products on the territory

03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:58.260
of the national economy, tariffs

03:52:58.580 --> 03:53:00.960
are usually lower than for finished

03:53:00.970 --> 03:53:02.100
products.

03:53:02.760 --> 03:53:04.100
The simplest example.

03:53:04.600 --> 03:53:06.200
The tariffs for components for computers

03:53:06.210 --> 03:53:09.340
are lower than the tariffs for importing

03:53:09.350 --> 03:53:12.360
ready-made computers from other

03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:16.070
countries.

03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:18.050
The optimal rate.

03:53:18.060 --> 03:53:19.070
What is this principle?

03:53:19.530 --> 03:53:20.890
This principle is more

03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:22.870
theoretical than practical.

03:53:23.810 --> 03:53:29.090
It was developed in the institutions

03:53:29.100 --> 03:53:32.330
of the European Union when they discussed

03:53:32.340 --> 03:53:34.870
the question of what tariffs should

03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:36.490
be, what should be the system of protectionist

03:53:36.500 --> 03:53:39.510
measures within the European Union.

03:53:40.110 --> 03:53:43.590
The optimal rate is the rate that

03:53:43.870 --> 03:53:46.390
does not maximize taxes in the choice.

03:53:46.470 --> 03:53:48.030
The optimal rate is not one

03:53:48.230 --> 03:53:51.110
that allows to perform the fiscal

03:53:51.120 --> 03:53:52.650
function of the tariff.

03:53:52.660 --> 03:53:54.750
The optimal tariff is one that does not deteriorate

03:53:54.760 --> 03:53:57.190
the situation of national consumers, does

03:53:57.200 --> 03:53:59.810
not deteriorate the indicators

03:53:59.820 --> 03:54:05.570
of economic growth of the country.

03:54:05.930 --> 03:54:07.950
To some extent, the idea of an optimal

03:54:07.960 --> 03:54:09.930
tariff is generally a theoretical

03:54:09.940 --> 03:54:11.970
idea, but nevertheless this

03:54:11.980 --> 03:54:15.110
idea was used in the

03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:16.610
development of a system of protectionist

03:54:16.620 --> 03:54:19.610
measures in Western Europe.

03:54:21.100 --> 03:54:23.160
What is the classification of customs duties?

03:54:23.760 --> 03:54:27.080
We can divide them into at

03:54:27.090 --> 03:54:28.420
least three groups.

03:54:28.740 --> 03:54:31.040
First of all, the way of interplay.

03:54:31.240 --> 03:54:32.760
Two large taxes.

03:54:32.840 --> 03:54:35.400
The name add value in this case is

03:54:35.410 --> 03:54:37.580
a tax, which is imposed based

03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:40.080
on the value of the goods, that

03:54:40.090 --> 03:54:43.520
is, a tax on the price of the goods.

03:54:43.530 --> 03:54:44.560
specifically.

03:54:44.880 --> 03:54:46.480
In this case, it is assumed that when

03:54:46.680 --> 03:54:50.480
collecting the tax it is imposed

03:54:50.490 --> 03:54:52.600
based on the physiological

03:54:52.610 --> 03:54:54.140
characteristics of the goods, its

03:54:54.150 --> 03:54:57.440
specifics, that is, on tons, on square

03:54:57.450 --> 03:55:01.520
meters, on liters, for example,

03:55:01.530 --> 03:55:03.600
the volume of the engine and

03:55:03.610 --> 03:55:04.820
so on.

03:55:04.830 --> 03:55:06.900
Combined duties are the duties

03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:08.460
that use both the first

03:55:08.470 --> 03:55:11.020
and second principle.

03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:17.100
When a interest tax is declared on

03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:20.560
the import of some goods and at the same

03:55:20.570 --> 03:55:23.240
time it is indicated that the total

03:55:23.250 --> 03:55:25.820
value of the tax collected must

03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:28.160
not exceed, for example, 5 euros

03:55:28.170 --> 03:55:30.160
per tonne.

03:55:30.940 --> 03:55:33.960
According to the object of the appendix,

03:55:33.970 --> 03:55:35.780
customs duties are divided into import,

03:55:35.860 --> 03:55:37.840
export and transit duties.

03:55:38.060 --> 03:55:40.040
As you can see, in this case, the flow

03:55:40.050 --> 03:55:43.120
is expected to be accounted for.

03:55:44.020 --> 03:55:47.000
Of course, in the world community,

03:55:47.010 --> 03:55:49.120
first of all customs duties

03:55:49.130 --> 03:55:52.520
on import flow are retained.

03:55:55.520 --> 03:56:00.320
The reasons for this method of introducing

03:56:00.330 --> 03:56:02.380
import duties have already been considered.

03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:04.980
This is the export flow.

03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:07.780
The developed countries are not

03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:10.260
trying to raise the price of their exports.

03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:12.580
Export taxes are not usually

03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:15.380
applied in developed countries.

03:56:15.440 --> 03:56:17.440
For example, under U.S. legislation, there

03:56:17.450 --> 03:56:21.060
are no tariff restrictions on U.S. exports.

03:56:21.960 --> 03:56:23.500
But on the other hand, if we take,

03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:26.140
let’s say, Russia’s example,

03:56:26.150 --> 03:56:27.440
we know that we have export

03:56:27.450 --> 03:56:31.800
duties on exports of oil and

03:56:31.810 --> 03:56:33.720
gas, that is, energy.

03:56:34.220 --> 03:56:36.840
The purpose of such export duties,

03:56:37.440 --> 03:56:39.340
of course, is to impose such duties

03:56:39.350 --> 03:56:40.900
only if the world market conditions

03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:42.680
are such that prices of these

03:56:42.690 --> 03:56:45.200
export goods are rising.

03:56:45.400 --> 03:56:47.480
And of course, the excess

03:56:47.490 --> 03:56:49.160
income that export firms

03:56:49.170 --> 03:56:52.260
receive from energy exports,

03:56:52.270 --> 03:56:54.740
they are redistributed

03:56:54.750 --> 03:56:56.360
to the budget in favor

03:56:56.370 --> 03:56:57.200
of the state.

03:56:57.820 --> 03:56:59.040
Therefore, the purpose of such

03:56:59.050 --> 03:57:01.720
export duties is a redistributive

03:57:01.730 --> 03:57:02.860
fiscal function.

03:57:03.740 --> 03:57:06.120
Furthermore, in general, our

03:57:06.130 --> 03:57:07.800
domestic consumers are also interested,

03:57:07.810 --> 03:57:09.600
especially in the summer, in the

03:57:09.610 --> 03:57:10.840
rail-to-business country in the

03:57:10.850 --> 03:57:13.020
consumption of energy.

03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:14.880
Accordingly, in order to in this period

03:57:14.890 --> 03:57:16.020
of time somehow contain the

03:57:16.030 --> 03:57:19.460
flow of these goods on export,

03:57:19.470 --> 03:57:21.300
given that domestic prices for

03:57:21.310 --> 03:57:23.120
energy sources are usually contained,

03:57:23.130 --> 03:57:24.700
and lower, less advantageous

03:57:24.780 --> 03:57:26.380
to the exporter.

03:57:26.500 --> 03:57:27.900
So, the introduction of export

03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:30.100
duties allows to regulate these flows

03:57:30.110 --> 03:57:32.780
and protect the national already

03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:36.280
consumer and the deficit, one

03:57:36.290 --> 03:57:38.360
can say, or very important products

03:57:38.370 --> 03:57:40.840
to reorient to the domestic

03:57:40.850 --> 03:57:41.880
market.

03:57:42.040 --> 03:57:44.040
Transit duties are usually

03:57:44.050 --> 03:57:46.580
levied for the movement of goods

03:57:46.590 --> 03:57:48.200
from one country to another through

03:57:48.210 --> 03:57:51.020
the economic territory of a country.

03:57:51.240 --> 03:57:52.980
Transit duties are usually excluded

03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:55.340
from the developed countries.

03:57:56.040 --> 03:57:57.460
But, despite this, developing

03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:02.580
countries, transit duties are

03:58:02.590 --> 03:58:04.860
a means of supplementing the budget.

03:58:06.860 --> 03:58:09.140
Belarus transit duties on the

03:58:09.150 --> 03:58:11.680
export of Russian gas, Ukraine

03:58:11.690 --> 03:58:13.300
and so on.

03:58:14.420 --> 03:58:16.000
Often, of course, there are big

03:58:16.010 --> 03:58:17.620
disputes over transit duties, but in

03:58:17.700 --> 03:58:20.860
this national economy they replenish

03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:22.360
their budget at the expense of

03:58:22.370 --> 03:58:23.340
transit duties.

03:58:23.350 --> 03:58:25.640
According to the nature of the impact, the

03:58:25.650 --> 03:58:27.020
duties are divided into

03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:29.880
seasonal, compensatory, anti-dumping.

03:58:29.960 --> 03:58:32.780
Seasonal duties are usually imposed

03:58:33.160 --> 03:58:35.480
on goods according to supply

03:58:35.490 --> 03:58:37.060
and demand during a certain

03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:38.060
season.

03:58:38.400 --> 03:58:40.680
In the summer, seasonal duties

03:58:40.690 --> 03:58:41.980
may be imposed on imports

03:58:41.990 --> 03:58:45.100
of whole-food products in

03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:47.040
order to protect national

03:58:47.050 --> 03:58:48.640
whole-food producers.

03:58:49.040 --> 03:58:52.900
Compensation duties, like anti-

03:58:52.910 --> 03:58:57.320
dumping duties, are protective

03:58:57.330 --> 03:58:59.320
measures.

03:59:00.540 --> 03:59:03.380
If, suppose, the state has found

03:59:03.390 --> 03:59:05.680
out, the government has found

03:59:05.690 --> 03:59:07.200
out, or some other economic agents

03:59:07.210 --> 03:59:09.220
have found out, that in this

03:59:09.230 --> 03:59:12.560
case the export to the country

03:59:12.570 --> 03:59:15.940
is supported by financial support

03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:18.640
of some other measures, then

03:59:18.650 --> 03:59:20.720
this state against such

03:59:20.730 --> 03:59:23.160
other government-supported

03:59:23.170 --> 03:59:24.600
exports can carry out

03:59:24.610 --> 03:59:26.320
counter-compensation

03:59:26.330 --> 03:59:27.600
duties.

03:59:27.620 --> 03:59:29.480
Of course, then the trade war begins, and,

03:59:29.490 --> 03:59:31.780
in general, it is better to go to

03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:34.320
the coordination of their positions

03:59:34.330 --> 03:59:38.120
and, in general, to mutually

03:59:38.130 --> 03:59:40.300
reduce these flows, and then compensatory

03:59:40.310 --> 03:59:42.960
duties can not be introduced.

03:59:43.120 --> 03:59:44.880
The anti-dumping duties, again,

03:59:44.890 --> 03:59:46.840
are aimed at punishing those firms

03:59:46.850 --> 03:59:48.740
that try to introduce imports

03:59:48.750 --> 03:59:50.660
at underpriced prices

03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:52.100
in order to seize the

03:59:52.110 --> 03:59:53.640
domestic market.

03:59:56.230 --> 03:59:58.390
What are the strengths and weaknesses

03:59:58.730 --> 04:00:02.290
of the methods of collecting tariffs?

04:00:02.300 --> 04:00:03.730
Dwarf duties.

04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:05.670
When charged, they have one

04:00:05.680 --> 04:00:06.490
positive effect.

04:00:06.570 --> 04:00:07.890
They maintain the same level of protection

04:00:07.900 --> 04:00:09.450
of the internal market in the event

04:00:09.460 --> 04:00:10.470
of price changes.

04:00:11.250 --> 04:00:11.830
and Negative.

04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:13.310
customs assessment of the

04:00:13.320 --> 04:00:14.730
value of goods.

04:00:15.610 --> 04:00:19.490
Of course, the importer, offering to

04:00:19.500 --> 04:00:21.410
our national market a product

04:00:21.530 --> 04:00:23.790
that is taxed by value, tries in

04:00:24.250 --> 04:00:26.230
various ways to lower this

04:00:26.240 --> 04:00:28.750
value and a whole system

04:00:28.760 --> 04:00:30.630
of measures is being developed

04:00:30.640 --> 04:00:33.310
in modern law, as it can be verified,

04:00:33.320 --> 04:00:35.670
to re-evaluate the value

04:00:35.680 --> 04:00:36.870
of goods.

04:00:38.270 --> 04:00:39.670
specific duties.

04:00:40.310 --> 04:00:42.110
They are very simple in administration.

04:00:42.310 --> 04:00:44.430
It is clear that if you take a tax per

04:00:44.440 --> 04:00:47.390
cubic meter or per square meter, for

04:00:47.400 --> 04:00:49.590
the weight of something, then they

04:00:49.600 --> 04:00:51.450
are enough to simply enter.

04:00:51.930 --> 04:00:54.610
But the level of protection of

04:00:54.620 --> 04:00:57.530
these specific duties is heavily dependent

04:00:57.540 --> 04:00:59.730
on fluctuations in global prices.

04:01:00.450 --> 04:01:03.750
And in this case, if you drive a

04:01:03.760 --> 04:01:06.410
good that is quite cheap on the

04:01:06.420 --> 04:01:08.390
world market, and you only charge

04:01:08.400 --> 04:01:11.110
the duties from a tonne or another

04:01:11.120 --> 04:01:13.570
physical unit, then, of course,

04:01:13.580 --> 04:01:15.270
you do not curb this flow, because

04:01:15.280 --> 04:01:17.010
the demand for such goods in

04:01:17.020 --> 04:01:18.570
the domestic market will increase,

04:01:18.580 --> 04:01:21.250
and these goods will be

04:01:21.260 --> 04:01:23.110
competitive for

04:01:23.120 --> 04:01:24.470
national producers.

04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:27.810
What about the tariff quota?

04:01:29.430 --> 04:01:33.490
A tariff quota implies that the tax

04:01:33.500 --> 04:01:37.570
is raised after the agreed volume

04:01:37.580 --> 04:01:40.670
of imports has already been imported

04:01:40.680 --> 04:01:43.790
into the national territory.

04:01:44.190 --> 04:01:45.310
What does this mean?

04:01:45.610 --> 04:01:48.470
Suppose we decided to bring 20 tons.

04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:51.470
The tariff quota says that

04:01:51.480 --> 04:01:53.750
if you drive 10 tons, the

04:01:53.760 --> 04:01:54.990
tax is 2%.

04:01:55.000 --> 04:01:56.890
But if you drive something above

04:01:56.900 --> 04:02:00.370
10 tons, then the ton becomes 15%.

04:02:00.380 --> 04:02:02.250
This is the method of tariff quota.

04:02:02.910 --> 04:02:05.910
What are the advantages of tariff quotas?

04:02:06.230 --> 04:02:07.750
This is not a physical restriction

04:02:07.760 --> 04:02:09.750
on exports or imports.

04:02:09.760 --> 04:02:10.630


04:02:11.470 --> 04:02:14.430
It is assumed that firms that still

04:02:14.440 --> 04:02:16.490
want to seize the national

04:02:16.500 --> 04:02:18.070
market or somehow strengthen

04:02:18.080 --> 04:02:21.130
themselves on it will agree to

04:02:21.140 --> 04:02:24.910
pay a higher tax and import the

04:02:24.920 --> 04:02:27.190
products they decided to offer

04:02:27.200 --> 04:02:29.610
to the national consumer.

04:02:29.690 --> 04:02:32.070
The external trade flow is not completely

04:02:32.080 --> 04:02:32.870
closed.

04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:34.530
This is of course the strong side of

04:02:34.540 --> 04:02:35.630
the tariff quota.

04:02:37.380 --> 04:02:40.850
quantitative measures of foreign trade.

04:02:41.170 --> 04:02:43.230
This is a large block of measures.

04:02:44.230 --> 04:02:45.930
These include the most common

04:02:45.940 --> 04:02:47.090
quantitative restrictions,

04:02:47.100 --> 04:02:49.370
such as quotas, licensing,

04:02:49.610 --> 04:02:51.930
import contingentation, anti-

04:02:51.940 --> 04:02:54.270
dumping duties, compensatory

04:02:54.410 --> 04:02:56.190
duties and voluntary

04:02:56.200 --> 04:02:58.370
export restrictions, as well

04:02:58.490 --> 04:03:01.570
as compensatory fees.

04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:05.870
Quotas are the measures against

04:03:05.880 --> 04:03:09.790
which, first of all, agreements

04:03:09.800 --> 04:03:12.090
within the World Trade Organization

04:03:12.100 --> 04:03:13.210
revolt.

04:03:13.250 --> 04:03:13.510
Why is?

04:03:13.590 --> 04:03:15.050
Because quotas are a physical limitation

04:03:15.060 --> 04:03:16.810
of export and import flows,

04:03:16.820 --> 04:03:19.370
and more than a certain volume

04:03:19.380 --> 04:03:22.030
can not be imported or exported.

04:03:22.350 --> 04:03:24.610
However, even developed countries in the

04:03:24.620 --> 04:03:26.110
world are also using quotas.

04:03:26.410 --> 04:03:27.690
This is mainly about

04:03:27.700 --> 04:03:30.050
agricultural products or imports

04:03:30.060 --> 04:03:32.130
of textiles or metals

04:03:32.140 --> 04:03:33.730
in these countries.

04:03:34.850 --> 04:03:36.970
Russia imports metals to

04:03:36.980 --> 04:03:40.730
Germany under the quota.

04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:43.310
Of course, these arrangements for introducing

04:03:43.320 --> 04:03:46.870
quotas are based on intergovernmental

04:03:46.880 --> 04:03:48.510
agreements.

04:03:48.930 --> 04:03:50.450
However, such physical restrictions

04:03:50.460 --> 04:03:52.170
on export and import

04:03:52.180 --> 04:03:53.470
flows exist.

04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:58.910
Licensing is also a form

04:03:58.920 --> 04:04:00.390
of physical restriction

04:04:00.400 --> 04:04:03.250
of foreign trade flows, as

04:04:03.260 --> 04:04:06.310
it involves limited

04:04:06.320 --> 04:04:07.290
licensing.

04:04:07.300 --> 04:04:08.970
What a company, what not.

04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:11.050
That is, it is assumed that

04:04:11.060 --> 04:04:13.930
licenses can be issued for

04:04:13.940 --> 04:04:15.770
a limited amount of export-

04:04:15.780 --> 04:04:18.170
import operations.

04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:19.870
However, licenses can be general,

04:04:19.880 --> 04:04:21.970
and then the physical restriction

04:04:21.980 --> 04:04:24.650
of the licensed

04:04:24.660 --> 04:04:27.070
product does not occur.

04:04:27.150 --> 04:04:29.570
Licenses are usually introduced

04:04:29.580 --> 04:04:31.770
for the export of gold, diamonds

04:04:31.780 --> 04:04:34.530
and other rare goods, to either

04:04:34.540 --> 04:04:37.310
limit its importation or, so to

04:04:37.320 --> 04:04:40.570
speak, limit its importation, as

04:04:40.690 --> 04:04:45.270
the demand situation of supply

04:04:45.280 --> 04:04:48.170
in the domestic market of

04:04:48.180 --> 04:04:51.090
the economies of countries changes.

04:04:52.370 --> 04:04:55.250
Import Quota This complex name

04:04:55.260 --> 04:04:56.930
is associated with seasonal

04:04:56.940 --> 04:04:58.610
quotas.

04:04:58.910 --> 04:05:00.430
That is, a certain contingent of

04:05:00.440 --> 04:05:02.010
goods, a certain list of goods

04:05:02.020 --> 04:05:05.110
are subject to physical restrictions

04:05:05.120 --> 04:05:07.830
on import or export.

04:05:08.490 --> 04:05:10.570
I have already mentioned anti-dumping

04:05:10.580 --> 04:05:12.150
compensatory duties.

04:05:12.490 --> 04:05:16.710
They are related to the fact that

04:05:16.720 --> 04:05:19.690
when countries are not interested

04:05:19.700 --> 04:05:24.370
in importing some goods at too cheap

04:05:24.380 --> 04:05:26.250
prices or cheap prices are due to

04:05:26.430 --> 04:05:28.090
the fact that this export is supported

04:05:28.100 --> 04:05:31.190
by different methods by the financial

04:05:31.200 --> 04:05:34.610
government of other countries,

04:05:34.810 --> 04:05:37.770
then these anti-dumping compensatory

04:05:37.780 --> 04:05:40.390
duties are considered fair

04:05:40.400 --> 04:05:43.050
and imposed on the basis

04:05:43.060 --> 04:05:46.830
of court proceedings.

04:05:46.840 --> 04:05:48.790
Because in principle, it is impossible

04:05:48.800 --> 04:05:50.470
to introduce an anti-dumping compensatory

04:05:50.480 --> 04:05:52.730
duty without sufficiently fully

04:05:52.740 --> 04:05:54.870
considering the problem.

04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:58.410
It is necessary to take into account

04:05:58.420 --> 04:06:01.250
the position of the parties, why this

04:06:01.260 --> 04:06:03.250
price was so underwritten or why

04:06:03.260 --> 04:06:05.850
one or another tax was introduced.

04:06:06.190 --> 04:06:08.050
Voluntary restrictions on exports.

04:06:08.170 --> 04:06:09.470
Volunteer in the cages.

04:06:09.480 --> 04:06:09.910
Why is?

04:06:10.010 --> 04:06:12.010
Because it is assumed that a country

04:06:12.020 --> 04:06:13.330
that imposes voluntary export

04:06:13.340 --> 04:06:16.910
restrictions as a result of negotiations

04:06:16.920 --> 04:06:19.110
with its counterparty with another

04:06:19.120 --> 04:06:21.710
country understands that if it

04:06:21.720 --> 04:06:23.810
does not voluntarily restrict

04:06:23.820 --> 04:06:25.670
its exports, various restrictive

04:06:25.680 --> 04:06:28.650
measures in the form of quotas,

04:06:28.660 --> 04:06:30.850
licenses or even compensatory

04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:34.570
duties will be imposed against it.

04:06:34.580 --> 04:06:36.690
Voluntary export restriction is

04:06:36.700 --> 04:06:39.310
usually introduced when the

04:06:39.320 --> 04:06:42.190
country of the importer has

04:06:42.200 --> 04:06:44.810
a negative trade balance with

04:06:44.820 --> 04:06:46.290
the country, that is,

04:06:46.300 --> 04:06:48.170
strong import flows.

04:06:48.410 --> 04:06:49.830
Such a voluntary restriction of

04:06:49.840 --> 04:06:51.650
exports exists in Russia with many

04:06:51.660 --> 04:06:53.390
Western European countries on exports

04:06:53.400 --> 04:06:56.710
of metals, in Japan the United States

04:06:56.720 --> 04:07:00.170
on exports of Japanese annual products

04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:05.340
In the same series of quantitative

04:07:05.350 --> 04:07:07.500
restrictions are compensatory fees,

04:07:07.510 --> 04:07:09.600
because they are the higher,

04:07:09.610 --> 04:07:14.960
the more proven some export-stimulating

04:07:14.970 --> 04:07:18.740
measures, which were introduced

04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:22.280
earlier by importers, so

04:07:22.290 --> 04:07:25.720
their price of their goods

04:07:25.730 --> 04:07:28.140
is cheaper.

04:07:29.040 --> 04:07:30.520
There are different ways to

04:07:30.530 --> 04:07:32.320
distribute licenses.

04:07:32.680 --> 04:07:34.340
First of all, it is a competitive

04:07:34.350 --> 04:07:36.280
basis.

04:07:36.360 --> 04:07:37.860
The second option is the system of

04:07:37.870 --> 04:07:39.400
clear preferences, the third option

04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:42.060
is the investment-based competition.

04:07:42.560 --> 04:07:45.100
Auction-concurrency basis is

04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:46.500
the most preferred option, because

04:07:46.860 --> 04:07:50.780
in this case those who are trying

04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:52.440
to obtain a license for export

04:07:52.450 --> 04:07:56.000
or import, they compete

04:07:56.010 --> 04:08:00.980
within the offer to buy licenses,

04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:03.720
and accordingly the

04:08:03.730 --> 04:08:05.380
state benefits from

04:08:05.390 --> 04:08:08.660
the sale of such an investment

04:08:08.670 --> 04:08:10.420
agreement.

04:08:11.180 --> 04:08:13.440
If we have a system of obvious preferences,

04:08:13.450 --> 04:08:15.500
then it is usually applied by

04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:17.060
the government in the event that they

04:08:19.110 --> 04:08:21.080
are already permanent counterparties,

04:08:21.090 --> 04:08:22.560
and the firms have established

04:08:22.570 --> 04:08:24.860
themselves on the good side, and

04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:27.680
therefore competitions do not occur

04:08:27.690 --> 04:08:30.300
here, and the invitation or distribution

04:08:30.310 --> 04:08:32.940
of licenses is carried

04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:35.640
out directly by officials.

04:08:35.920 --> 04:08:38.440
Competition on a price basis is also

04:08:38.450 --> 04:08:39.920
a significant form of distribution

04:08:39.930 --> 04:08:41.940
of licenses, since it is assumed

04:08:41.950 --> 04:08:43.840
that the main parameter

04:08:43.850 --> 04:08:47.480
of victory in this competition

04:08:47.490 --> 04:08:51.000
is the price characteristics

04:08:51.010 --> 04:08:53.160
of products.

04:08:53.480 --> 04:08:56.200
Now let’s look at the types of export support.

04:08:56.620 --> 04:08:58.020
First of all, it is a direct

04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:59.600
stimulation of exports.

04:09:00.120 --> 04:09:03.080
It is assumed that the state part

04:09:03.090 --> 04:09:05.320
of the budget is distributed,

04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:06.600
for example, by agricultural

04:09:06.610 --> 04:09:09.000
producers, and moreover, for

04:09:09.400 --> 04:09:11.820
example, in the European Union,

04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:16.000
some import taxes after their

04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:18.180
fees on target programs

04:09:18.440 --> 04:09:19.720
are redistributed by the

04:09:19.730 --> 04:09:20.340
producer of

04:09:20.350 --> 04:09:22.380
agricultural products.

04:09:22.860 --> 04:09:24.260
Export subsidies for agricultural

04:09:24.270 --> 04:09:25.920
products, again, are quite difficult

04:09:26.020 --> 04:09:27.620
to de-flood, because the motivation

04:09:27.630 --> 04:09:33.260
of these subsidies is related

04:09:33.270 --> 04:09:36.900
to the fact that the domestic

04:09:36.910 --> 04:09:38.640
national economy is

04:09:38.650 --> 04:09:40.100
supported and, accordingly,

04:09:40.110 --> 04:09:42.360
the domestic sector,

04:09:42.370 --> 04:09:43.700
such as agriculture

04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:47.220
or some engineering industry.

04:09:48.040 --> 04:09:51.020
Indirect stimulation of exports.

04:09:51.060 --> 04:09:52.840
This is primarily related

04:09:52.850 --> 04:09:57.620
to various types of financial support.

04:09:57.780 --> 04:10:00.300
For example, the preferential export loans.

04:10:00.440 --> 04:10:01.980
The benefit is granted both

04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:04.620
on terms and rates of loans and

04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:06.520
on sources of funds.

04:10:07.500 --> 04:10:09.780
Financial assistance to developing countries.

04:10:09.790 --> 04:10:12.040
This is a form that is

04:10:12.050 --> 04:10:14.400
used by developed countries.

04:10:14.460 --> 04:10:17.280
It is expected that the financial

04:10:17.290 --> 04:10:19.340
assistance that will be provided

04:10:19.350 --> 04:10:21.540
to these countries will then be spent

04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:24.380
on buying the goods that

04:10:24.580 --> 04:10:25.780
will be exported from these developed

04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:26.880
countries.

04:10:28.160 --> 04:10:30.700
Again, the motivation for such

04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:33.320
financial assistance is related

04:10:33.330 --> 04:10:36.800
to social issues and to prove

04:10:36.810 --> 04:10:40.000
the interest of exporters.

04:10:40.000 --> 04:10:42.350
The next form

04:10:42.360 --> 04:10:44.030
is public insurance.

04:10:44.090 --> 04:10:47.050
It is also developed to no greater

04:10:47.060 --> 04:10:50.830
extent in developed countries,

04:10:50.840 --> 04:10:52.550
when the state legally insures,

04:10:52.560 --> 04:10:57.350
guarantees export firms from

04:10:57.360 --> 04:11:00.290
various risks in the territory

04:11:00.300 --> 04:11:02.730
of different countries.

04:11:03.150 --> 04:11:05.030
This can be insurance of loans,

04:11:05.040 --> 04:11:10.130
political risks, and not just

04:11:10.140 --> 04:11:12.890
risks associated with weather

04:11:12.900 --> 04:11:14.850
conditions, which are likely

04:11:14.860 --> 04:11:17.350
to be insured by private

04:11:17.360 --> 04:11:19.210
firms.

04:11:19.270 --> 04:11:23.550
Internal tax benefits.

04:11:24.450 --> 04:11:26.630
In this case, it is a strongly

04:11:26.640 --> 04:11:29.350
hidden form of support for

04:11:29.360 --> 04:11:32.870
exports, since domestic

04:11:32.880 --> 04:11:34.310
tax benefits can

04:11:34.320 --> 04:11:36.850
extend to a large number

04:11:36.860 --> 04:11:39.730
of types of commodity products.

04:11:40.390 --> 04:11:43.010
Again, it is difficult to

04:11:43.020 --> 04:11:45.710
prove that these tax benefits

04:11:45.720 --> 04:11:48.850
were aimed at supporting exporters,

04:11:48.860 --> 04:11:50.570
not the development of

04:11:50.580 --> 04:11:52.310
national sectors of

04:11:52.320 --> 04:11:53.890
the economy.

04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:57.830
Organizational and information assistance.

04:11:57.840 --> 04:11:59.410
In this case, it is assumed that

04:11:59.420 --> 04:12:01.050
the state can subsidize

04:12:01.060 --> 04:12:03.470
or finance the organization

04:12:03.480 --> 04:12:05.750
of exhibitions, international

04:12:06.010 --> 04:12:07.870
salons.

04:12:08.270 --> 04:12:10.310
Of course, firms that provide

04:12:10.320 --> 04:12:13.110
their goods and protect the honor

04:12:13.120 --> 04:12:17.090
of the country at these exhibitions,

04:12:17.100 --> 04:12:20.710
receive additional information about

04:12:20.720 --> 04:12:23.330
possible competitors and about possible

04:12:23.340 --> 04:12:27.470
innovations that are introduced

04:12:27.480 --> 04:12:30.750
by foreign firms - competitors.

04:12:33.640 --> 04:12:35.440
The international export control

04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:41.260
system developed mainly during

04:12:41.270 --> 04:12:42.980
the Cold War.

04:12:43.240 --> 04:12:45.020
In particular, the example I give

04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:47.520
you is the existence of

04:12:47.530 --> 04:12:49.140
a multilateral export

04:12:49.150 --> 04:12:51.320
control correlation committee

04:12:51.330 --> 04:12:52.960
COCOM.

04:12:52.970 --> 04:12:55.740
This committee existed within NATO

04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:56.940
countries.

04:12:58.800 --> 04:13:01.500
And within this committee,

04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:04.160
programs were developed for

04:13:05.630 --> 04:13:07.380
arms control, for control

04:13:07.390 --> 04:13:11.000
of nuclear energy production

04:13:11.010 --> 04:13:14.980
and also for control of production

04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:17.260
of industrial goods.

04:13:17.740 --> 04:13:20.980
It must be said that in the present

04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:24.600
conditions, each country has

04:13:24.610 --> 04:13:27.320
developed laws, legislative

04:13:27.360 --> 04:13:29.380
acts that allow outside the

04:13:29.390 --> 04:13:33.120
framework of COCOM to exercise

04:13:33.160 --> 04:13:36.700
such international control.

04:13:37.380 --> 04:13:40.740
In particular, it is possible

04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:42.780
that in the context of integration

04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:45.880
cooperation between countries often,

04:13:45.890 --> 04:13:47.460
although measures may be directed

04:13:47.470 --> 04:13:49.280
against some particular country

04:13:49.290 --> 04:13:51.100
for some political purposes,

04:13:51.500 --> 04:13:52.820
often third independent countries

04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:54.440
can suffer.

04:13:54.700 --> 04:13:57.960
In this case, the example that I would

04:13:57.970 --> 04:14:00.120
like to consider here is the production

04:14:00.130 --> 04:14:03.660
of a military aircraft in Russia.

04:14:04.400 --> 04:14:08.760
Suppliers of components and systems

04:14:08.770 --> 04:14:11.280
for this aircraft are a number of Western

04:14:11.290 --> 04:14:13.040
European countries.

04:14:13.180 --> 04:14:15.780
However, as part of the monitoring

04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:19.500
of the transfer of military technology

04:14:19.510 --> 04:14:23.720
in the United States banned a number

04:14:23.730 --> 04:14:25.880
of companies of Western European

04:14:25.890 --> 04:14:28.600
countries to export components for the

04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:30.880
production of such aircraft.

04:14:31.420 --> 04:14:32.940
The sanctions imposed by the

04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:35.420
US government on Sukhoi in connection

04:14:35.430 --> 04:14:37.800
with the issue of arms

04:14:39.800 --> 04:14:43.200
supplies to Iran were lifted

04:14:43.210 --> 04:14:46.820
in autumn 2006.

04:14:49.560 --> 04:14:51.680
However, pressure and influence

04:14:51.690 --> 04:14:56.660
have been put on the suppliers of

04:14:56.670 --> 04:14:58.940
the countries that supply for the

04:14:58.950 --> 04:15:06.240
production of the military aircraft "Deskjet".

04:15:06.250 --> 04:15:07.540
The modern characteristics

04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:08.720
of export control.

04:15:10.660 --> 04:15:15.260
First of all, in modern conditions

04:15:15.270 --> 04:15:17.740
there has been a transition from

04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:20.800
control over exports of goods to control

04:15:20.810 --> 04:15:23.260
over exports of strategically

04:15:23.270 --> 04:15:25.580
important technologies.

04:15:26.680 --> 04:15:28.920
Moreover, the main orientation of

04:15:28.930 --> 04:15:31.960
such control is switched to competitive

04:15:31.970 --> 04:15:33.820
preventive measures within the

04:15:34.240 --> 04:15:36.700
framework of international negotiations

04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:39.660
and international agreements.

04:15:39.960 --> 04:15:43.000
The fight against industrial espionage is on the rise.

04:15:44.260 --> 04:15:45.780
Moreover, there is a differentiation

04:15:45.790 --> 04:15:48.400
of countries in the degree of

04:15:48.410 --> 04:15:50.960
access to high technologies.

04:15:51.060 --> 04:15:53.160
Of course, getting on such a blacklist

04:15:53.170 --> 04:15:59.680
is not a good option for

04:16:00.080 --> 04:16:02.460
those countries in transition that

04:16:02.470 --> 04:16:05.820
are developing their exports

04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:07.420
and imports.

04:16:07.880 --> 04:16:11.140
Export controls are primarily

04:16:12.660 --> 04:16:15.080
carried out in relation to new

04:16:15.090 --> 04:16:17.300
goods and high-tech products.

04:16:17.360 --> 04:16:20.400
As soon as these technologies

04:16:20.410 --> 04:16:21.800
and commodities become more

04:16:21.810 --> 04:16:23.460
prevalent in the international

04:16:28.820 --> 04:16:30.380
question of economic

04:16:30.390 --> 04:16:31.580
sanctions.

04:16:31.640 --> 04:16:33.380
I have said that economic sanctions

04:16:33.390 --> 04:16:36.720
are a form of continuation

04:16:36.730 --> 04:16:39.700
of political relations.

04:16:40.700 --> 04:16:43.000
The ultimate case of modern

04:16:43.010 --> 04:16:45.480
political relations is military

04:16:45.490 --> 04:16:46.620
action.

04:16:47.120 --> 04:16:49.940
Before the introduction of military

04:16:49.950 --> 04:16:52.020
action as part of economic threat,

04:16:52.030 --> 04:16:53.360
some countries impose

04:16:53.370 --> 04:16:54.960
economic sanctions.

04:16:55.300 --> 04:16:58.580
These sanctions have the greatest

04:16:58.590 --> 04:17:01.020
effect and effectiveness if they are

04:17:01.030 --> 04:17:02.780
imposed on all international communities

04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:05.240
within the framework of UN agreements,

04:17:05.420 --> 04:17:08.280
not on individual countries.

04:17:08.420 --> 04:17:10.260
However, many countries resort

04:17:10.270 --> 04:17:12.120
to economic sanctions as a preventive

04:17:12.130 --> 04:17:14.660
measure to address

04:17:14.670 --> 04:17:16.800
political problems.

04:17:17.680 --> 04:17:19.580
In this case, the leader

04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:21.500
in the introduction of sanctions

04:17:21.780 --> 04:17:22.860
is the United States, but

04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:26.560
Russia in the last 10 years

04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:30.580
often resort to the measure

04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:32.500
of economic sanctions.

04:17:34.740 --> 04:17:35.740
If you classify economic

04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:38.160
sanctions, they can be divided

04:17:38.170 --> 04:17:39.680
into trade embargo, point sanctions

04:17:39.780 --> 04:17:42.320
and financial sanctions.

04:17:42.720 --> 04:17:44.200
In principle, the introduction of

04:17:44.210 --> 04:17:46.140
a trade embargo implies that

04:17:46.150 --> 04:17:47.800
export and import flows to this country

04:17:47.810 --> 04:17:49.660
are blocked, with the exception

04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:52.480
of humanitarian flows within the

04:17:52.490 --> 04:17:54.820
framework of humanitarian

04:17:55.200 --> 04:17:58.600
aid, medicines, food products.

04:17:58.680 --> 04:18:01.780
Such a trade embargo has negative

04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:03.300
socio-economic consequences,

04:18:03.310 --> 04:18:05.140
so far as it is not likely

04:18:05.540 --> 04:18:07.620
that the wealthy class

04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:09.620
or those political leaders against

04:18:09.630 --> 04:18:11.680
whose policies these

04:18:11.690 --> 04:18:13.760
sanctions were directed

04:18:13.770 --> 04:18:14.540
suffer.

04:18:15.800 --> 04:18:18.680
The third party mostly affected

04:18:18.690 --> 04:18:20.420
by the introduction of the trade

04:18:20.430 --> 04:18:23.700
embargo is the ordinary population

04:18:23.710 --> 04:18:25.340
of the country.

04:18:25.460 --> 04:18:26.960
And often the introduction of a

04:18:26.970 --> 04:18:30.060
trade embargo has a negative effect.

04:18:30.500 --> 04:18:32.940
In particular, suppose the

04:18:33.060 --> 04:18:36.760
introduction of a ban on exports

04:18:36.770 --> 04:18:40.720
– imports of diamonds from the regions

04:18:40.730 --> 04:18:45.120
of South Africa, which was

04:18:45.130 --> 04:18:48.460
organized and directed against those

04:18:48.470 --> 04:18:51.340
militant groups that at this time

04:18:51.350 --> 04:18:54.360
developed military relations there.

04:18:56.760 --> 04:18:59.100
The consequences of these sanctions

04:18:59.110 --> 04:19:00.780
had a negative effect in that,

04:19:00.860 --> 04:19:03.160
once the legal flow of diamond

04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:05.060
import exports were blocked,

04:19:05.070 --> 04:19:07.320
the illegal trade developed,

04:19:07.330 --> 04:19:09.540
and moreover, the prices

04:19:09.550 --> 04:19:12.260
of these diamonds rose.

04:19:12.320 --> 04:19:14.820
Thus, the profits from growth,

04:19:15.120 --> 04:19:17.080
the world price growth, received

04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:19.660
just those groups against which economic

04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:21.620
sanctions were directed in

04:19:21.630 --> 04:19:23.580
the form of a trade embargo.

04:19:23.940 --> 04:19:25.800
In modern conditions, point

04:19:25.810 --> 04:19:28.400
sanctions are preferred.

04:19:28.480 --> 04:19:28.740
Why is?

04:19:28.880 --> 04:19:30.060
Because, first, they are aimed

04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:31.840
at a separate group of goods, and

04:19:31.850 --> 04:19:35.640
a more developed form of point sanctions

04:19:35.650 --> 04:19:37.720
is the direction of these restrictions

04:19:37.730 --> 04:19:40.620
in general on the activities

04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:42.600
of individual lists, on their movement

04:19:42.610 --> 04:19:45.080
between countries, entry, exit.

04:19:46.860 --> 04:19:48.680
In this case, such precise sanctions

04:19:48.690 --> 04:19:50.620
are supported by financial sanctions,

04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:53.500
when the accounts of those representatives

04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:57.020
of groups and parties against

04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:59.400
whose policies and economic

04:19:59.410 --> 04:20:01.240
sanctions were directed

04:20:01.250 --> 04:20:03.180
are arrested.

04:20:06.360 --> 04:20:08.020
Now a few words about the Russian

04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.960
policy.

04:20:10.300 --> 04:20:12.380
In principle, the processes

04:20:12.390 --> 04:20:14.240
of liberalization, as I said, protectionism,

04:20:14.540 --> 04:20:16.580
are inherent in the tariff

04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:18.140
policy of Russia over

04:20:18.150 --> 04:20:21.700
the past 15-17 years.

04:20:22.000 --> 04:20:23.960
Depending on the economic

04:20:23.970 --> 04:20:25.460
situation in Russia,

04:20:25.470 --> 04:20:27.260
Russia’s policy will change

04:20:27.270 --> 04:20:30.140
either in favor of

04:20:30.150 --> 04:20:33.300
greater liberalization or

04:20:33.310 --> 04:20:35.400
in favor of a more rigid

04:20:35.410 --> 04:20:36.980
protectionism.

04:20:37.600 --> 04:20:39.520
In particular, the milestones can be said

04:20:39.660 --> 04:20:43.820
that in 1993 such the first milestone

04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:45.640
of the tariff policy of the Russian

04:20:45.650 --> 04:20:46.880
Federation was the introduction

04:20:46.890 --> 04:20:49.660
of the Customs Code, which in

04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:53.100
2002 underwent a correction.

04:20:53.220 --> 04:20:54.540
And this last adjustment was

04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:56.260
related to the liberalization

04:20:56.270 --> 04:20:59.120
of relations, with the liberalization

04:20:59.130 --> 04:21:02.240
of various types of restrictions.

04:21:02.540 --> 04:21:05.380
Russia, since 1995,

04:21:05.500 --> 04:21:08.140
has been preparing

04:21:08.150 --> 04:21:09.680
for WTO membership.

04:21:09.690 --> 04:21:10.780


04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:12.920
Multilateral bilateral negotiations

04:21:12.960 --> 04:21:14.760
were held with almost

04:21:14.770 --> 04:21:16.900
all WTO member countries

04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:19.560
and bilateral agreements

04:21:19.570 --> 04:21:22.120
were signed.

04:21:23.640 --> 04:21:27.220
In general, the protectionist

04:21:27.230 --> 04:21:28.920
measures system can be said that

04:21:28.930 --> 04:21:31.100
the satisfactory tariff rates at

04:21:31.110 --> 04:21:33.240
the level of 5 percent of the

04:21:33.250 --> 04:21:36.340
estate cover about 40 percent

04:21:38.210 --> 04:21:39.640
of the nomenclature of Russian

04:21:39.650 --> 04:21:43.040
imports and more than 44 percent

04:21:43.050 --> 04:21:46.280
of the volume of imports from

04:21:46.290 --> 04:21:48.160
countries of far abroad.

04:21:48.640 --> 04:21:51.120
In general, when one country

04:21:51.130 --> 04:21:53.940
finally enters the World Trade Organization

04:21:53.950 --> 04:21:55.820
system, the average tariff

04:21:56.120 --> 04:21:57.960
is calculated.

04:21:58.000 --> 04:21:59.880
Therefore, for some commodity

04:21:59.890 --> 04:22:01.740
groups, the tariff may be zero on

04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:03.580
imports, this is usually the

04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:05.700
middle groups, and for some is

04:22:05.710 --> 04:22:08.420
quite high, for example, 15 percent.

04:22:08.430 --> 04:22:10.700
On average, this means that the

04:22:10.710 --> 04:22:12.360
average level of protectionism

04:22:12.370 --> 04:22:14.020
will be at 7 percent.

04:22:14.620 --> 04:22:18.600
Accordingly, countries take into account

04:22:18.610 --> 04:22:25.240
the entire package of agreements and

04:22:25.250 --> 04:22:29.560
all types of goods and the entire tariff

04:22:29.570 --> 04:22:32.540
grid, and such an intermediate level

04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:34.980
of protectionism is calculated.

04:22:35.380 --> 04:22:37.140
The trend of the current tariff

04:22:37.150 --> 04:22:40.420
policy of Russia is related to

04:22:41.820 --> 04:22:44.760
the fact that, first, documents and

04:22:44.770 --> 04:22:47.320
legislative acts were developed for

04:22:47.330 --> 04:22:49.900
a long time, which would not contradict

04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:51.900
the norms of the World Trade

04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:53.200
Organization.

04:22:54.180 --> 04:22:58.700
In particular, such

04:22:59.600 --> 04:23:01.000
favourable measures, which mean

04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:03.960
that tariff and other restrictions

04:23:03.970 --> 04:23:05.780
between the two countries that have

04:23:05.840 --> 04:23:07.460
signed such a regime of greatest

04:23:07.470 --> 04:23:09.180
favourable measures, are not

04:23:09.560 --> 04:23:13.900
worse than in relation to third

04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:14.880
countries.

04:23:15.020 --> 04:23:18.400
And thus, within the framework of these

04:23:26.330 --> 04:23:28.680
agreements, Russia, signing what are

04:23:29.560 --> 04:23:31.820
the factors of weakening the functions

04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:33.480
of Russian tariffs?

04:23:33.760 --> 04:23:35.640
This is because the Russian

04:23:36.140 --> 04:23:37.760
market economy is still

04:23:37.770 --> 04:23:39.840
very young.

04:23:40.940 --> 04:23:43.560
In Russian reality, the gray

04:23:43.570 --> 04:23:46.200
schemes of foreign goods

04:23:46.210 --> 04:23:48.340
are rapidly developing and

04:23:48.350 --> 04:23:51.270
still spreading, which concerns,

04:23:51.280 --> 04:23:54.640
first of all, goods of industrial

04:23:54.650 --> 04:23:59.100
purpose, long-term use,

04:23:59.110 --> 04:24:01.440
mainly technological

04:24:01.450 --> 04:24:03.060
goods that are imported

04:24:03.320 --> 04:24:07.440
from the Asian

04:24:07.450 --> 04:24:09.220
region.

04:24:09.860 --> 04:24:11.880
The next factor is to reshape.

04:24:12.440 --> 04:24:14.400
In this case, again, when determining

04:24:14.410 --> 04:24:16.960
the value of the goods carried,

04:24:16.970 --> 04:24:20.460
manipulation with this value is possible

04:24:20.470 --> 04:24:22.740
and, accordingly, the goal of many

04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:25.300
firms is to lower the value

04:24:25.310 --> 04:24:26.260
of the goods.

04:24:26.800 --> 04:24:28.380
And the main problem, of course, is

04:24:28.390 --> 04:24:30.360
already related to the development

04:24:30.370 --> 04:24:33.980
of a system of measures that would allow

04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:36.760
to level some subjective moments, that

04:24:36.770 --> 04:24:38.120
is, when the goods pass through

04:24:38.130 --> 04:24:40.320
the customs, the personal interests

04:24:40.330 --> 04:24:42.480
of customs officers will outweigh

04:24:42.560 --> 04:24:45.180
the interests of the state.

04:24:48.000 --> 04:24:50.400
On the other hand, in Russia, as in

04:24:50.410 --> 04:24:52.980
the world, there are schemes for

04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:55.260
optimizing tax and customs payments,

04:24:55.270 --> 04:24:58.140
which again reduces the real level

04:24:58.150 --> 04:25:01.080
of protection of tariffs.

04:25:02.200 --> 04:25:04.360
The last component is the

04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:05.300
boat import.

04:25:05.520 --> 04:25:07.480
The trend of boat imports goes to the

04:25:07.490 --> 04:25:14.400
economy of the early 90s.

04:25:14.880 --> 04:25:17.380
Most of the supply of long-

04:25:17.390 --> 04:25:21.160
term goods, clothing from the

04:25:21.170 --> 04:25:23.640
near and far abroad went by

04:25:23.650 --> 04:25:26.000
boat method to the Russian

04:25:26.010 --> 04:25:27.760
retail markets.

04:25:28.120 --> 04:25:30.240
In modern conditions, the import

04:25:30.250 --> 04:25:34.140
of boats is slowly transformed into

04:25:34.150 --> 04:25:36.420
a more established type of activity

04:25:36.430 --> 04:25:40.160
of small and medium-sized companies,

04:25:40.170 --> 04:25:42.020
which are more subject

04:25:42.030 --> 04:25:43.500
to state regulation.

04:25:44.040 --> 04:25:45.860
In this regard, it can be assumed that

04:25:45.870 --> 04:25:48.040
the import of boat as a factor weakening

04:25:48.180 --> 04:25:50.100
the functions of the Russian tariff

04:25:50.110 --> 04:25:52.920
system, will slowly as the development

04:25:52.930 --> 04:25:55.120
of market relations in Russia will

04:25:55.130 --> 04:25:58.180
be reduced to nothing.

04:26:03.860 --> 04:26:05.340
The next topic we will consider

04:26:05.350 --> 04:26:07.480
in our course is the international

04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:09.060
monetary and financial system

04:26:09.070 --> 04:26:12.140
and currency regulation.

04:26:12.560 --> 04:26:14.000
The international monetary and financial

04:26:14.010 --> 04:26:16.180
system is a form of organization

04:26:16.190 --> 04:26:17.460
of monetary and financial relations

04:26:17.470 --> 04:26:19.200
established in international

04:26:19.210 --> 04:26:21.240
agreements, which function

04:26:21.420 --> 04:26:23.280
independently and serves the

04:26:23.290 --> 04:26:24.680
international movement of

04:26:24.690 --> 04:26:27.100
goods and factors of production.

04:26:29.060 --> 04:26:31.140
The development of the currency and financial system

04:26:31.150 --> 04:26:33.600
of the country is influenced by a number of factors.

04:26:34.380 --> 04:26:37.560
First, the development of the country’s economy.

04:26:37.900 --> 04:26:40.980
Of course, if the country has a

04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:43.180
stable economic growth, if the country

04:26:44.160 --> 04:26:46.740
has low inflation, low unemployment,

04:26:47.880 --> 04:26:51.040
then the attitude to the currency

04:26:51.050 --> 04:26:53.620
of the country is positive, and

04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:55.900
usually it is strong, stable

04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:58.000
and preferred by all if we export

04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:09.020
goods and are the leader in

04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:14.740
the export of goods of various

04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:17.820
industries, then again - yet

04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:20.500
international demand for our

04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:23.660
currency to pay for export transactions

04:27:23.670 --> 04:27:26.220
will be present in the

04:27:26.230 --> 04:27:28.160
world community, which

04:27:28.170 --> 04:27:29.860
again - again - supports

04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:32.800
our currency.

04:27:33.060 --> 04:27:34.060
The national and world

04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:35.300
political situation is

04:27:35.360 --> 04:27:36.620
also a factor of influence

04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:38.020
on the country’s currency

04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:40.240
relationship.

04:27:40.820 --> 04:27:43.020
The extreme variant of unstable political

04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:44.740
situation is war and, accordingly,

04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:47.980
during the period of wars, the currencies

04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:51.040
of the warring countries, the

04:27:51.100 --> 04:27:52.780
currency parties usually

04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:55.940
weaken, there is a fairly high level

04:27:55.950 --> 04:27:58.080
of inflation, there is

04:27:58.840 --> 04:28:01.800
devaluation of the money mass.

04:28:01.960 --> 04:28:04.080
The economic sanctions of the embargo,

04:28:04.090 --> 04:28:06.580
which were discussed in the

04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:07.560
topic of state regulation of

04:28:07.570 --> 04:28:09.560
foreign trade relations,

04:28:10.060 --> 04:28:13.700
will also negatively affect

04:28:13.710 --> 04:28:16.080
the state of our currency.

04:28:16.400 --> 04:28:17.740
And if some countries have imposed

04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:19.320
economic restrictions against our

04:28:19.330 --> 04:28:20.980
country for political purposes,

04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:22.340
sanctions and embargoes everywhere,

04:28:22.350 --> 04:28:24.240
it means that trade is beginning

04:28:24.380 --> 04:28:26.580
to be restrained.

04:28:26.620 --> 04:28:28.180
Accordingly, the receipts of foreign

04:28:28.190 --> 04:28:29.780
currencies in our country are decreasing,

04:28:29.940 --> 04:28:33.780
exports and imports are decreasing.

04:28:34.340 --> 04:28:35.340
Accordingly, the country

04:28:35.350 --> 04:28:37.800
is developing a situation where

04:28:37.810 --> 04:28:40.080
a trade balance of payments

04:28:40.090 --> 04:28:41.580
deficit is possible,

04:28:41.590 --> 04:28:44.100
which will affect the level

04:28:44.110 --> 04:28:45.940
of our exchange rate.

04:28:46.300 --> 04:28:48.320
The balance of power between countries

04:28:48.330 --> 04:28:50.180
is another factor that affects the currency

04:28:50.190 --> 04:28:53.100
relations of a country.

04:28:53.720 --> 04:28:55.880
Of course, any economy, developed

04:28:56.140 --> 04:28:57.920
or developing, undergoes

04:28:58.180 --> 04:29:00.040
cyclical fluctuations.

04:29:00.180 --> 04:29:01.940
And there are periods of recession

04:29:01.950 --> 04:29:04.260
of national economies,

04:29:04.270 --> 04:29:06.060
when the pace of economic growth is

04:29:06.070 --> 04:29:08.500
reduced or overall economic growth

04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:10.560
goes to negative indicators.

04:29:11.140 --> 04:29:13.640
Of course, countries with strong,

04:29:13.860 --> 04:29:15.880
developed, market economies are more

04:29:15.890 --> 04:29:18.140
likely to suffer from this situation.

04:29:19.200 --> 04:29:21.040
And even though their currencies

04:29:21.050 --> 04:29:22.620
are becoming weaker over a

04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:24.520
period of time, less protected

04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:26.480
by the pressure of domestic

04:29:26.490 --> 04:29:28.180
economic relations, yet

04:29:28.190 --> 04:29:31.040
developed market economies have

04:29:31.050 --> 04:29:33.340
more opportunities than developing

04:29:33.350 --> 04:29:35.240
economies than transition

04:29:35.250 --> 04:29:37.100
economies to maintain their

04:29:37.340 --> 04:29:40.040
national currency.

04:29:42.780 --> 04:29:45.940
Objectives of the currency and financial system.

04:29:46.000 --> 04:29:48.280
First of all, it is the provision

04:29:48.290 --> 04:29:50.720
of the exchange goods, the same flow of

04:29:50.730 --> 04:29:52.420
exports and imports.

04:29:53.200 --> 04:29:54.680
The next goal is to ensure the stability

04:29:54.690 --> 04:29:57.220
of the currency mechanism.

04:29:57.920 --> 04:29:59.180
Estability of financial

04:29:59.190 --> 04:30:00.860
flows.

04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:03.560
As we remember, financial flows can have

04:30:03.570 --> 04:30:05.840
an independent significance, especially

04:30:05.850 --> 04:30:08.700
at the current stage of the development

04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:12.060
of the world economy.

04:30:12.300 --> 04:30:14.200
And in this case I mean financial

04:30:14.210 --> 04:30:17.320
flows in the form of direct and portfolio

04:30:17.330 --> 04:30:19.380
investments, financial flows in

04:30:19.390 --> 04:30:24.140
the form of loans and loans.

04:30:24.220 --> 04:30:25.860
Another goal of the currency and financial

04:30:25.870 --> 04:30:27.760
system is to ensure flexibility in relation

04:30:27.770 --> 04:30:29.920
to the changing economic

04:30:29.930 --> 04:30:32.120
situation of the country.

04:30:32.320 --> 04:30:34.860
Ideally, the currency system

04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:36.540
should roll out as a mechanism

04:30:36.550 --> 04:30:39.880
where the government, its central

04:30:40.420 --> 04:30:42.880
bank, will have sufficient

04:30:42.890 --> 04:30:44.680
leverage to support the currency

04:30:44.690 --> 04:30:48.860
rate that is more effective

04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:52.400
for a given stage of the

04:30:52.410 --> 04:30:54.400
country’s economic development.

04:30:54.410 --> 04:30:55.720


04:31:00.720 --> 04:31:02.420
What are the currency and

04:31:02.430 --> 04:31:03.640
financial systems?

04:31:03.700 --> 04:31:04.940
First, these are the currency elements

04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:06.280
of the system.

04:31:06.400 --> 04:31:08.020
These include the national currency,

04:31:08.030 --> 04:31:12.560
the conditions of their mutual

04:31:12.570 --> 04:31:18.160
convertibility of currencies and the

04:31:18.170 --> 04:31:19.600
conditions of conduct, maintenance

04:31:19.610 --> 04:31:21.340
of this convertibility, currency

04:31:21.350 --> 04:31:23.660
parity, that is, in this case, the

04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:26.780
ratio between currencies and the

04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:28.160
basis on which this currency

04:31:28.170 --> 04:31:29.520
parity is calculated, the

04:31:29.530 --> 04:31:32.200
exchange rate and national

04:31:32.210 --> 04:31:34.040
and international mechanisms

04:31:34.050 --> 04:31:36.220
of its regulation.

04:31:37.140 --> 04:31:39.820
Usually, the currency deviates

04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:41.960
from the currency parity, therefore,

04:31:41.970 --> 04:31:43.900
the question of what is the

04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:46.540
basis of the currency rate of the

04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:49.300
country is an interesting problem,

04:31:49.310 --> 04:31:51.900
which we will talk about a little

04:31:51.910 --> 04:31:52.980
later.

04:31:53.920 --> 04:31:55.720
Financial elements of the system.

04:31:56.060 --> 04:31:57.380
These are international financial

04:31:57.390 --> 04:31:59.860
markets, and when we talk about the

04:31:59.870 --> 04:32:01.920
financial market, it is

04:32:01.930 --> 04:32:03.760
assumed that it is not only a currency

04:32:03.770 --> 04:32:06.140
market, but a stock market, that is,

04:32:06.150 --> 04:32:09.440
a securities market and a

04:32:09.450 --> 04:32:10.780
credit market.

04:32:10.940 --> 04:32:12.260
Accordingly, the financial elements

04:32:12.270 --> 04:32:15.040
of the system in the form of financial

04:32:15.050 --> 04:32:16.900
markets can be represented in the

04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:18.880
interbank market, respectively,

04:32:19.020 --> 04:32:20.780
where agents and counterparties

04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:22.180
of this system are

04:32:22.190 --> 04:32:23.580
banks.

04:32:25.520 --> 04:32:28.520
Second, it is a stock market, i.e. a

04:32:28.530 --> 04:32:33.200
system existing for the purchase

04:32:33.210 --> 04:32:36.800
and sale of currencies, stock exchanges,

04:32:36.810 --> 04:32:40.260
a system existing for the purchase

04:32:40.270 --> 04:32:42.220
and sale of securities.

04:32:42.600 --> 04:32:45.080
The same financial system includes

04:32:45.090 --> 04:32:46.660
the currency market and the non-

04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:48.780
exchange stock markets.

04:32:49.320 --> 04:32:51.240
The second component of the financial

04:32:51.250 --> 04:32:54.100
elements of the system is

04:32:54.110 --> 04:32:56.620
the mechanism of trading specific

04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:58.200
financial instruments,

04:32:58.210 --> 04:33:01.240
namely currency, securities, loans.

04:33:03.890 --> 04:33:05.710
Economic agents in the

04:33:05.720 --> 04:33:07.870
financial, namely, currency,

04:33:07.930 --> 04:33:09.910
stock, credit market

04:33:09.920 --> 04:33:12.550
are individuals, corporations,

04:33:12.560 --> 04:33:14.650
central banks.

04:33:15.310 --> 04:33:16.770


04:33:16.790 --> 04:33:19.530
We are quite accustomed to these

04:33:19.540 --> 04:33:22.230
economic agents, but the activity

04:33:22.240 --> 04:33:24.750
has been developed in the last 20

04:33:24.760 --> 04:33:27.390
years by new economic agents, such

04:33:27.630 --> 04:33:29.410
as municipalities, public

04:33:29.570 --> 04:33:31.110
organizations.

04:33:36.400 --> 04:33:38.720
Consider the scheme of the organization

04:33:38.730 --> 04:33:40.680
of the international financial market.

04:33:41.120 --> 04:33:44.000
First of all, exchange between

04:33:44.010 --> 04:33:46.900
counterparties of the international

04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:50.180
financial market is banking, bank

04:33:50.440 --> 04:33:52.900
credit organizations, insurance

04:33:53.100 --> 04:33:55.040
firms and pension funds.

04:34:02.600 --> 04:34:05.160
As I have already said, this is due

04:34:05.170 --> 04:34:06.100
to the credit and active

04:34:06.110 --> 04:34:08.520
in the international financial

04:34:08.530 --> 04:34:11.180
market for the last 20 years.

04:34:11.520 --> 04:34:13.940
In principle, relations between

04:34:13.950 --> 04:34:16.680
creditors and sellers in

04:34:16.690 --> 04:34:19.640
the financial credit market

04:34:19.650 --> 04:34:23.620
can be banks, bank credit

04:34:23.630 --> 04:34:25.320
institutions, insurance firms,

04:34:25.330 --> 04:34:26.760
pension funds.

04:34:27.180 --> 04:34:29.580
But, in principle, on the other hand,

04:34:29.940 --> 04:34:31.400
these relationships can be built and

04:34:31.580 --> 04:34:34.240
the lender and borrowers can do without

04:34:34.250 --> 04:34:35.800
an intermediary.

04:34:36.400 --> 04:34:39.400
It is assumed that the same scheme is

04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:42.240
also suitable for characterization

04:34:42.250 --> 04:34:43.460
not only of the financial

04:34:43.470 --> 04:34:45.700
but also of the currency market.

04:34:45.820 --> 04:34:47.540
Then we will have sellers and

04:34:47.550 --> 04:34:48.900
buyers of currency.

04:34:49.260 --> 04:34:51.360
In the securities market, the sellers

04:34:51.370 --> 04:34:52.860
and buyers of securities are

04:34:53.720 --> 04:34:55.480
the corresponding financial intermediaries

04:34:55.490 --> 04:34:59.240
in the financial market.

04:34:59.360 --> 04:35:02.160
Now let us turn to the main component

04:35:02.560 --> 04:35:05.740
of the currency system of any

04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:06.520
country.

04:35:06.660 --> 04:35:08.060
It is currency.

04:35:08.260 --> 04:35:11.160
In the broad sense of the word currency

04:35:11.170 --> 04:35:13.920
is any commodity that is able to perform

04:35:13.930 --> 04:35:15.440
the function of money.

04:35:16.100 --> 04:35:18.400
As you know, economic theory puts forward

04:35:18.410 --> 04:35:20.260
a number of functions of money.

04:35:20.500 --> 04:35:22.320
It is a measure of value, means

04:35:22.330 --> 04:35:24.180
of circulation, means of payment,

04:35:24.440 --> 04:35:26.180
means of storage, world money.

04:35:26.860 --> 04:35:28.760
In modern conditions, virtually

04:35:28.770 --> 04:35:31.400
no currency performs the function

04:35:31.410 --> 04:35:33.140
of world money, that is, such

04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:34.920
money that would be recognized

04:35:34.930 --> 04:35:37.260
for exchange, for payments

04:35:37.270 --> 04:35:39.000
by all states.

04:35:39.500 --> 04:35:42.340
But, nevertheless, we can

04:35:42.350 --> 04:35:50.520
say that in modern currencies are performed.

04:35:51.240 --> 04:35:53.540
And the currency in the international

04:35:53.550 --> 04:35:56.260
exchange, in the international arena,

04:35:56.270 --> 04:35:57.980
should provide international

04:35:57.990 --> 04:36:00.980
commodity flows, as well as work in

04:36:00.990 --> 04:36:04.120
the international credit and

04:36:04.130 --> 04:36:06.040
stock market.

04:36:07.560 --> 04:36:09.960
The currency can be classified by belonging.

04:36:10.200 --> 04:36:11.800
In principle, if you ask the

04:36:11.810 --> 04:36:13.920
people what a currency is, they

04:36:13.930 --> 04:36:15.440
will say dollars or euros.

04:36:15.720 --> 04:36:17.680
In this case, the term refers

04:36:17.690 --> 04:36:19.940
to foreign currency.

04:36:20.220 --> 04:36:21.560
Therefore, it is a payment instrument

04:36:21.570 --> 04:36:23.800
of other countries that is legally

04:36:23.810 --> 04:36:25.760
or illegally used in the

04:36:25.770 --> 04:36:27.760
territory of the country.

04:36:28.080 --> 04:36:30.820
At the same time, the national

04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:32.780
currency, that is, the most legal

04:36:32.790 --> 04:36:34.960
means of payment in the territory

04:36:34.970 --> 04:36:38.260
of the country that issues it,

04:36:38.270 --> 04:36:42.400
which provides the exchange of goods.

04:36:46.020 --> 04:36:49.320
The possibility of

04:36:49.330 --> 04:36:51.900
currency regulation.

04:36:57.360 --> 04:36:59.600
In principle, the following characteristics

04:36:59.610 --> 04:37:01.940
of currency can be distinguished

04:37:01.950 --> 04:37:03.760
reserve, freely convertible, solid

04:37:03.860 --> 04:37:05.100
currency.

04:37:05.120 --> 04:37:07.160
All these characteristics relate to the different

04:37:07.170 --> 04:37:08.780
national currencies of the countries

04:37:08.790 --> 04:37:09.460
of the world.

04:37:10.840 --> 04:37:13.040
Of course, a single national currency

04:37:13.050 --> 04:37:14.840
may not have these characteristics,

04:37:14.850 --> 04:37:16.560
but any national currency

04:37:16.570 --> 04:37:18.040
and, accordingly, those

04:37:18.050 --> 04:37:19.660
currency bodies that try to regulate

04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:21.180
currency relations, try to

04:37:21.190 --> 04:37:23.440
develop their system to

04:37:23.450 --> 04:37:25.060
such a level that the national

04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:26.940
currency becomes both reserve

04:37:26.950 --> 04:37:28.900
and freely reversible

04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:30.520
and solid.

04:37:31.000 --> 04:37:33.440
Let’s look, Borja, carefully at the definition.

04:37:33.560 --> 04:37:36.700
Reserve currency is the currency

04:37:36.710 --> 04:37:42.760
of foreign states that national

04:37:42.770 --> 04:37:47.000
economies accumulate to

04:37:47.010 --> 04:37:51.000
maintain their currency

04:37:51.010 --> 04:37:52.240
reserves.

04:37:52.660 --> 04:37:55.340
Accordingly, if a situation of payment

04:37:55.350 --> 04:37:58.560
deficit is created in the country,

04:37:58.570 --> 04:38:01.320
in particular on the foreign

04:38:01.330 --> 04:38:02.800
trade balance of payments,

04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:05.500
then in this case, the central

04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:07.700
bank can cover the negative

04:38:07.710 --> 04:38:10.220
balance of the balance of payments

04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:12.880
from the currency reserves.

04:38:12.940 --> 04:38:15.200
Of course, the reserve currency

04:38:15.210 --> 04:38:18.280
is a currency that should have

04:38:18.290 --> 04:38:21.060
the following properties in our

04:38:21.070 --> 04:38:22.620
list, namely, it must be freely

04:38:22.630 --> 04:38:24.920
reversible and solid.

04:38:24.930 --> 04:38:26.220
What is a free

04:38:26.230 --> 04:38:27.680
currency?

04:38:27.840 --> 04:38:29.580
This is a currency that is

04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:30.760
widely used for international

04:38:30.770 --> 04:38:32.000
payment transactions,

04:38:32.010 --> 04:38:33.940
is actively sold and bought,

04:38:33.950 --> 04:38:35.660
and is generally recognized by

04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:37.800
all players in the international

04:38:37.810 --> 04:38:39.740
currency market.

04:38:40.040 --> 04:38:42.740
This definition is of course

04:38:42.900 --> 04:38:44.280
the most common for the concept

04:38:44.290 --> 04:38:46.700
of free reversible currency, we

04:38:46.710 --> 04:38:48.720
will further look at the criteria

04:38:48.730 --> 04:38:50.060
of reversibility.

04:38:50.480 --> 04:38:52.200
A hard currency.

04:38:52.220 --> 04:38:55.160
In this case, just the hard currency

04:38:55.170 --> 04:38:57.180
is the basis of the reserve currency,

04:38:57.190 --> 04:38:58.800
and in general, just the hard

04:38:58.810 --> 04:39:03.800
currency is characterized by

04:39:03.810 --> 04:39:05.920
a stable exchange rate, it is

04:39:05.930 --> 04:39:07.940
less prone to financial risks.

04:39:09.380 --> 04:39:11.000
In this case, it is assumed that

04:39:11.100 --> 04:39:13.040
the solid currency is organized

04:39:13.050 --> 04:39:14.500
precisely when it is formed

04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:16.480
or only in those countries where

04:39:16.700 --> 04:39:18.440
internal economic stability

04:39:18.450 --> 04:39:20.040
is the main feature of

04:39:20.050 --> 04:39:21.640
economic development.

04:39:22.060 --> 04:39:24.160
A solid currency is formed

04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:34.400
when the internal trend of

04:39:34.410 --> 04:39:36.400
the economy has positive

04:39:36.410 --> 04:39:38.680
results on all macroeconomic

04:39:38.690 --> 04:39:42.020
indicators.

04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:45.990
Now let’s look at the currency

04:39:46.000 --> 04:39:47.690
conversion.

04:39:47.810 --> 04:39:49.090
What is Conversion?

04:39:49.130 --> 04:39:50.530
The ability of residents and

04:39:50.540 --> 04:39:52.470
non-residents to freely exchange their

04:39:52.480 --> 04:39:55.110
national currency for foreign currency

04:39:55.120 --> 04:39:57.330
and use foreign currency in trade

04:39:57.340 --> 04:39:59.270
and financial transactions.

04:39:59.570 --> 04:40:05.010
As you can see, it is assumed that we have

04:40:05.020 --> 04:40:07.170
its ability to exchange for

04:40:07.180 --> 04:40:09.890
foreign currency understood in the

04:40:09.900 --> 04:40:11.470
concept of convertibility.

04:40:12.750 --> 04:40:14.890
In this case, we have

04:40:14.900 --> 04:40:16.490
the definition of resident

04:40:16.500 --> 04:40:17.830
and non-resident.

04:40:18.810 --> 04:40:21.050
In general, the most accurate

04:40:21.060 --> 04:40:22.450
definition of residents is given

04:40:22.460 --> 04:40:24.030
by economic statistics.

04:40:24.210 --> 04:40:26.470
If they are natural persons, they are

04:40:26.480 --> 04:40:29.350
citizens of a country who are in its territory

04:40:29.360 --> 04:40:31.370
for more than six months.

04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:35.930
Residents and legal entities are

04:40:35.940 --> 04:40:38.350
legal entities from the moment

04:40:38.360 --> 04:40:40.470
of registration of legal entity.

04:40:40.530 --> 04:40:41.970
Once a company

04:40:41.980 --> 04:40:43.310
is registered in

04:40:43.320 --> 04:40:44.170
the country,

04:40:44.180 --> 04:40:46.630
it is a resident.

04:40:46.710 --> 04:40:48.250
In this case, it is assumed

04:40:48.260 --> 04:40:50.070
that both residents and non-residents

04:40:50.130 --> 04:40:52.150
freely exchange the national

04:40:52.160 --> 04:40:54.430
currency and use it for their

04:40:54.440 --> 04:40:57.170
trade and currency transactions.

04:40:57.180 --> 04:40:58.290


04:40:58.670 --> 04:41:02.230
In order to understand the principles

04:41:02.240 --> 04:41:04.430
of currency convertibility, on such

04:41:04.440 --> 04:41:08.270
two essential characteristics as currency

04:41:08.610 --> 04:41:11.350
convertibility on current accounts

04:41:11.360 --> 04:41:13.950
and currency convertibility on capital

04:41:13.960 --> 04:41:17.190
accounts, we need to apply

04:41:17.200 --> 04:41:19.270
to the balance of payments

04:41:19.280 --> 04:41:21.270
scheme.

04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:23.150
Let us look carefully.

04:41:23.970 --> 04:41:26.150
The balance of payments consists of two

04:41:26.160 --> 04:41:27.350
large accounts.

04:41:27.360 --> 04:41:29.610
Account of current operations.

04:41:29.710 --> 04:41:31.690
The first item in the current

04:41:31.700 --> 04:41:36.310
account counts exports and imports.

04:41:36.710 --> 04:41:38.730
The difference between exports and

04:41:38.740 --> 04:41:40.970
imports is defined as the country’s

04:41:40.980 --> 04:41:42.470
trade balance.

04:41:42.480 --> 04:41:44.590
If exports are greater than

04:41:44.600 --> 04:41:46.250
imports, the trade balance

04:41:46.260 --> 04:41:47.930
is positive.

04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:51.770
The second article of the balance

04:41:51.780 --> 04:41:53.710
of payments is income received

04:41:53.720 --> 04:41:56.630
abroad and income paid abroad.

04:41:56.870 --> 04:41:58.410
Income of owners of

04:41:58.420 --> 04:41:59.430
factors of production,

04:41:59.440 --> 04:42:01.370
i.e. payroll, interest, profits

04:42:01.380 --> 04:42:03.210
related to foreign economic

04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:05.070
activity, are included

04:42:05.080 --> 04:42:06.690
in the account of current

04:42:06.730 --> 04:42:09.690
operations.

04:42:10.110 --> 04:42:11.670
And the last component of the

04:42:11.680 --> 04:42:14.210
current transaction account

04:42:14.220 --> 04:42:16.070
is current private transfers

04:42:16.080 --> 04:42:17.550
that are received from abroad

04:42:17.560 --> 04:42:19.370
or paid abroad.

04:42:19.380 --> 04:42:22.590
In this case, such current private

04:42:22.600 --> 04:42:25.490
transfers are expected.

04:42:25.500 --> 04:42:28.470
These are various donations, this

04:42:28.650 --> 04:42:30.710
is help that is provided

04:42:30.720 --> 04:42:33.210
by private organizations, not the state.

04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:36.910
So, if we now sum up the indicators

04:42:36.920 --> 04:42:39.150
of the left and right column presented

04:42:39.250 --> 04:42:42.350
on our scheme and find the difference

04:42:42.360 --> 04:42:45.410
between them, the balance of

04:42:45.420 --> 04:42:47.970
the current account allows us

04:42:47.980 --> 04:42:50.690
to take into account mainly foreign

04:42:50.700 --> 04:42:53.450
trade flows and income flows

04:42:53.460 --> 04:42:55.350
of owners, the factors of production

04:42:55.360 --> 04:42:59.590
that are organized in international

04:42:59.600 --> 04:43:02.250
economic relations.

04:43:02.350 --> 04:43:04.770
The capital account or the capital transaction

04:43:04.780 --> 04:43:07.310
account, first of all, the first

04:43:07.320 --> 04:43:10.070
component of the capital account,

04:43:10.080 --> 04:43:12.710
is foreign investment and

04:43:12.720 --> 04:43:14.510
domestic investment, which we

04:43:14.520 --> 04:43:15.730
transfer abroad.

04:43:16.370 --> 04:43:19.190
Both investments can be

04:43:19.200 --> 04:43:21.630
portfolio and direct, but

04:43:21.640 --> 04:43:23.370
it does not matter.

04:43:23.410 --> 04:43:25.030
They can, of course, be divided into

04:43:25.040 --> 04:43:27.570
the account, but we have all these

04:43:27.580 --> 04:43:29.810
investment flows of financial presence

04:43:29.820 --> 04:43:31.770
in the first line in the capital

04:43:31.780 --> 04:43:32.670
account.

04:43:33.290 --> 04:43:34.650
The second line is the

04:43:34.660 --> 04:43:37.090
influx of state foreign transfers.

04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:39.550
Here, the state aid, the flows

04:43:39.560 --> 04:43:42.390
of financial aid, provided by

04:43:42.400 --> 04:43:43.430
the state structures,

04:43:43.440 --> 04:43:45.170
are reflected in the capital

04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:49.430
account, as an indicator

04:43:49.440 --> 04:43:50.710
of state foreign transfers,

04:43:50.720 --> 04:43:53.150
influx and outflow

04:43:53.160 --> 04:43:53.970
abroad.

04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:57.330
Accordingly, in addition to donations

04:43:57.340 --> 04:43:58.950
or such free financial assistance,

04:43:58.960 --> 04:44:01.730
such as transfers, another component

04:44:01.740 --> 04:44:04.190
of financial flows between

04:44:04.200 --> 04:44:06.390
countries are loans.

04:44:06.690 --> 04:44:08.410
And then the next line of the capital account

04:44:08.420 --> 04:44:11.290
is the influx of loans to the country and the

04:44:11.300 --> 04:44:13.830
outflow of loans from the country.

04:44:14.070 --> 04:44:16.330
The balance of the capital account balances

04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:19.750
the right column of the account and it is

04:44:19.760 --> 04:44:23.770
assumed that there is a certain interdependence

04:44:23.780 --> 04:44:25.370
between the balance of the trade

04:44:25.380 --> 04:44:27.530
balance and the balance of the

04:44:27.540 --> 04:44:28.990
capital account.

04:44:29.930 --> 04:44:31.990
The total balance of payments

04:44:32.000 --> 04:44:34.850
is calculated as the amount of the

04:44:34.860 --> 04:44:37.130
balance of trade and as the balance

04:44:37.140 --> 04:44:40.630
of the capital account.

04:44:46.520 --> 04:44:48.660
Note that in this case, both

04:44:48.670 --> 04:44:51.540
the trade balance, the current

04:44:51.550 --> 04:44:53.660
account and the capital

04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:56.300
account are quite interrelated.

04:44:56.620 --> 04:44:58.820
If the country develops

04:44:58.830 --> 04:45:00.680
international trade, exports are

04:45:00.690 --> 04:45:04.140
quite thunderstorming, then there

04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:07.300
is usually a positive trade balance

04:45:07.310 --> 04:45:09.580
and a positive balance of

04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:11.240
current operations.

04:45:11.250 --> 04:45:15.520
Then the state in the country,

04:45:15.530 --> 04:45:16.580
the economic agents

04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:18.740
accumulate excess capital

04:45:18.750 --> 04:45:19.940
assets.

04:45:20.060 --> 04:45:23.220
And then such a country usually gives

04:45:23.230 --> 04:45:26.260
to the court, carries out foreign

04:45:26.270 --> 04:45:29.020
transfers abroad, carries out international

04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:30.220
investments.

04:45:30.320 --> 04:45:32.020
The capital account is the balancing

04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:33.900
item of the current transaction

04:45:33.910 --> 04:45:36.580
account.

04:45:36.640 --> 04:45:39.080
And if we can have a positive balance on

04:45:39.090 --> 04:45:41.600
the current account, this means that there

04:45:41.610 --> 04:45:43.580
is an influx into the country for payments,

04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:45.420
for trade operations, then

04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:47.620
usually on the account of capital

04:45:47.630 --> 04:45:51.300
there is a outflow of investment abroad.

04:45:51.380 --> 04:45:53.160
The capital account will therefore

04:45:53.170 --> 04:45:54.980
have a negative value.

04:45:55.120 --> 04:45:57.100
Plus and minus in the general, so to speak,

04:45:57.240 --> 04:45:58.920
arithmetic composition in this

04:45:58.930 --> 04:46:00.640
case gives zero.

04:46:00.940 --> 04:46:02.500
That is, if the balance of payments

04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:05.760
is balanced, then it is in our case

04:46:05.770 --> 04:46:07.860
if the situation is that foreign trade

04:46:08.900 --> 04:46:10.580
is less developed, imports are

04:46:10.590 --> 04:46:12.960
large enough, and exporters are not

04:46:13.580 --> 04:46:15.220
so competitive in the international

04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:17.480
market, then the account of

04:46:17.490 --> 04:46:19.740
current transactions becomes negative.

04:46:19.880 --> 04:46:23.240
And to cover these external economic

04:46:23.250 --> 04:46:26.300
payments, the state and firms

04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:28.020
have to make loans.

04:46:28.900 --> 04:46:31.440
And then the account of capital, again,

04:46:31.450 --> 04:46:33.520
balances the negative account of current

04:46:33.530 --> 04:46:36.260
operations, and the indicator of

04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:37.900
the account of capital in our country

04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:39.640
becomes positive, there is a capital

04:46:39.650 --> 04:46:41.420
inflow of capital assets into

04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:42.540
the country.

04:46:42.600 --> 04:46:45.020
Thus, I will repeat again, the first

04:46:45.620 --> 04:46:46.800
and second half of the

04:46:46.810 --> 04:46:48.840
balance of payments are mutually

04:46:48.850 --> 04:46:50.620
balanced articles.

04:46:50.840 --> 04:46:53.680
If the situation has arisen that it

04:46:53.690 --> 04:46:55.900
is impossible for a country to

04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:59.960
fully cover the shortfall of the current

04:46:59.970 --> 04:47:02.900
account at the expense of loans

04:47:02.910 --> 04:47:04.340
from some other investment flow,

04:47:05.000 --> 04:47:05.640
how then?

04:47:05.660 --> 04:47:07.600
Then the reserve pounds are used.

04:47:07.960 --> 04:47:09.340
And then the currency reserve

04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:11.720
fund, which is connected with the

04:47:11.730 --> 04:47:14.540
reserve currency, performs the

04:47:14.550 --> 04:47:18.320
function of the source from which

04:47:18.330 --> 04:47:20.720
the state, the Central Bank,

04:47:20.880 --> 04:47:23.040
covers its external debts.

04:47:25.680 --> 04:47:28.300
So, based on this, based on the concepts

04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:31.760
of current transactions and trading

04:47:31.770 --> 04:47:34.280
and capital account, we can find

04:47:34.290 --> 04:47:36.000
out, distinguish, forgive me,

04:47:36.010 --> 04:47:37.480
conversibility on current transactions,

04:47:37.490 --> 04:47:39.740
that is, the absence of restrictions

04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:41.380
on payments and transactions

04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:42.840
on current international

04:47:42.850 --> 04:47:44.660
transactions.

04:47:45.160 --> 04:47:46.300
Accordingly, it can be hard

04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:47.360
and soft.

04:47:48.180 --> 04:47:50.560
If we have a fixed exchange rate

04:47:50.570 --> 04:47:52.720
with you, then the conversibility

04:47:52.730 --> 04:47:55.520
on current transactions is tough.

04:47:56.000 --> 04:48:00.400
If we have a floating exchange rate

04:48:00.410 --> 04:48:02.560
with a regulated floating, then

04:48:02.820 --> 04:48:04.260
the conversibility on current

04:48:04.270 --> 04:48:06.600
transactions is soft.

04:48:07.620 --> 04:48:09.840
First, when entering the International

04:48:09.850 --> 04:48:11.520
Monetary Fund, countries are

04:48:11.840 --> 04:48:14.120
obliged to introduce conversibility

04:48:14.130 --> 04:48:16.340
on current transactions for

04:48:16.350 --> 04:48:18.220
their currency in order to support

04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:19.820
the development of international

04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:21.680
trade relations.

04:48:26.630 --> 04:48:28.290
The factors affecting

04:48:28.300 --> 04:48:30.010
the convertibility of currency on current

04:48:30.020 --> 04:48:32.450
transactions are quite diverse.

04:48:33.010 --> 04:48:36.790
As I have said in previous lectures,

04:48:36.800 --> 04:48:39.890
domestic and external economic

04:48:39.900 --> 04:48:41.830
development definitely affects

04:48:41.840 --> 04:48:45.270
the convertibility

04:48:45.280 --> 04:48:48.610
of currency by current transactions.

04:48:48.770 --> 04:48:50.730
If we have a liberal trade system,

04:48:50.740 --> 04:48:53.590
respectively, the economic

04:48:54.290 --> 04:48:55.450
barriers that contain

04:48:55.460 --> 04:48:57.650
exports and imports are quite

04:48:57.660 --> 04:49:01.030
low, then the rapid development

04:49:01.040 --> 04:49:03.810
of exports and imports leads

04:49:04.370 --> 04:49:08.530
to the stabilization of the

04:49:08.540 --> 04:49:11.250
national economy and economic

04:49:11.260 --> 04:49:12.910
growth and, accordingly,

04:49:12.920 --> 04:49:14.290
to a positive trade and

04:49:14.300 --> 04:49:16.390
payment balance.

04:49:16.510 --> 04:49:18.030
There is an influx of foreign

04:49:18.040 --> 04:49:21.470
currency, of course, at the same

04:49:21.480 --> 04:49:22.910
time there is a growth in

04:49:22.920 --> 04:49:27.090
demand for domestic currency as we export.

04:49:27.100 --> 04:49:29.970
In this case, your goods can be

04:49:29.980 --> 04:49:33.390
paid just from the exchange

04:49:33.400 --> 04:49:35.030
of foreign currency for domestic

04:49:35.040 --> 04:49:36.170
currency.

04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:37.710
And most importantly, there is

04:49:37.720 --> 04:49:39.790
an internal demand in the economy,

04:49:39.800 --> 04:49:42.270
and domestic demand again

04:49:42.280 --> 04:49:45.090
turns into domestic demand

04:49:45.100 --> 04:49:51.450
and is stable and, of course,

04:49:51.460 --> 04:49:55.090
its convertibility

04:49:55.100 --> 04:49:58.370
by current operations grows.

04:50:03.690 --> 04:50:05.090
Capital conversibility implies

04:50:05.100 --> 04:50:08.190
no limitations on payment and

04:50:08.200 --> 04:50:09.690
transfer on the capital

04:50:09.700 --> 04:50:11.250
account, which we have

04:50:11.390 --> 04:50:13.070
considered earlier.

04:50:13.550 --> 04:50:15.290
This implies that the currency

04:50:15.300 --> 04:50:17.130
is convertible for such transactions

04:50:17.140 --> 04:50:19.350
as direct portfolio investments,

04:50:21.810 --> 04:50:23.670
loans, capital grants.

04:50:23.870 --> 04:50:24.930
The requirements of the International

04:50:24.940 --> 04:50:26.030
Monetary Fund do

04:50:26.040 --> 04:50:27.330
not apply to the convertibility

04:50:27.340 --> 04:50:29.390
of capital transactions.

04:50:29.450 --> 04:50:31.610
Moreover, depending on the financial

04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:33.170
economic situation in the domestic

04:50:33.180 --> 04:50:35.170
market of the country,

04:50:35.180 --> 04:50:37.130
one or another, even developed,

04:50:37.140 --> 04:50:39.270
country introduces a restriction

04:50:39.280 --> 04:50:41.350
on convertibility on capital

04:50:41.360 --> 04:50:42.630
transactions.

04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:44.530
And even despite, for example, the

04:50:45.130 --> 04:50:48.350
fact that the US dollar is a solid

04:50:48.360 --> 04:50:51.390
convertible stable currency, but

04:50:51.400 --> 04:50:53.790
in a certain period of time the

04:50:53.800 --> 04:50:56.130
US government introduced

04:50:56.140 --> 04:50:58.390
a limit on convertibility on capital

04:50:58.400 --> 04:50:59.630
transactions.

04:50:59.650 --> 04:51:02.270
This was in the 1970s when

04:51:02.280 --> 04:51:04.970
the global financial

04:51:04.980 --> 04:51:07.030
crisis occurred.

04:51:11.620 --> 04:51:12.880
What are the most typical

04:51:12.890 --> 04:51:15.300
capital account restrictions?

04:51:15.960 --> 04:51:18.920
First of all, this is the restriction

04:51:18.930 --> 04:51:21.260
of objects of foreign direct investment

04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:23.680
in individual industries.

04:51:23.840 --> 04:51:25.740
The state prohibits foreign economic

04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:27.420
agents from investing

04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:31.260
or buying shares of strategic

04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:34.840
enterprises.

04:51:34.900 --> 04:51:37.360
The ban on opening accounts

04:51:37.370 --> 04:51:38.840
in foreign currency in

04:51:38.850 --> 04:51:40.540
foreign banks.

04:51:41.760 --> 04:51:43.560
The following limitation is the requirement

04:51:43.570 --> 04:51:45.180
for compulsory return of profits

04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:47.000
by domestic companies

04:51:47.140 --> 04:51:48.600
investing abroad.

04:51:49.920 --> 04:51:51.660
This requirement usually arises when

04:51:52.100 --> 04:51:55.140
a country’s national exchange rate

04:51:55.150 --> 04:51:57.380
is experiencing difficulties.

04:51:58.000 --> 04:51:59.480
The requirements to transfer or sell

04:51:59.490 --> 04:52:01.960
foreign currency received abroad, such

04:52:01.970 --> 04:52:03.440
a requirement was introduced by

04:52:03.450 --> 04:52:06.640
us and has been in effect for a long time.

04:52:07.540 --> 04:52:09.180
It was introduced by the Central Bank.

04:52:09.720 --> 04:52:12.020
In these conditions, when

04:52:12.030 --> 04:52:13.500
a positive balance of trade

04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:16.000
and payment balance is the

04:52:16.010 --> 04:52:18.960
main positive feature for

04:52:18.970 --> 04:52:22.420
the Russian economy, this

04:52:22.460 --> 04:52:24.800
requirement is undoubtedly removed,

04:52:24.860 --> 04:52:26.940
as is the requirement for the

04:52:26.950 --> 04:52:29.040
obligatory return of profits

04:52:38.530 --> 04:52:40.240
by national companies

04:52:40.320 --> 04:52:42.340
investing in foreign

04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:43.680
securities.

04:52:44.880 --> 04:52:47.440
This restriction at the current stage

04:52:47.450 --> 04:52:50.240
of development of Russia has been

04:52:50.250 --> 04:52:51.940
lifted, and our residents can

04:52:51.950 --> 04:52:53.500
buy foreign securities.

04:52:53.600 --> 04:52:55.880
The restriction is the presentation

04:52:55.890 --> 04:52:58.900
of foreign credit and other.

04:52:59.980 --> 04:53:01.480
In general, the form of capital account

04:53:03.930 --> 04:53:04.420
restrictions is quite diverse.

04:53:06.220 --> 04:53:08.680
Depending on how quickly a country

04:53:08.690 --> 04:53:11.820
is moving towards the full

04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:13.220
convertibility of its currency,

04:53:13.230 --> 04:53:19.260
it removes certain restrictions.

04:53:19.600 --> 04:53:22.520
The general principle is that if we have

04:53:22.530 --> 04:53:25.100
limited convertibility on the account

04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:28.260
of capital, then we have no outflow

04:53:28.270 --> 04:53:29.320
of capital.

04:53:30.120 --> 04:53:32.340
Naturally, such a form of

04:53:32.350 --> 04:53:33.780
restriction will be used primarily

04:53:33.790 --> 04:53:35.680
by transitional economies or developing

04:53:35.690 --> 04:53:38.520
countries, or countries that

04:53:38.530 --> 04:53:40.460
experience problems in

04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:43.100
the national cyclical

04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:45.660
development of economies.

04:53:47.080 --> 04:53:48.680
Full convertibility just implies

04:53:48.690 --> 04:53:50.440
that we have no restrictions,

04:53:50.450 --> 04:53:52.660
no control on both the current

04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:54.880
account and the capital

04:53:54.890 --> 04:53:56.620
account.

04:54:00.840 --> 04:54:02.600
Russia is experiencing a difficult path to

04:54:02.610 --> 04:54:07.020
convertibility of the ruble.

04:54:07.400 --> 04:54:10.400
In Russia’s development programmes for the

04:54:10.410 --> 04:54:13.480
next three years, the Central Bank is

04:54:13.490 --> 04:54:19.640
confused about the goal of bringing

04:54:19.650 --> 04:54:22.160
Russia to full convertibility of the ruble.

04:54:22.240 --> 04:54:24.100
Therefore, the currency liberalization

04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:25.720
is progressively implemented.

04:54:25.820 --> 04:54:28.000
Other restrictions are removed.

04:54:28.600 --> 04:54:32.520
In particular, in this case, one of

04:54:32.530 --> 04:54:34.960
the options that push the recognition

04:54:34.970 --> 04:54:37.440
of the weight to the convertibility

04:54:37.450 --> 04:54:39.740
of the ruble is the law introduced

04:54:39.750 --> 04:54:42.020
by the Central Bank from January

04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:45.220
1, 2007, according to which

04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:47.640
our domestic exporters

04:54:47.650 --> 04:54:51.720
pay taxes to the budget in

04:54:51.730 --> 04:54:54.260
the domestic currency.

04:54:54.320 --> 04:54:56.560
Thus, the exchange of dollars, euros

04:54:56.570 --> 04:54:58.940
against the Russian ruble is stimulated

04:54:58.950 --> 04:55:00.900
and the demand for domestic currency

04:55:00.910 --> 04:55:03.700
is increasing, its stability is affirmed.

04:55:04.420 --> 04:55:07.340
Another measure that is being carried

04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:10.180
out by the Central Bank and, so to

04:55:11.080 --> 04:55:13.100
speak, is going to be gradually introduced

04:55:14.600 --> 04:55:17.100
is to allow domestic citizens,

04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:20.640
domestic national economic

04:55:20.650 --> 04:55:21.840
agents, to open accounts

04:55:21.850 --> 04:55:26.240
abroad in the national currency,

04:55:27.930 --> 04:55:30.880
and in this case this measure

04:55:30.890 --> 04:55:32.700
will mean just the transition

04:55:32.710 --> 04:55:34.520
of the convertibility

04:55:34.530 --> 04:55:36.640
on the account of capital.

04:55:38.720 --> 04:55:40.160
What are the conditions for the transition

04:55:40.170 --> 04:55:41.940
of the full convertibility of the national currency?

04:55:41.950 --> 04:55:43.240
Let us summarize the results.

04:55:43.300 --> 04:55:44.700
This is a difficult task for the government,

04:55:44.710 --> 04:55:46.380
as the convertibility of

04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:47.600
the currency implies stabilization

04:55:48.000 --> 04:55:50.160
of the country’s

04:55:50.170 --> 04:55:52.600
economic development.

04:55:52.720 --> 04:55:54.000
Within macroeconomic stability,

04:55:54.010 --> 04:55:56.240
this is the minimum inflation,

04:55:56.250 --> 04:55:58.620
it is practically the

04:55:58.630 --> 04:56:01.580
minimum unemployment, it

04:56:01.590 --> 04:56:05.340
is a stable economic growth

04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:08.620
within 2-5%, it is a stable state

04:56:08.630 --> 04:56:10.260
budget, it is assumed

04:56:10.420 --> 04:56:12.180
that the state

04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:13.700
budget has not a deficit,

04:56:13.710 --> 04:56:16.200
but a surplus.

04:56:16.210 --> 04:56:18.140
A strict enough credit-monetary

04:56:18.150 --> 04:56:20.580
policy, associated with the

04:56:20.590 --> 04:56:22.420
fact that the Central Bank

04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:24.540
monitors and adopts various

04:56:24.550 --> 04:56:26.380
leverage of monetary policy to

04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:29.840
stabilize the monetary mass economy.

04:56:31.240 --> 04:56:35.740
In general, all these conditions of transition

04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:36.680
to the full convertibility of the

04:56:36.690 --> 04:56:38.600
national currency, one way or another,

04:56:38.610 --> 04:56:41.420
are already implemented in the development

04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:42.980
of the national economy of Russia.

04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:50.070
In March 2007, accumulated

04:56:50.080 --> 04:56:51.830
foreign capital in the Russian

04:56:51.840 --> 04:56:55.830
economy amounted to $151.5

04:56:55.840 --> 04:56:58.730
billion, which is 33% more than

04:56:58.740 --> 04:57:00.650
in the corresponding

04:57:00.660 --> 04:57:01.670
period of the previous

04:57:01.680 --> 04:57:02.750
year.

04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:05.490
This means that confidence in

04:57:05.500 --> 04:57:07.610
the Russian economy is growing, foreign

04:57:07.810 --> 04:57:10.730
investors are willing to take

04:57:10.740 --> 04:57:13.030
risks, hope to reduce risks to

04:57:13.040 --> 04:57:15.870
the national economy and capital

04:57:15.880 --> 04:57:20.830
flows on the account of capital.

04:57:21.730 --> 04:57:23.450
The dynamics of exports and imports

04:57:23.460 --> 04:57:26.350
of the Russian Federation, as we see

04:57:26.360 --> 04:57:28.610
from the scheme presented on the slide,

04:57:29.930 --> 04:57:31.830
also makes us proud of the

04:57:31.840 --> 04:57:34.290
results of the export-import relations

04:57:34.300 --> 04:57:36.170
of the Russian economy.

04:57:37.150 --> 04:57:39.510
The balance of foreign trade, the

04:57:39.520 --> 04:57:41.910
difference between exports

04:57:41.920 --> 04:57:43.810
and imports, which is marked

04:57:43.820 --> 04:57:46.670
by the column chart, is constantly

04:57:46.680 --> 04:57:49.670
positive, which allows for quite

04:57:49.680 --> 04:57:53.210
significant foreign currency flows

04:57:53.220 --> 04:57:55.030
to the territory of Russia and,

04:57:55.040 --> 04:57:58.030
accordingly, allows for the

04:57:58.040 --> 04:58:03.550
gradual transition to the full

04:58:03.560 --> 04:58:06.210
convertibility of the ruble not

04:58:06.220 --> 04:58:08.230
only on export-import operations,

04:58:08.240 --> 04:58:13.390
but also on capital flows.

04:58:21.520 --> 04:58:22.900
There are other characteristics

04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:24.580
of convertibility such as internal

04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:26.600
convertibility and external

04:58:26.610 --> 04:58:28.180
convertibility.

04:58:28.360 --> 04:58:30.900
The first step in the stabilization

04:58:30.910 --> 04:58:33.440
process of the national currency is

04:58:33.450 --> 04:58:36.180
the development of measures on internal

04:58:36.190 --> 04:58:38.080
convertibility, i.e. the right

04:58:38.090 --> 04:58:39.300
of residents to buy, have

04:58:39.310 --> 04:58:41.380
and carry out transactions

04:58:41.390 --> 04:58:44.380
within the country with assets in

04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:45.820
foreign currency.

04:58:45.940 --> 04:58:47.920
Otherwise, it is assumed that if domestic

04:58:47.930 --> 04:58:49.020
convertibility is introduced,

04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:50.840
then our buyers can exchange

04:58:50.850 --> 04:58:57.260
rubles for euros and pay for

04:58:57.270 --> 04:59:01.360
their transactions, buy

04:59:01.480 --> 04:59:04.100
goods in foreign currency,

04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:06.320
that is, in dollars

04:59:06.330 --> 04:59:08.220
or euros.

04:59:09.160 --> 04:59:10.340
Moreover, domestic

04:59:10.350 --> 04:59:14.240
convertibility implies that

04:59:14.250 --> 04:59:17.680
domestic economic agents

04:59:17.690 --> 04:59:20.860
can open foreign currency

04:59:20.870 --> 04:59:21.840
accounts.

04:59:22.700 --> 04:59:24.340
There is indeed one major

04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:25.420
problem here.

04:59:26.760 --> 04:59:27.980
The Russian ruble is internally

04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:31.500
convertible, a period of crisis

04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:33.880
in the development of the

04:59:33.890 --> 04:59:35.680
Russian economy.

04:59:36.100 --> 04:59:39.240
Our prices were set in dollars

04:59:39.250 --> 04:59:41.100
or in so-called conventional

04:59:41.110 --> 04:59:42.760
units.

04:59:43.100 --> 04:59:44.460
The US dollar served

04:59:44.470 --> 04:59:47.080
as a measure of value.

04:59:48.180 --> 04:59:49.740
Often, many stores applied

04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:52.780
to payments just the dollar instead

04:59:52.790 --> 04:59:54.860
of the ruble.

04:59:55.100 --> 04:59:56.620
It served as a payment

04:59:56.630 --> 04:59:58.280
instrument.

04:59:58.840 --> 05:00:00.680
Moreover, most citizens accumulated

05:00:00.690 --> 05:00:03.520
their savings again - not in

05:00:03.530 --> 05:00:05.100
rubles, but in dollars.

05:00:06.160 --> 05:00:08.520
As you can see, it turns out that

05:00:08.530 --> 05:00:09.980
such internal convertibility

05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:15.000
occurs precisely when the economy is unstable.

05:00:15.240 --> 05:00:17.000
Internal convertibility

05:00:17.010 --> 05:00:18.460
is the freedom of citizens to

05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:21.740
accumulate their savings

05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:25.360
in one or another currency.

05:00:25.370 --> 05:00:28.280
As soon as the Russian ruble became

05:00:28.290 --> 05:00:31.240
more solid, more stable in its

05:00:31.250 --> 05:00:33.540
development, the reverse

05:00:33.550 --> 05:00:34.900
trend occurred.

05:00:37.740 --> 05:00:39.260
According to the current assessment of the Central

05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:43.420
Bank of Russia, there is a boost

05:00:43.430 --> 05:00:45.880
in the preferences of Russian investors.

05:00:45.890 --> 05:00:48.680
Current current accounts are opened

05:00:48.690 --> 05:00:51.520
in the ruble equivalent, while the

05:00:51.530 --> 05:00:54.340
accumulation in the dollar or the

05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:57.760
euro equivalent is not growing

05:00:57.770 --> 05:00:59.240
at such a great rate.

05:01:00.660 --> 05:01:02.300
In modern conditions, as you

05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:04.400
can see, the main feature of

05:01:04.410 --> 05:01:05.700
the internal convertibility

05:01:05.710 --> 05:01:07.940
of the Russian ruble is the right

05:01:07.950 --> 05:01:09.800
of Russian citizens to open foreign

05:01:09.810 --> 05:01:13.040
exchange accounts in euros, dollars,

05:01:13.200 --> 05:01:14.740
as such, in various banks,

05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:16.840
national banks.

05:01:16.880 --> 05:01:19.160
The external convertibility.

05:01:19.420 --> 05:01:21.560
This is the right of residents to make

05:01:21.570 --> 05:01:24.360
transactions with foreign currency, with non-residents.

05:01:24.940 --> 05:01:28.600
Here is exactly the currency of the

05:01:33.090 --> 05:01:34.840
ruble in this case gradually begins

05:01:39.120 --> 05:01:42.460
to be implemented, and this external convertibility.

05:01:42.660 --> 05:01:46.040
The main task is that the Russian

05:01:46.050 --> 05:01:49.400
ruble gradually became an internationally

05:01:49.410 --> 05:01:50.840
recognized currency and

05:01:50.850 --> 05:01:54.300
became not only a stable,

05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:56.760
solid, but also a reserve

05:01:56.770 --> 05:01:58.080
currency.

05:01:58.280 --> 05:01:59.720
To this issue I will actually go back a little

05:01:59.730 --> 05:02:00.280
further.

05:02:03.840 --> 05:02:05.900
So, residents are bound,

05:02:06.840 --> 05:02:07.880
use domestic convertibility,

05:02:07.890 --> 05:02:09.220
as I said, can

05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:10.260
use foreign currency.

05:02:10.270 --> 05:02:11.760


05:02:12.120 --> 05:02:14.180
And the question of internal

05:02:14.190 --> 05:02:17.220
convertibility is related to the question

05:02:17.230 --> 05:02:19.620
of dollarization or, if you want, the

05:02:20.100 --> 05:02:22.560
euro-realisation of the national currency

05:02:22.570 --> 05:02:25.900
market and the possibility of a situation

05:02:25.960 --> 05:02:27.880
where parallel circulation or

05:02:27.890 --> 05:02:30.320
currency substitution occurs.

05:02:30.720 --> 05:02:32.960
There are regimes of national

05:02:32.970 --> 05:02:35.440
currency systems of countries usually

05:02:35.450 --> 05:02:36.800
developing, when the

05:02:36.810 --> 05:02:38.600
legislative way allows the parallel

05:02:38.610 --> 05:02:40.420
circulation of several currencies.

05:02:40.480 --> 05:02:41.960
For example, the national currency

05:02:41.970 --> 05:02:42.880
and, let’s say, the dollar.

05:02:43.880 --> 05:02:48.400
Or, let’s say, national and grass.

05:02:48.860 --> 05:02:49.980
Or the ruble.

05:02:50.560 --> 05:02:52.840
So, such a parallel, so to speak,

05:02:52.850 --> 05:02:54.160
officially recognized appeal,

05:02:54.170 --> 05:02:56.460
in general, is a completely

05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:57.840
normal situation.

05:02:58.380 --> 05:03:00.320
It is assumed that the currency and

05:03:00.330 --> 05:03:02.620
financial authorities of the country

05:03:02.630 --> 05:03:05.020
have the ability to control this situation.

05:03:05.140 --> 05:03:07.100
If there is a dollarization or replacement

05:03:07.110 --> 05:03:09.420
by a foreign currency of the functions

05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:11.280
of the national currency, namely,

05:03:11.290 --> 05:03:13.640
not only the accumulation function,

05:03:13.650 --> 05:03:15.580
the means of accumulation, namely the

05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:17.400
function of the exchange, payment,

05:03:17.540 --> 05:03:19.540
measure of value, then this is, of

05:03:25.720 --> 05:03:28.720
course, a very bad such dollarization.

05:03:29.200 --> 05:03:31.700
The reason why the European Union,

05:03:31.710 --> 05:03:33.980
for example, at some certain stage of its

05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:36.060
development decided to introduce a single

05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:38.280
system, a single currency supported

05:03:38.290 --> 05:03:39.620
by all the countries of the

05:03:39.630 --> 05:03:43.060
European Union, is just dollarization.

05:03:43.180 --> 05:03:45.680
That is, not only on current accounts,

05:03:45.690 --> 05:03:47.780
but on capital accounts at

05:03:49.260 --> 05:03:53.380
the end of the 20th century,

05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:55.660
a fairly large amount of dollars

05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:58.860
in Europe, euro-dollars, accumulated.

05:03:59.520 --> 05:04:02.860
In this case, such a accumulation of dollars

05:04:02.870 --> 05:04:05.020
was not a positive trend in the development

05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:06.460
of the European monetary and financial

05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:08.240
system, since such an accumulation

05:04:08.440 --> 05:04:12.760
implies parallel or currency

05:04:12.770 --> 05:04:16.060
replacement in the least

05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:18.000
developed countries of

05:04:18.010 --> 05:04:19.920
the European Union.

05:04:21.240 --> 05:04:24.380
Nowadays, of course, the introduction

05:04:25.120 --> 05:04:28.080
of the euro, its stabilization leads

05:04:28.090 --> 05:04:31.520
to the fact that the dollars for

05:04:31.530 --> 05:04:33.840
residents have ceased to be

05:04:33.850 --> 05:04:36.100
the same means of saving, and

05:04:36.110 --> 05:04:38.420
Europeans prefer their native euro

05:04:38.430 --> 05:04:42.700
to create some reserves.

05:04:43.060 --> 05:04:44.540
What I will repeat is happening

05:04:44.550 --> 05:04:45.280
in Russia.

05:04:45.620 --> 05:04:48.120
There is a displacement of the dollar from

05:04:48.130 --> 05:04:51.180
the reserves of citizens, and moreover,

05:04:51.420 --> 05:04:55.180
payments in the stores exist in the

05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:56.260
national currency.

05:04:56.740 --> 05:04:58.220
However, it should be stressed here

05:04:59.200 --> 05:05:01.060
that the ban on foreign

05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:04.500
currency payments was introduced

05:05:04.510 --> 05:05:08.080
on the basis of state intervention.

05:05:08.100 --> 05:05:09.520
It is prohibited to make payments

05:05:09.530 --> 05:05:11.660
in foreign currency, it is only

05:05:11.680 --> 05:05:13.620
allowed in your national currency.

05:05:13.630 --> 05:05:14.780
This was a measure that

05:05:14.790 --> 05:05:17.360
would counteract currency replacement.

05:05:17.440 --> 05:05:19.320
But in modern conditions, such a measure,

05:05:19.330 --> 05:05:21.080
even if the law had been abolished

05:05:21.090 --> 05:05:23.160
on the requirement to pay only in

05:05:23.170 --> 05:05:25.580
the national currency, would not

05:05:25.590 --> 05:05:26.980
have received a large

05:05:26.990 --> 05:05:28.540
spread of replacement.

05:05:28.600 --> 05:05:30.140
That is, Russian citizens are already

05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:32.200
accustomed to prices in Russian

05:05:32.210 --> 05:05:34.700
rubles and to payments in Russian

05:05:34.710 --> 05:05:36.700
rubles, as I have already said, even

05:05:37.160 --> 05:05:39.640
in the accumulation of national rubles.

05:05:42.480 --> 05:05:44.800
In principle, currency systems can

05:05:44.810 --> 05:05:47.120
be divided into three large groups.

05:05:47.300 --> 05:05:51.280
It is global, regional and national.

05:05:52.980 --> 05:05:55.180
As you can see, the regional

05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:57.420
currency system is primarily

05:05:57.430 --> 05:06:00.060
represented by the euro area.

05:06:00.960 --> 05:06:03.480
The global currency system has its

05:06:03.490 --> 05:06:05.660
own features and features.

05:06:05.900 --> 05:06:07.160
It is related to the implementation

05:06:07.170 --> 05:06:08.320
of international currency

05:06:08.330 --> 05:06:11.280
regulation and the action of various

05:06:11.290 --> 05:06:13.580
international currency organizations.

05:06:14.440 --> 05:06:15.660
We have already talked about

05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:17.940
the national currency system to some

05:06:17.950 --> 05:06:19.880
extent.

05:06:20.260 --> 05:06:24.500
So, what are the main differences between

05:06:24.700 --> 05:06:28.400
national and global currency systems?

05:06:28.740 --> 05:06:30.360
The basis of the national currency

05:06:30.370 --> 05:06:32.820
system is the national currency.

05:06:32.860 --> 05:06:34.700
The basis of the global currency system

05:06:34.710 --> 05:06:36.920
is the reserve currencies.

05:06:37.120 --> 05:06:39.880
In this case, when such a powerful

05:06:39.890 --> 05:06:41.960
international monetary organization

05:06:41.970 --> 05:06:43.160
as the International Monetary

05:06:43.170 --> 05:06:45.360
Fund was organized, it was precisely

05:06:45.370 --> 05:06:48.780
the one that introduced a substitute

05:06:48.790 --> 05:06:52.460
for such a world currency, namely

05:06:52.470 --> 05:06:54.320
special borrowing rights.

05:06:54.800 --> 05:06:56.680
These securities are, in

05:06:56.690 --> 05:06:59.840
fact, absolutely liquid,

05:07:00.020 --> 05:07:01.840
absolutely convertible

05:07:01.850 --> 05:07:04.720
assets.

05:07:05.540 --> 05:07:08.520
And practically for final mutual

05:07:08.530 --> 05:07:12.120
settlements, countries that are members

05:07:12.130 --> 05:07:13.340
of the Commonwealth of the

05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:15.140
International Monetary

05:07:15.150 --> 05:07:17.980
Fund can be counted not only as

05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:21.080
a foreign, solid, stable convertible

05:07:21.090 --> 05:07:22.980
currency, but as part

05:07:22.990 --> 05:07:24.660
of special borrowing rights.

05:07:24.680 --> 05:07:26.180
But this is, of course, the extreme

05:07:26.680 --> 05:07:28.520
option, since each member country

05:07:28.530 --> 05:07:32.580
of the IMF values its SDRs, as they

05:07:32.590 --> 05:07:38.560
are the basis of its currency reserves.

05:07:39.020 --> 05:07:42.160
Other such elements of the currency

05:07:42.170 --> 05:07:44.040
system are the conditions of

05:07:44.050 --> 05:07:45.340
convertibility of the national currency,

05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:46.760
and for the International Monetary

05:07:46.770 --> 05:07:48.380
System the conditions of mutual convertibility

05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:50.780
of currencies on the basis of

05:07:50.790 --> 05:07:52.160
the same special rights of

05:07:52.170 --> 05:07:53.680
borrowing or SDR.

05:07:54.380 --> 05:07:56.640
The next component of the system is the

05:07:56.650 --> 05:07:58.940
parity of the national currency.

05:07:58.980 --> 05:08:01.200
Accordingly, a unified regime of

05:08:01.210 --> 05:08:03.400
currency parities was developed for

05:08:04.800 --> 05:08:08.100
the SDR, which are the basis of

05:08:08.110 --> 05:08:10.000
interrelated currency rates.

05:08:10.000 --> 05:08:13.060
The main element is the currency

05:08:13.070 --> 05:08:15.740
rate regime.

05:08:20.010 --> 05:08:22.350
In this case, the world currency

05:08:22.360 --> 05:08:23.910
system is assumed to be developing

05:08:23.920 --> 05:08:25.850
some rules of regulation of

05:08:25.860 --> 05:08:27.750
the regime of national exchange

05:08:27.760 --> 05:08:29.850
rates for their more correct

05:08:29.860 --> 05:08:31.110
definition.

05:08:32.350 --> 05:08:35.190
In principle, without listing

05:08:35.200 --> 05:08:37.210
the remaining main elements

05:08:37.220 --> 05:08:38.970
of the currency system, which you

05:08:38.980 --> 05:08:42.150
can read in this table, we note

05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:44.830
that the main criterion of the

05:08:44.840 --> 05:08:46.370
national currency system is

05:08:46.380 --> 05:08:48.990
that the national currency,

05:08:49.000 --> 05:08:50.730
the national currency system

05:08:50.740 --> 05:08:52.630
is regulated, regulated

05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:54.430
by its development by

05:08:54.440 --> 05:08:55.750
national bodies.

05:08:56.810 --> 05:08:58.850
In contrast to this system,

05:08:58.860 --> 05:09:00.230
the world currency system

05:09:00.240 --> 05:09:01.930
implies that international currency

05:09:01.940 --> 05:09:04.070
organizations, such as the International

05:09:04.080 --> 05:09:05.750
Bank for Reconstruction and Development,

05:09:05.760 --> 05:09:07.270
the International Monetary Fund,

05:09:07.280 --> 05:09:08.690
which were created to regulate

05:09:08.700 --> 05:09:11.050
currency relations between

05:09:11.060 --> 05:09:13.170
countries, they try to regulate,

05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:16.210
order currency-financial relations

05:09:16.290 --> 05:09:18.630
between the countries that

05:09:18.640 --> 05:09:21.190
are members of the International

05:09:21.200 --> 05:09:23.350
Monetary Fund.

05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:25.370
The next component of the currency

05:09:25.380 --> 05:09:27.850
system is currency parity.

05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:29.110
What is this?

05:09:29.230 --> 05:09:30.930
This is the ratio of the value of two

05:09:30.940 --> 05:09:33.610
currencies expressed through the third means.

05:09:33.620 --> 05:09:35.950
This is a kind of basis that

05:09:35.960 --> 05:09:41.510
allows the central bank to identify

05:09:41.520 --> 05:09:44.190
the average component around

05:09:44.210 --> 05:09:46.510
which the exchange rate will

05:09:46.520 --> 05:09:49.510
eventually fluctuate.

05:09:49.520 --> 05:09:54.830
What is the basis on which

05:09:54.840 --> 05:09:57.270
currency parity is calculated?

05:09:57.710 --> 05:09:59.470
These are global reserves.

05:10:00.150 --> 05:10:02.130
In ancient times, gold and

05:10:02.140 --> 05:10:03.950
silver were such reserves.

05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:07.430
At present, gold has retained its reserve

05:10:07.440 --> 05:10:09.530
function, despite the fact that

05:10:09.540 --> 05:10:12.770
gold has ceased to be a means of

05:10:12.780 --> 05:10:14.630
exchange or payment, there are no

05:10:14.640 --> 05:10:16.810
gold coins, but nevertheless all the

05:10:16.820 --> 05:10:19.530
central banks of the world hold

05:10:19.540 --> 05:10:21.830
in their gold reserves gold,

05:10:21.840 --> 05:10:26.630
as that value that can be the means

05:10:26.640 --> 05:10:29.430
of final settlements between countries

05:10:29.440 --> 05:10:31.250
in the negative trade balance

05:10:31.260 --> 05:10:34.130
and falling rates of national

05:10:34.140 --> 05:10:37.570
and foreign currencies,

05:10:37.580 --> 05:10:39.110
that is, in the financial

05:10:39.120 --> 05:10:40.730
crisis.

05:10:41.210 --> 05:10:43.310
If we recall the situation of the

05:10:44.880 --> 05:10:47.750
70s, when the currency and financial crisis

05:10:47.760 --> 05:10:50.530
occurred, then as we remember, at

05:10:50.540 --> 05:10:53.050
this time the collapse of the Bratenwood

05:10:53.060 --> 05:10:54.390
system occurred.

05:10:54.410 --> 05:10:58.210
The system in which the US dollar was

05:10:58.220 --> 05:11:00.110
calculated on the currency parity

05:11:00.120 --> 05:11:01.910
to gold, that is, had gold content,

05:11:01.920 --> 05:11:04.690
and all the leading countries in the

05:11:04.700 --> 05:11:06.170
world equated their currencies

05:11:06.180 --> 05:11:07.710
to the dollar, and in relation

05:11:07.720 --> 05:11:11.650
to it calculated the value content

05:11:11.660 --> 05:11:13.190
of their currency.

05:11:13.200 --> 05:11:14.690
So at this time, when in the 1970s

05:11:14.870 --> 05:11:18.110
Europe was over-saturated with euros

05:11:18.120 --> 05:11:20.250
and dollars, the central banks

05:11:20.810 --> 05:11:23.350
of the future European Union

05:11:23.360 --> 05:11:26.910
practically bought dollars to

05:11:26.920 --> 05:11:30.390
then exchange them in the central

05:11:30.400 --> 05:11:32.990
bank of the United States for

05:11:33.000 --> 05:11:34.110
gold.

05:11:34.330 --> 05:11:35.990
And during this period of time,

05:11:36.000 --> 05:11:38.870
the US spent 50% of its gold

05:11:38.880 --> 05:11:40.590
reserves to restore the

05:11:40.600 --> 05:11:42.210
financial system.

05:11:42.220 --> 05:11:45.430
In order to prevent this from happening

05:11:45.440 --> 05:11:47.710
again, the International Monetary

05:11:47.720 --> 05:11:50.450
Fund created special borrowing

05:11:50.460 --> 05:11:51.830
rights, i.e. a system in which

05:11:51.840 --> 05:11:54.210
the world’s leading countries,

05:11:54.220 --> 05:11:55.970
members of the International Monetary

05:11:55.980 --> 05:11:59.350
Fund, invested solid currencies

05:11:59.360 --> 05:12:01.630
in the International Monetary

05:12:01.640 --> 05:12:03.390
Fund, in particular Russia,

05:12:03.400 --> 05:12:04.790
when joining the International

05:12:04.800 --> 05:12:07.950
Monetary Fund, offered gold

05:12:07.960 --> 05:12:10.210
as reserves, since at that

05:12:10.220 --> 05:12:13.250
time it did not have convertible

05:12:13.260 --> 05:12:15.550
currencies to provide

05:12:15.560 --> 05:12:17.290
such reserves.

05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:20.270
What is the SDR Special Borrowing Rights?

05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:23.330
In fact, they are sometimes called paper

05:12:23.340 --> 05:12:25.290
money, that is, it is some securities,

05:12:25.300 --> 05:12:27.230
it is virtual securities, it is

05:12:27.240 --> 05:12:29.210
a record on the accounts of the

05:12:29.220 --> 05:12:31.350
International Monetary Fund and a

05:12:31.360 --> 05:12:34.370
corrected record on the accounts of

05:12:34.380 --> 05:12:36.830
the central banks of countries.

05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:39.690
But it is considered

05:12:39.700 --> 05:12:41.710
the most convertible currency,

05:12:41.720 --> 05:12:44.030
and in this case countries can

05:12:44.040 --> 05:12:46.030
pay for just these securities

05:12:46.040 --> 05:12:48.350
with special borrowing rights.

05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:50.130
Basically, of course, they are

05:12:50.140 --> 05:12:52.410
not rejected, kept and probably

05:12:52.530 --> 05:12:54.310
resorted to them at the last moment.

05:12:56.590 --> 05:13:00.710
What else is in the world reserves?

05:13:01.050 --> 05:13:03.290
This is a foreign currency, another

05:13:03.300 --> 05:13:04.830
name is a currency.

05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:07.310
I will return to this issue later.

05:13:07.320 --> 05:13:09.190
Now the second point that could still

05:13:09.200 --> 05:13:12.410
be included in the calculation of parity.

05:13:12.930 --> 05:13:15.910
There is also a variant of such a calculated

05:13:15.920 --> 05:13:19.150
parity of the exchange rate, when

05:13:19.160 --> 05:13:21.690
exchange rates are compared on the

05:13:21.700 --> 05:13:23.690
basket, on purchasing power,

05:13:23.700 --> 05:13:28.090
the possibility to buy goods in one

05:13:28.100 --> 05:13:29.890
country and in another country for

05:13:29.900 --> 05:13:31.830
their currency and for foreign

05:13:31.840 --> 05:13:33.230
currency.

05:13:33.240 --> 05:13:35.250
The parity of purchasing

05:13:35.260 --> 05:13:38.170
power implies a calculated

05:13:38.180 --> 05:13:40.190
exchange rate, which is

05:13:40.250 --> 05:13:42.210
called a real exchange rate.

05:13:42.220 --> 05:13:42.490
Why is?

05:13:42.570 --> 05:13:44.490
Because it takes into account the level

05:13:44.500 --> 05:13:47.090
of inflation in foreign countries and

05:13:47.100 --> 05:13:48.710
in the home country.

05:13:48.810 --> 05:13:50.290
Thus, most clearly, unlike

05:13:50.300 --> 05:13:51.990
the market exchange rate,

05:13:52.000 --> 05:13:53.710
which is influenced by demand

05:13:53.720 --> 05:13:55.770
and supply, shows the real

05:13:55.780 --> 05:13:58.150
purchasing power of a country.

05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:59.570
In particular, by the parity

05:13:59.580 --> 05:14:01.410
of purchasing power, the exchange

05:14:01.420 --> 05:14:03.970
rate of Russia should be not about

05:14:03.980 --> 05:14:07.030
25 rubles per dollar, but only

05:14:07.040 --> 05:14:07.870
15.

05:14:08.130 --> 05:14:10.310
That is, purchasing power is

05:14:10.320 --> 05:14:12.210
strong enough because we have

05:14:12.290 --> 05:14:13.630
a fairly high export,

05:14:13.640 --> 05:14:15.750
although, in general, recently

05:14:15.760 --> 05:14:17.910
and high imports.

05:14:19.870 --> 05:14:21.730
Purchasing power parity is calculated

05:14:21.740 --> 05:14:24.890
by different methods.

05:14:24.900 --> 05:14:27.450
As I said, you can count through

05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:30.610
comparable baskets of goods.

05:14:30.620 --> 05:14:32.870
It is clear that these should

05:14:32.880 --> 05:14:34.570
not be goods of local consumption

05:14:34.580 --> 05:14:36.530
that are not related to

05:14:36.540 --> 05:14:40.290
international preferences.

05:14:40.590 --> 05:14:42.330
This is the product that

05:14:42.450 --> 05:14:45.190
is consumed in any country.

05:14:45.310 --> 05:14:47.790
And the simplest example is the

05:14:47.800 --> 05:14:50.030
establishment of parity for

05:14:50.040 --> 05:14:52.550
a single product, which is distributed

05:14:52.560 --> 05:14:54.010
all over the world.

05:14:54.030 --> 05:14:56.110
In this regard, McDonald’s can be

05:14:56.120 --> 05:14:57.830
proud that one of the options for calculating

05:14:57.840 --> 05:14:59.410
the purchasing power parity –

05:14:59.420 --> 05:15:00.890
though, the most approximate –

05:15:00.900 --> 05:15:03.170
is the ratio of prices to hamburgers

05:15:03.180 --> 05:15:04.730
in different countries.

05:15:04.810 --> 05:15:06.530
Depending on the price ratio,

05:15:06.540 --> 05:15:09.490
you can calculate the most

05:15:09.500 --> 05:15:14.390
correct, more adequate exchange

05:15:14.400 --> 05:15:16.150
rate or real exchange

05:15:16.160 --> 05:15:17.210
rate.

05:15:17.330 --> 05:15:19.330
In statistics, the central

05:15:19.370 --> 05:15:20.810
bank calculates the parity

05:15:20.820 --> 05:15:25.210
of the purchasing power of a currency

05:15:25.220 --> 05:15:28.110
by more complex methods, as

05:15:28.120 --> 05:15:29.670
I said, through price

05:15:29.680 --> 05:15:30.610
indices.

05:15:30.810 --> 05:15:34.150
This is due to the changes in

05:15:34.160 --> 05:15:38.530
inflation in the country and

05:15:38.540 --> 05:15:40.070
abroad.

05:15:40.750 --> 05:15:42.890
The next component of the currency

05:15:42.900 --> 05:15:44.710
system is the currency standard.

05:15:45.550 --> 05:15:46.270
What is it?

05:15:46.290 --> 05:15:49.010
This is a currency parity system.

05:15:49.690 --> 05:15:51.530
That is, every country, every

05:15:51.540 --> 05:15:58.490
government, the central bank or what

05:15:58.500 --> 05:16:00.330
will eventually lie in the same reserves

05:16:00.340 --> 05:16:03.950
of the country as in the case

05:16:03.960 --> 05:16:07.370
of calculations, which

05:16:07.380 --> 05:16:10.290
reserves will have to be abandoned.

05:16:11.170 --> 05:16:13.230
The oldest standard was the

05:16:13.240 --> 05:16:14.870
metal standard, that is, the

05:16:14.880 --> 05:16:17.910
same gold, silver and so on.

05:16:18.070 --> 05:16:20.450
In principle, the gold standard was

05:16:20.460 --> 05:16:24.250
introduced in the 20th century twice, this

05:16:24.260 --> 05:16:26.710
was in the pre-war period, and some

05:16:26.720 --> 05:16:28.430
short time in a number of countries after

05:16:28.440 --> 05:16:30.730
the war, but eventually it was abandoned.

05:16:31.250 --> 05:16:34.190
Even after the 1970s crisis, the

05:16:34.290 --> 05:16:35.670
currency and financial crisis,

05:16:35.790 --> 05:16:37.830
gold was said to have ceased

05:16:37.840 --> 05:16:40.550
to be the world’s most valuable money

05:16:40.560 --> 05:16:42.090
and means of payment, because

05:16:42.100 --> 05:16:44.030
it has low liquidity.

05:16:44.350 --> 05:16:46.590
But the metal standard

05:16:46.600 --> 05:16:48.890
has remained to some extent.

05:16:48.930 --> 05:16:49.270
Why is?

05:16:49.370 --> 05:16:50.790
Because it is now included

05:16:50.800 --> 05:16:51.770
in a more modern type

05:16:51.780 --> 05:16:53.090
of gold standard.

05:16:53.110 --> 05:16:55.590
What is the Division Standard,

05:16:55.710 --> 05:16:56.930
the Modern Standard?

05:16:57.050 --> 05:17:01.230
In this case, the currency is

05:17:01.240 --> 05:17:05.670
selected in relation to some currencies.

05:17:05.680 --> 05:17:07.690
You can choose a currency parity in

05:17:07.700 --> 05:17:09.490
relation to one currency, you can

05:17:09.500 --> 05:17:11.550
in relation to a basket of currencies,

05:17:11.560 --> 05:17:12.890
you can only special borrowing

05:17:12.900 --> 05:17:14.870
rights, you can gold currency,

05:17:14.880 --> 05:17:16.290
special borrowing rights,

05:17:16.300 --> 05:17:17.690
and so on.

05:17:19.290 --> 05:17:21.330
If you pay attention to the

05:17:21.340 --> 05:17:23.010
state of gold and foreign exchange reserves

05:17:23.020 --> 05:17:27.570
in Russia and look at what solid

05:17:27.580 --> 05:17:30.410
currencies they consist of, then until

05:17:31.980 --> 05:17:34.490
recently the main reserve

05:17:34.500 --> 05:17:36.610
currency, in addition to

05:17:36.620 --> 05:17:38.610
special borrowing rights and gold,

05:17:38.620 --> 05:17:40.050
was the dollar.

05:17:40.060 --> 05:17:43.190
However, such a dependence on the dollar

05:17:43.200 --> 05:17:46.430
in the situation of instability

05:17:46.440 --> 05:17:49.310
and various political fluctuations

05:17:49.320 --> 05:17:51.010
in the United States is quite

05:17:51.020 --> 05:17:54.990
dangerous for any currency

05:17:55.000 --> 05:17:56.750
system.

05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:59.770
Accordingly, as soon as the opportunity

05:17:59.780 --> 05:18:03.030
arose to replenish the country's

05:18:03.040 --> 05:18:06.230
reserves with a solid European

05:18:06.240 --> 05:18:08.210
currency, European currencies

05:18:08.220 --> 05:18:14.570
began to be included.

05:18:14.580 --> 05:18:17.370
In the current conditions, when

05:18:17.380 --> 05:18:20.030
the euro area was formed, the currency

05:18:20.040 --> 05:18:24.510
component is 45% of the dollar and

05:18:24.520 --> 05:18:30.370
the euro, and 10% relates to the

05:18:30.380 --> 05:18:32.870
pound sterling as a fairly

05:18:32.880 --> 05:18:35.050
solid and stable currency.

05:18:35.060 --> 05:18:37.410
In principle, if you look at the

05:18:37.420 --> 05:18:40.610
value of gold and currency reserves,

05:18:40.850 --> 05:18:44.750
then in fact the value of the euro is 60%

05:18:44.760 --> 05:18:48.630
of our currency reserves, and accordingly

05:18:48.640 --> 05:18:51.470
the value of the dollar is much

05:18:51.480 --> 05:18:53.590
lower.

05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:57.530
The supplementation of our gold and currency

05:18:57.540 --> 05:19:00.510
reserves may be the flow of Japanese yen.

05:19:00.520 --> 05:19:03.370
This was announced in October

05:19:03.380 --> 05:19:06.690
2006 and the Japanese Finance

05:19:06.700 --> 05:19:09.610
Minister noted with satisfaction

05:19:09.620 --> 05:19:12.130
such a trend in Russian

05:19:12.140 --> 05:19:15.510
financial and monetary policy.

05:19:16.210 --> 05:19:18.230
But the exact content of the Japanese

05:19:18.240 --> 05:19:19.810
yen in the currency component

05:19:19.820 --> 05:19:23.590
is not announced.

05:19:23.600 --> 05:19:25.450
Well, apparently, just that 10% along

05:19:25.460 --> 05:19:28.010
with the pound sterling may

05:19:28.020 --> 05:19:30.350
and will be held by the Japanese

05:19:30.360 --> 05:19:31.430
yen.

05:19:31.850 --> 05:19:34.050
However, it is said that, given

05:19:36.480 --> 05:19:40.910
that the factory of the world and

05:19:40.920 --> 05:19:44.110
the main export partner of many

05:19:44.120 --> 05:19:46.370
countries in the world is China, some

05:19:47.050 --> 05:19:50.530
countries are thinking about including

05:19:50.540 --> 05:19:53.710
the Chinese currency yuan in the

05:19:53.720 --> 05:19:56.350
currency component of their

05:19:56.360 --> 05:19:56.990
countries.

05:19:57.290 --> 05:19:59.930
But this decision has not yet been made.

05:20:03.140 --> 05:20:05.660
The next component of the currency

05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:07.420
system is the currency regime.

05:20:09.180 --> 05:20:13.120
And depending on how developed a

05:20:13.130 --> 05:20:15.020
country is, or so to say,

05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:17.200
developing, what types of domestic

05:20:17.210 --> 05:20:18.900
economic policy it conducts, one

05:20:18.910 --> 05:20:21.460
or the other country adheres to

05:20:21.470 --> 05:20:25.340
different options of flexibility

05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:27.460
of the exchange rate.

05:20:28.100 --> 05:20:30.000
At least we can look

05:20:30.010 --> 05:20:32.480
at the slide.

05:20:32.500 --> 05:20:35.680
There are three flexibility options.

05:20:35.800 --> 05:20:37.360
The most extreme option is a tightly

05:20:37.370 --> 05:20:39.320
fixed exchange rate.

05:20:39.700 --> 05:20:42.780
Another opposite side of currency

05:20:42.790 --> 05:20:44.660
flexibility is the freely floating

05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:46.060
exchange rate.

05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:48.060
This is perfect swimming.

05:20:48.440 --> 05:20:50.300
And in the meantime, regulated

05:20:50.310 --> 05:20:52.600
swimming, which was just in the 70s received

05:20:52.610 --> 05:20:55.020
the term "dirty swimming", that

05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:56.340
is, swimming, related to the state

05:20:56.420 --> 05:20:57.680
interventions of the Central

05:20:57.690 --> 05:20:59.560
Bank on the currency market with

05:20:59.570 --> 05:21:01.660
the purchase of the sale of currency

05:21:01.670 --> 05:21:02.880
and, accordingly, the maintenance

05:21:03.060 --> 05:21:05.220
of one or another degree of

05:21:05.230 --> 05:21:06.820
its domestic currency.

05:21:12.340 --> 05:21:13.920
A hardly fixed exchange rate,

05:21:13.930 --> 05:21:17.880
although it seems that

05:21:17.890 --> 05:21:19.340
in the modern world countries

05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:21.800
should abandon it, yet it has

05:21:21.810 --> 05:21:23.020
certain advantages,

05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:24.640
which we will talk about

05:21:24.650 --> 05:21:25.740
later.

05:21:27.220 --> 05:21:28.580
In particular, for example, China

05:21:28.800 --> 05:21:31.880
has a tightly fixed exchange rate,

05:21:31.890 --> 05:21:34.380
which allows to reduce the exchange

05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:37.640
rate, the exchange rate of the

05:21:37.650 --> 05:21:40.000
Chinese yuan against the United

05:21:40.010 --> 05:21:41.020
States.

05:21:41.680 --> 05:21:44.020
Although, ideally, as I said, the exchange

05:21:44.200 --> 05:21:45.740
rate should rise, because in terms

05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:47.320
of purchasing power parity

05:21:47.330 --> 05:21:48.740
it is much higher, precisely

05:21:48.750 --> 05:21:51.020
because China is now leading

05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:52.760
in foreign trade, in terms

05:21:52.770 --> 05:21:54.740
of the growth rate of foreign

05:21:54.750 --> 05:21:56.140
trade in the world.

05:22:03.980 --> 05:22:05.720
Variants of the floating exchange

05:22:05.730 --> 05:22:07.380
rate are the adjusted exchange

05:22:07.390 --> 05:22:08.620
rate.

05:22:08.640 --> 05:22:10.980
This is a currency exchange rate that

05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:12.540
automatically changes depending

05:22:12.550 --> 05:22:15.240
on the macroeconomic indicators

05:22:15.250 --> 05:22:16.060
listed in the legislation,

05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:17.640
such as the level of inflation

05:22:17.650 --> 05:22:19.900
or the country’s balance

05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:22.120
of payments.

05:22:23.240 --> 05:22:25.040
The next direction is controlled

05:22:25.050 --> 05:22:26.620
floating and, accordingly,

05:22:26.630 --> 05:22:27.820
controlled floating

05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:29.760
exchange rate.

05:22:30.320 --> 05:22:33.060
How does the state manage

05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:34.900
this floating course?

05:22:34.920 --> 05:22:36.460
These are not automatic changes.

05:22:36.600 --> 05:22:37.660
That is, it is assumed that

05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:39.420
the Central Bank in this case

05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:41.940
decides to change the exchange

05:22:41.950 --> 05:22:43.900
rate by intervening in

05:22:43.910 --> 05:22:46.320
the currency market.

05:22:46.330 --> 05:22:49.180
That is, I repeat, the purchase of the sale

05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:53.040
of the same currency as a result of this

05:22:53.050 --> 05:22:55.060
purchase of the sale the exchange rate

05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:57.060
of the country must be somehow adjusted.

05:22:57.820 --> 05:22:59.920
And the last variant of the variation

05:22:59.930 --> 05:23:01.660
of the floating exchange rate is

05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:03.060
independent floating and

05:23:03.070 --> 05:23:04.420
not state interference.

05:23:05.160 --> 05:23:06.820
The question arises whether

05:23:06.830 --> 05:23:09.220
independent swimming is not

05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:11.820
such an ideal variant of a floating

05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:13.340
exchange rate as perfect competition,

05:23:13.350 --> 05:23:16.160
or a theoretical option.

05:23:16.380 --> 05:23:18.180
No, independently floating exchange

05:23:18.190 --> 05:23:20.100
rates in such a system periodically

05:23:20.110 --> 05:23:22.360
come when they have a crisis

05:23:22.370 --> 05:23:23.920
of the national financial

05:23:23.930 --> 05:23:25.020
system.

05:23:25.040 --> 05:23:27.460
And in order to know at what

05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:29.680
level the exchange rate will be

05:23:29.690 --> 05:23:31.520
more or less established,

05:23:31.530 --> 05:23:33.280
and then adjust it, it can be there

05:23:33.290 --> 05:23:35.260
to conduct a policy of supporting

05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:38.260
this exchange rate,

05:23:38.270 --> 05:23:39.840
the mechanism of non-intervention

05:23:39.850 --> 05:23:42.440
of the state and independent

05:23:42.450 --> 05:23:44.540
floating of the exchange

05:23:44.550 --> 05:23:46.520
rate is included.

05:23:46.580 --> 05:23:49.560
In particular, in the 70s, at the time

05:23:49.570 --> 05:23:51.540
of the financial and currency

05:23:52.140 --> 05:23:55.060
crisis, European countries for 1-2

05:23:55.070 --> 05:23:57.020
months completely released their exchange

05:23:57.030 --> 05:23:58.500
rates to somehow orient

05:23:58.510 --> 05:24:01.300
themselves in the currency space.

05:24:07.760 --> 05:24:09.220
What are the modern ways to

05:24:09.230 --> 05:24:10.980
fix the exchange rate?

05:24:13.540 --> 05:24:15.100
The most common fixation on one currency,

05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:18.160
but nevertheless many countries

05:24:18.170 --> 05:24:20.220
fix the exchange rate at the cost

05:24:20.230 --> 05:24:22.200
of a basket of currencies.

05:24:22.600 --> 05:24:24.140
For example, modern Belarus fixes its

05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:26.560
exchange rate to the basket of solid

05:24:26.570 --> 05:24:28.260
currencies, the dollar and the euro, but

05:24:28.270 --> 05:24:31.340
also to the currency of neighbouring countries,

05:24:31.350 --> 05:24:33.660
that is, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia,

05:24:33.780 --> 05:24:34.860
Ukraine.

05:24:35.080 --> 05:24:37.200
Since September 1, 2000, the Russian

05:24:37.210 --> 05:24:38.980
ruble has been included in

05:24:38.990 --> 05:24:41.340
the fixation basket by the Central

05:24:41.350 --> 05:24:43.000
Bank of Belarus.

05:24:44.730 --> 05:24:47.570
Traditionally, when fixing the

05:24:47.580 --> 05:24:51.450
value of currency, fixing the

05:24:51.460 --> 05:24:53.030
exchange rates of the value of the

05:24:53.040 --> 05:24:57.950
currency basket, the most stable

05:24:57.960 --> 05:25:00.090
partners in international

05:25:00.100 --> 05:25:03.950
trade and currency-financial

05:25:03.960 --> 05:25:06.230
relations are used.

05:25:06.240 --> 05:25:10.670
In history, when the European

05:25:10.680 --> 05:25:14.290
Union was not yet a single currency,

05:25:14.300 --> 05:25:16.870
many developing countries, former

05:25:16.880 --> 05:25:19.830
colonies of European countries,

05:25:19.840 --> 05:25:23.990
just fixed their exchange rates

05:25:24.000 --> 05:25:28.370
to the former metropolis,

05:25:28.380 --> 05:25:30.450
for example, to the French

05:25:30.460 --> 05:25:33.590
franc or to the German mark.

05:25:34.990 --> 05:25:37.410
This trend hasined to a certain

05:25:37.420 --> 05:25:39.550
extent for them, as they now

05:25:39.560 --> 05:25:41.350
fix their exchange rate

05:25:41.360 --> 05:25:43.170
to the euro.

05:25:45.840 --> 05:25:47.780
A soft form of fixing the exchange

05:25:47.790 --> 05:25:50.140
rate is the currency corridor.

05:25:50.560 --> 05:25:52.240
This is also a variant of regulated

05:25:52.250 --> 05:25:55.340
floating, but it is assumed that the

05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:57.460
state the central bank announces

05:25:57.470 --> 05:25:59.980
in advance, at what intervals,

05:25:59.990 --> 05:26:02.180
within what limits the exchange

05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:04.260
rate will fluctuate.

05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:06.900
A fixed exchange rate is also subject

05:26:06.910 --> 05:26:11.340
to the possibility of some deviation.

05:26:11.820 --> 05:26:12.140
Why is?

05:26:12.260 --> 05:26:14.120
Because there is a currency

05:26:14.130 --> 05:26:16.520
market with free supply

05:26:16.530 --> 05:26:18.280
and demand, and the influence

05:26:18.360 --> 05:26:20.120
of supply demand can cause the

05:26:20.130 --> 05:26:22.720
market exchange rate to deviate

05:26:22.730 --> 05:26:24.660
from a fixed exchange

05:26:24.670 --> 05:26:25.720
rate.

05:26:26.020 --> 05:26:27.860
And so as not to affect

05:26:27.870 --> 05:26:30.420
the stability of the national

05:26:30.430 --> 05:26:32.920
currency, central banks at a

05:26:32.930 --> 05:26:34.540
fixed exchange rate allow deviations

05:26:34.550 --> 05:26:36.980
within the range of

05:26:36.990 --> 05:26:39.400
1.5 to 2.5%.

05:26:39.410 --> 05:26:42.420
Once the fluctuations reach

05:26:42.430 --> 05:26:46.900
the upper or lower limit of 1.

05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:49.680
5% the central bank intervenes

05:26:49.690 --> 05:26:52.240
and adjusts the exchange

05:26:52.250 --> 05:26:53.260
rate.

05:26:53.380 --> 05:26:55.460
If the central bank has not had

05:26:56.910 --> 05:26:59.480
enough funds to connotate, then

05:26:59.490 --> 05:27:01.780
the exchange rate is devalued,

05:27:01.790 --> 05:27:03.420
that is, it decreases.

05:27:03.620 --> 05:27:06.180
Or, on the contrary, if the trend

05:27:06.190 --> 05:27:08.180
of the world market is that the currency

05:27:08.190 --> 05:27:09.880
should be stronger, there is

05:27:10.020 --> 05:27:12.380
a revolution, as it was again in

05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:14.820
the 20th century with the Japanese

05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:16.900
yen, when they were unable

05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:18.560
to support a lower exchange

05:27:18.570 --> 05:27:20.900
rate with their central bank

05:27:20.910 --> 05:27:21.800
resources.

05:27:23.020 --> 05:27:25.100
So back to the currency corridor.

05:27:25.320 --> 05:27:27.420
The regulated floating within the

05:27:27.430 --> 05:27:29.720
currency corridor already implies

05:27:29.730 --> 05:27:34.580
fluctuations of more than 2 -3%.

05:27:34.590 --> 05:27:39.800
In particular, in Russia, before 1998

05:27:39.810 --> 05:27:41.820
for a number of years there was

05:27:41.830 --> 05:27:43.900
a currency corridor, so the width

05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:47.560
of the currency corridor was 15%.

05:27:47.570 --> 05:27:50.960
In 96-97 just before the currency crisis,

05:27:50.970 --> 05:27:52.320
it was slightly reduced to 13%,

05:27:52.330 --> 05:27:56.880
but in general it was not able to

05:27:56.890 --> 05:27:59.620
finally hold the fluctuations

05:27:59.630 --> 05:28:01.220
of the exchange rate.

05:28:08.220 --> 05:28:12.240
If we talk about the currency corridor

05:28:12.260 --> 05:28:15.660
used in the 70s, there was a rather

05:28:15.670 --> 05:28:17.460
interesting situation when the

05:28:17.470 --> 05:28:19.520
currency corridor was called generally

05:28:19.530 --> 05:28:21.660
"the snake in the tunnel", because the

05:28:21.670 --> 05:28:23.420
upper and lower bar of this tunnel were

05:28:23.430 --> 05:28:25.600
determined by European countries

05:28:25.610 --> 05:28:28.940
by the sum of the upper bar,

05:28:28.950 --> 05:28:30.420
that is, in this case it is the

05:28:30.430 --> 05:28:31.820
cheapest exchange rate, by the

05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:33.840
sum of the weakest currencies,

05:28:33.850 --> 05:28:35.620
and the lower bar, that is,

05:28:35.630 --> 05:28:37.400
a strong exchange rate when the

05:28:37.410 --> 05:28:39.060
currency and national rate

05:28:39.070 --> 05:28:40.580
fluctuate, by the group

05:28:40.590 --> 05:28:43.260
of the strongest currencies

05:28:43.270 --> 05:28:45.480
of the European Union.

05:28:46.380 --> 05:28:48.380
Again, this version of the currency corridor

05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:50.580
was able for the European Union to

05:28:50.590 --> 05:28:52.760
hold only a few months in that period

05:28:52.770 --> 05:28:54.520
of time, and accordingly the

05:28:54.530 --> 05:28:57.580
European Union monetary system came

05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:59.840
to the conclusion that it was necessary

05:28:59.850 --> 05:29:01.900
to simply release currency

05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:03.440
rates and maintain them at

05:29:03.450 --> 05:29:06.620
the expense of the intervention

05:29:06.630 --> 05:29:08.800
of the Central Bank without the

05:29:08.810 --> 05:29:11.140
announcement of the currency corridor.

05:29:13.320 --> 05:29:18.020
What is the current situation in the

05:29:18.030 --> 05:29:19.400
Russian currency system?

05:29:19.780 --> 05:29:23.600
In Russia, there is a floating

05:29:23.610 --> 05:29:25.980
exchange rate, but it is again

05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:27.320
regulated swimming.

05:29:27.900 --> 05:29:29.360
The currency corridor has already

05:29:29.580 --> 05:29:31.280
been canceled as the Russian ruble has

05:29:31.290 --> 05:29:33.680
become more stable and is subject to

05:29:33.690 --> 05:29:35.220
less fluctuations.

05:29:35.560 --> 05:29:37.560
The second reason for stabilization

05:29:37.570 --> 05:29:41.000
is the huge influx of oil dollars or

05:29:41.010 --> 05:29:48.420
euro oil currencies, which

05:29:48.430 --> 05:29:50.540
flows into the Russian financial territory

05:29:50.550 --> 05:29:52.980
in connection with the price

05:29:52.990 --> 05:29:54.920
of oil and energy growers.

05:29:56.700 --> 05:29:59.160
When the current exchange rate of

05:29:59.170 --> 05:30:03.280
the Russian ruble is determined in modern

05:30:03.290 --> 05:30:06.940
conditions, they do not use the quadrosystem,

05:30:06.950 --> 05:30:09.600
that is, the system I have

05:30:09.610 --> 05:30:10.960
already mentioned, when we

05:30:10.970 --> 05:30:12.440
have euro, dollars, yen, and pounds

05:30:12.450 --> 05:30:15.400
of sterling in our currency reserves,

05:30:15.680 --> 05:30:19.460
they use for current calculations

05:30:19.470 --> 05:30:21.180
a binary currency basket,

05:30:21.190 --> 05:30:23.320
that is, euros and dollars.

05:30:23.420 --> 05:30:27.520
60% of the calculations are in dollars,

05:30:27.530 --> 05:30:28.720
and accordingly, fluctuations

05:30:28.730 --> 05:30:30.300
in the US dollar rate are taken

05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:31.020
into account.

05:30:31.420 --> 05:30:34.640
40% of such a binary currency basket takes into

05:30:34.650 --> 05:30:38.100
account the fluctuation of the euro.

05:30:39.040 --> 05:30:42.080
If you look closely at the chart on the

05:30:42.090 --> 05:30:45.780
slide, then it is at the moment when the

05:30:45.790 --> 05:30:48.180
fluctuations in the ruble rate are

05:30:48.190 --> 05:30:50.640
most significant, let’s assume that

05:30:50.650 --> 05:30:54.140
this was February 2006, and as you

05:30:54.150 --> 05:30:58.420
can see, the price of the binary

05:30:58.430 --> 05:31:05.400
currency basket has gone up sharply,

05:31:05.410 --> 05:31:08.400
that is, the ruble has strengthened

05:31:08.410 --> 05:31:10.880
quite strongly, which in general,

05:31:10.890 --> 05:31:12.640
as I will tell later, is not beneficial

05:31:12.940 --> 05:31:14.800
for foreign trade.

05:31:14.860 --> 05:31:16.540
At this point of time, the peak

05:31:16.550 --> 05:31:18.540
of the Central Bank’s currency intervention

05:31:18.550 --> 05:31:20.800
just comes, that is, the Central

05:31:20.810 --> 05:31:23.900
Bank is trying to change the situation

05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:26.460
on the exchange rate, and the

05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:28.440
process is further stabilized during

05:31:28.450 --> 05:31:31.620
the first quarter of 2006.

05:31:31.840 --> 05:31:34.260
This is precisely due to the fact that

05:31:34.270 --> 05:31:36.880
at this point of time, depending on the

05:31:38.570 --> 05:31:41.740
financial situation, firms throw out

05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:43.200
currency in the form of payments to the

05:31:43.210 --> 05:31:43.820
market.

05:31:44.140 --> 05:31:45.780
And this is the situation that is taking place.

05:31:45.920 --> 05:31:47.780
The intervention of the central bank

05:31:47.790 --> 05:31:49.280
is slowly diminishing.

05:31:49.460 --> 05:31:51.860
And by October 2006, it was even stated

05:31:51.870 --> 05:31:53.520
that the Central Bank would temporarily

05:31:53.530 --> 05:31:55.020
not intervene in interfering

05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:56.240
with the exchange rate.

05:31:56.280 --> 05:31:57.640
But, I will repeat again,

05:31:57.650 --> 05:32:00.060
high exchange rates are not beneficial

05:32:00.070 --> 05:32:01.600
for exports.

05:32:01.820 --> 05:32:03.420
Based on this, the Central Bank in the

05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:04.860
current conditions will still interfere

05:32:04.870 --> 05:32:07.920
in the fluctuation of the currency

05:32:07.930 --> 05:32:09.640
rate of the ruble.

05:32:14.800 --> 05:32:17.220
The following scheme shows the dynamics

05:32:17.230 --> 05:32:18.620
of the official rates of the dollar

05:32:18.630 --> 05:32:20.820
and the euro to the ruble.

05:32:21.020 --> 05:32:24.040
Accordingly, as we can see, the US dollar,

05:32:24.050 --> 05:32:27.300
marked with a yellow line, fluctuates

05:32:27.310 --> 05:32:30.700
in the opposite direction

05:32:30.710 --> 05:32:33.660
in relation to the euro to

05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:34.920
the ruble.

05:32:34.960 --> 05:32:37.380
This is what we can imagine as

05:32:37.390 --> 05:32:39.800
the market rate of the ruble

05:32:39.810 --> 05:32:42.480
is set somewhere in the middle

05:32:42.490 --> 05:32:45.740
of this oscillation scale.

05:32:48.640 --> 05:32:51.100
Now let’s get a little distracted

05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:52.860
from the real reality of the

05:32:52.870 --> 05:32:55.580
Russian currency market and see

05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:57.300
how the exchange rate is

05:32:57.310 --> 05:32:59.380
determined.

05:32:59.390 --> 05:33:02.020
Based on this, we will understand what type

05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:03.480
of intervention the central bank

05:33:03.490 --> 05:33:05.060
should carry out.

05:33:05.070 --> 05:33:09.420
In principle, if the currency market

05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:13.360
is not operated by the state

05:33:13.370 --> 05:33:15.240
and there are no aggressive speculators,

05:33:15.250 --> 05:33:17.660
and they can be various financial

05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:19.740
structures, banks, financial

05:33:20.020 --> 05:33:21.500
institutions, funds, then

05:33:21.660 --> 05:33:26.800
depending on demand and offerings,

05:33:26.810 --> 05:33:28.400
a balance rate is

05:33:28.410 --> 05:33:30.120
established.

05:33:30.130 --> 05:33:33.180
Note that in the scheme we calculate

05:33:33.190 --> 05:33:36.080
the rate of the ruble there

05:33:36.090 --> 05:33:39.320
is actually the supply and demand

05:33:39.330 --> 05:33:40.640
for the dollar.

05:33:40.740 --> 05:33:43.440
That is, of course, the exchange rate is

05:33:43.450 --> 05:33:45.760
the price of the domestic currency,

05:33:45.880 --> 05:33:48.100
expressed in the value of foreign currency

05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:50.220
or in units of foreign currency.

05:33:50.320 --> 05:33:52.500
So, the supply of dollars in the Russian

05:33:52.510 --> 05:33:54.080
market is related to exports,

05:33:54.090 --> 05:33:56.420
the demand for dollars in the Russian

05:33:56.430 --> 05:33:58.580
market is related to imports.

05:34:01.040 --> 05:34:06.560
Of course, it is precisely the flow of currency

05:34:06.570 --> 05:34:08.000
to the domestic market and the pressure

05:34:08.010 --> 05:34:09.900
of demand in the domestic market

05:34:09.910 --> 05:34:13.620
that sets a certain rate of the ruble

05:34:13.630 --> 05:34:14.540
against the dollar.

05:34:14.550 --> 05:34:16.320
Suppose that 5 rubles per dollar,

05:34:16.420 --> 05:34:18.080
then we have the balance exchange

05:34:18.090 --> 05:34:20.560
rate set at point A.

05:34:22.860 --> 05:34:27.360
If the situation starts to change and,

05:34:27.370 --> 05:34:31.620
suppose, the rate of the ruble will

05:34:31.630 --> 05:34:35.640
fluctuate towards 7 rubles per dollar,

05:34:44.690 --> 05:34:47.700
then such a expensive dollar, in this

05:34:47.710 --> 05:34:52.160
case, it will turn into such a situation

05:34:52.170 --> 05:34:56.980
when dollars in the market will

05:34:56.990 --> 05:34:58.180
be a surplus.

05:34:58.760 --> 05:35:01.280
On the other hand, if the ruble rate

05:35:01.290 --> 05:35:05.540
drops to 4 rubles per dollar, then,

05:35:05.550 --> 05:35:08.460
respectively, the currency market will

05:35:08.470 --> 05:35:09.940
develop a dollar deficit.

05:35:09.950 --> 05:35:14.880
If now a country, the Central

05:35:14.890 --> 05:35:18.060
Bank, decides to intervene in the

05:35:18.070 --> 05:35:21.220
currency market to somehow support

05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:22.720
the exchange rate.

05:35:22.900 --> 05:35:25.000
If the state does not intervene,

05:35:25.700 --> 05:35:27.100
then the excess supply,

05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:28.980
say, of dollars at such a costly

05:35:28.990 --> 05:35:31.560
exchange rate, will eventually lead

05:35:31.570 --> 05:35:33.260
to the fall of demand for the

05:35:33.270 --> 05:35:36.880
expensive dollar and, again,

05:35:36.890 --> 05:35:39.720
the balance will return to

05:35:39.730 --> 05:35:45.660
5 rubles per dollar, as we do.

05:35:45.740 --> 05:35:50.280
If the situation is established

05:35:50.290 --> 05:35:52.960
4 rubles per dollar, then at such

05:35:52.970 --> 05:35:55.740
a low price, of course, a smaller

05:35:55.750 --> 05:35:57.720
number of counterparties will want to

05:35:57.730 --> 05:36:00.480
offer the dollar, but buy the dollar,

05:36:00.640 --> 05:36:02.160
again, want more agents, demand

05:36:02.170 --> 05:36:03.860
will be higher than supply, according

05:36:03.870 --> 05:36:06.180
to the law of demand and supply,

05:36:06.190 --> 05:36:08.020
again, the price per dollar will

05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:09.380
start to rise and set

05:36:09.390 --> 05:36:12.400
at the level of 5 rubles per

05:36:12.410 --> 05:36:13.000
dollar.

05:36:13.900 --> 05:36:16.920
Accordingly, what will

05:36:16.930 --> 05:36:20.320
the central bank do if it

05:36:20.330 --> 05:36:21.920
is trying to adjust

05:36:21.930 --> 05:36:23.880
the market exchange rate

05:36:23.890 --> 05:36:25.780
that has been established?

05:36:26.020 --> 05:36:29.060
If the Central Bank considers that the

05:36:29.070 --> 05:36:34.280
ruble rate is too high against the

05:36:34.290 --> 05:36:38.400
dollar, and such a expensive Russian

05:36:38.410 --> 05:36:40.600
currency does not meet the requirements

05:36:40.610 --> 05:36:43.160
of the exporters, then the Central

05:36:43.170 --> 05:36:45.240
Bank of Russia intervenes, throws

05:36:45.250 --> 05:36:48.360
the rubles onto the market and

05:36:48.370 --> 05:36:51.040
buys the dollars.

05:36:51.050 --> 05:36:54.980
The ruble price is beginning to decline.

05:36:55.500 --> 05:36:57.340
If the opposite situation

05:36:57.350 --> 05:37:01.400
is present, too cheap ruble, which

05:37:01.440 --> 05:37:03.200
can ultimately affect inflation

05:37:03.210 --> 05:37:04.740
in the long term, then the

05:37:04.750 --> 05:37:08.280
opposite situation is present.

05:37:08.290 --> 05:37:11.260
The central bank of Russia

05:37:14.040 --> 05:37:21.670
will sell dollars and buy rubles,

05:37:21.680 --> 05:37:23.650
thereby increasing the

05:37:23.660 --> 05:37:29.530
national rate of the ruble.

05:37:31.720 --> 05:37:33.920
What are the preferences of currency

05:37:33.930 --> 05:37:35.600
regimes depending on how developed

05:37:35.880 --> 05:37:37.760
the country is?

05:37:37.900 --> 05:37:40.040
If they are economically developed

05:37:40.050 --> 05:37:42.760
countries, they are not afraid

05:37:42.770 --> 05:37:44.560
of a floating exchange rate.

05:37:44.920 --> 05:37:46.360
Although perfect swimming,

05:37:46.370 --> 05:37:48.860
as I said, can be met quite

05:37:48.870 --> 05:37:50.180
rarely.

05:37:50.520 --> 05:37:52.020
And usually the system of perfect

05:37:52.030 --> 05:37:53.560
swimming only is enabled when

05:37:53.570 --> 05:37:54.980
financial instability.

05:37:55.840 --> 05:37:58.960
But the soft adjustment of the floating

05:37:58.970 --> 05:38:01.840
exchange rate is exactly the program

05:38:01.850 --> 05:38:03.600
that all developed countries

05:38:03.610 --> 05:38:05.660
in the world are now using.

05:38:07.760 --> 05:38:10.820
And through monetary

05:38:10.830 --> 05:38:16.980
policy, domestic macroeconomic

05:38:16.990 --> 05:38:18.280
stimulation of

05:38:18.290 --> 05:38:20.860
economic growth is mainly

05:38:20.870 --> 05:38:22.320
carried out.

05:38:23.260 --> 05:38:25.800
It is not by chance that the proposal,

05:38:26.380 --> 05:38:28.340
for example, for the reconstruction

05:38:28.350 --> 05:38:30.780
of the Russian economy, which originated

05:38:30.790 --> 05:38:34.160
from the United States at the

05:38:34.170 --> 05:38:36.160
end of the 20th century,

05:38:36.170 --> 05:38:39.400
was linked to the monetary policy.

05:38:39.410 --> 05:38:41.420
It is considered to be the most

05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:43.800
adequate for soft floating and

05:38:43.810 --> 05:38:45.560
floating exchange rates.

05:38:45.880 --> 05:38:47.720
Developing countries are opposite.

05:38:47.730 --> 05:38:49.520
They fear strong currency fluctuations

05:38:49.530 --> 05:38:51.620
and are ready to maintain

05:38:51.630 --> 05:38:53.280
a solid exchange rate, a fixed

05:38:53.290 --> 05:38:55.540
exchange rate, at any cost.

05:38:55.660 --> 05:38:56.720
And then the

05:38:56.730 --> 05:38:58.420
main domestic economic policy,

05:38:58.620 --> 05:39:00.400
which they can support, by

05:39:00.410 --> 05:39:02.340
the way, their exchange rate,

05:39:02.480 --> 05:39:04.060
and at least stabilize the

05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:05.800
internal economic system,

05:39:05.880 --> 05:39:07.220
and even promote economic

05:39:07.230 --> 05:39:08.960
growth, will be

05:39:08.970 --> 05:39:10.720
budget policy.

05:39:12.240 --> 05:39:14.780
Of course, transitional economies

05:39:14.790 --> 05:39:16.640
prefer not a hard fixed

05:39:16.650 --> 05:39:18.220
often exchange rate, but

05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:19.860
a currency corridor.

05:39:20.520 --> 05:39:23.840
But again, any exchange rate

05:39:23.850 --> 05:39:25.140
system that involves floating,

05:39:25.150 --> 05:39:27.820
it allows unfair players

05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:29.540
or currency speculators

05:39:29.550 --> 05:39:31.580
to enter the market.

05:39:31.680 --> 05:39:33.780
And if such an intervention

05:39:33.790 --> 05:39:35.740
is beneficial to some structures

05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:38.260
of the global community and they

05:39:38.270 --> 05:39:40.640
want to make a profit from currency

05:39:40.650 --> 05:39:42.600
speculation, then the floating

05:39:42.610 --> 05:39:44.300
exchange rate, like regulated

05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:46.920
floating, is more likely to

05:39:46.930 --> 05:39:48.920
be at risk than the fixed exchange

05:39:48.930 --> 05:39:49.960
rate.

05:39:52.320 --> 05:39:55.180
What are the benefits and losses of fixing

05:39:55.190 --> 05:39:58.060
the exchange rate of foreign currency

05:39:58.070 --> 05:40:01.500
and, accordingly, domestic currency?

05:40:02.360 --> 05:40:04.560
The advantage is, first of all,

05:40:04.570 --> 05:40:06.280
monetary discipline.

05:40:06.800 --> 05:40:08.800
When a fixed exchange rate is announced,

05:40:08.810 --> 05:40:10.840
a fairly strict program for

05:40:10.850 --> 05:40:13.860
calculations and stabilization

05:40:13.870 --> 05:40:18.060
of the money mass is carried out.

05:40:18.100 --> 05:40:20.760
They are practically trying not to

05:40:20.770 --> 05:40:22.940
include the cash machine in order

05:40:22.950 --> 05:40:24.280
to solve problems, such as the

05:40:24.400 --> 05:40:25.520
budget deficit.

05:40:26.960 --> 05:40:28.960
The second benefit is stability,

05:40:29.100 --> 05:40:31.160
independence, as I said, from currency

05:40:31.240 --> 05:40:32.580
speculation.

05:40:32.760 --> 05:40:37.940
But until this is a speculative

05:40:37.950 --> 05:40:39.760
attack, there will suddenly

05:40:39.770 --> 05:40:44.040
be no such aggressive force that

05:40:44.050 --> 05:40:46.380
is conducting this speculative

05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:47.280
attack, any transnational

05:40:47.290 --> 05:40:50.020
banks often have more reserves

05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:52.720
than the reserves of the

05:40:52.730 --> 05:40:54.120
national economy.

05:40:54.560 --> 05:40:56.420
I will repeat, this is the same example

05:40:56.740 --> 05:40:58.560
that happened to Japan in the second

05:40:58.570 --> 05:41:00.300
half of the 20th century.

05:41:01.820 --> 05:41:03.960
What are the cut-off sides of

05:41:03.970 --> 05:41:06.780
fixing the exchange rate to

05:41:06.790 --> 05:41:08.020
foreign currency?

05:41:08.500 --> 05:41:10.360
First, it is the loss of the ability

05:41:10.370 --> 05:41:11.500
to conduct an independent

05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:13.360
monetary policy.

05:41:14.320 --> 05:41:17.240
Because we always have to

05:41:17.250 --> 05:41:19.920
adjust our exchange rate to the

05:41:19.930 --> 05:41:21.620
monetary policy that is

05:41:21.630 --> 05:41:23.800
carried out by the financial

05:41:23.810 --> 05:41:27.960
authorities of the country to

05:41:27.970 --> 05:41:29.820
whose currency we fix our exchange

05:41:29.830 --> 05:41:31.040
rate.

05:41:31.560 --> 05:41:33.580
The second disadvantage is the import of

05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:34.540
foreign problems.

05:41:35.200 --> 05:41:38.020
Of course, if the exchange rate

05:41:38.030 --> 05:41:40.300
of the country, which we tried to rely

05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:42.140
on in its fixation, which was

05:41:42.300 --> 05:41:44.220
included in its currency perithet,

05:41:44.230 --> 05:41:47.840
begins to fall, then problems

05:41:47.850 --> 05:41:49.140
are created for the domestic

05:41:49.150 --> 05:41:51.160
currency, it begins to be expensive.

05:41:51.170 --> 05:41:52.760
For some countries, of course, this

05:41:53.460 --> 05:41:55.300
is good, but for some countries it

05:41:55.310 --> 05:41:56.900
is a negative export factor.

05:41:57.760 --> 05:41:59.620
On the other hand, if foreign currency

05:41:59.630 --> 05:42:01.460
starts to be more expensive and our

05:42:01.470 --> 05:42:04.300
currency is cheaper, then the joy

05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:07.140
of exporters does not always turn to

05:42:07.150 --> 05:42:08.800
the joy of the entire economy of

05:42:08.810 --> 05:42:11.280
the country, since the depreciation

05:42:11.290 --> 05:42:13.180
of a strong national currency can

05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:14.940
lead to financial instability

05:42:14.950 --> 05:42:17.180
and to inflation expectations and

05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:18.460
inflation as such.

05:42:18.470 --> 05:42:23.200
And the last disadvantage, I will

05:42:23.210 --> 05:42:24.540
repeat again, is the possibility

05:42:24.550 --> 05:42:25.860
of a collective attack

05:42:25.870 --> 05:42:28.140
on a fixed exchange rate, as

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:31.580
such a significant terrible

05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:33.620
danger that is exposed to

05:42:33.630 --> 05:42:35.540
a fixed exchange rate.

05:42:38.820 --> 05:42:41.160
The next question I would like to address

05:42:41.170 --> 05:42:43.500
is such an important, urgent

05:42:43.620 --> 05:42:44.640
question.

05:42:45.540 --> 05:42:47.340
I have said that, by parity

05:42:47.350 --> 05:42:48.880
of purchasing power, our

05:42:48.890 --> 05:42:51.080
ruble should cost 15 rubles

05:42:51.090 --> 05:42:53.180
per dollar.

05:42:53.280 --> 05:42:54.740
From the point of view of the

05:42:54.750 --> 05:42:57.120
national consumer, I can

05:42:57.130 --> 05:42:58.540
only rejoice at this exchange

05:42:58.550 --> 05:43:00.740
rate and say, wow, my salary and

05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:03.100
income level has risen dramatically.

05:43:03.700 --> 05:43:06.220
The Central Bank of Russia has reduced

05:43:06.230 --> 05:43:08.860
the exchange rate of the ruble.

05:43:09.880 --> 05:43:11.360
What is the situation here?

05:43:11.460 --> 05:43:13.940
Why is this situation unfavorable?

05:43:14.820 --> 05:43:16.520
Why are Italy and Portugal, which

05:43:16.540 --> 05:43:18.700
joined the European Union, more

05:43:19.380 --> 05:43:21.680
rigid currencies than the

05:43:21.690 --> 05:43:23.940
Italian and Portuguese national

05:43:23.950 --> 05:43:25.520
currencies that existed before

05:43:25.530 --> 05:43:27.380
the euro was introduced?

05:43:27.720 --> 05:43:29.760
Why they suddenly became

05:43:29.770 --> 05:43:32.120
dissatisfied with the situation

05:43:32.130 --> 05:43:34.420
of the euro financial system and

05:43:34.430 --> 05:43:36.780
recently talk, well, maybe, so to

05:43:36.790 --> 05:43:40.000
speak, without including any mechanism,

05:43:40.010 --> 05:43:41.300
maybe, it is just, so to speak,

05:43:41.310 --> 05:43:42.300
conversation and dissatisfaction,

05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:44.160
talking about leaving the

05:43:44.220 --> 05:43:45.840
euro system at all, precisely

05:43:45.850 --> 05:43:48.080
because they have

05:43:48.090 --> 05:43:50.200
macroeconomic problems.

05:43:51.360 --> 05:43:53.440
The influence of the exchange

05:43:53.450 --> 05:43:55.840
rate on foreign trade

05:43:55.850 --> 05:43:57.220
is significant.

05:43:57.800 --> 05:44:00.660
First, if a country’s exchange

05:44:00.670 --> 05:44:02.560
rate becomes relatively lower,

05:44:02.570 --> 05:44:04.860
it can use currency dumping as a

05:44:04.870 --> 05:44:08.240
form of penetration into

05:44:08.250 --> 05:44:09.680
international markets and seizure

05:44:09.690 --> 05:44:12.160
of international markets.

05:44:12.200 --> 05:44:14.280
To explain the currency dumping

05:44:14.290 --> 05:44:17.040
scheme, we will go to the

05:44:17.050 --> 05:44:17.960
next slide.

05:44:18.000 --> 05:44:20.580
Now, pay attention to the options

05:44:20.590 --> 05:44:23.480
for the influence of the

05:44:23.490 --> 05:44:26.240
exchange rate on foreign trade.

05:44:26.300 --> 05:44:28.600
This is hidden protectionism.

05:44:28.740 --> 05:44:30.620
In this case, it is assumed that

05:44:30.960 --> 05:44:32.820
if we have a weak exchange rate,

05:44:32.830 --> 05:44:35.020
then, in general, the national consumer

05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:37.020
will not be able to buy a lot

05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:39.180
of foreign imports for their

05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:40.780
cheap money.

05:44:40.790 --> 05:44:43.320
As soon as the national

05:44:43.330 --> 05:44:45.340
exchange rate, forgive me,

05:44:45.360 --> 05:44:46.560
the national currency rate

05:44:46.570 --> 05:44:48.820
is increased, our domestic

05:44:48.830 --> 05:44:50.540
consumer can immediately buy

05:44:50.550 --> 05:44:52.180
more components, machinery,

05:44:52.300 --> 05:44:54.440
equipment and final consumption

05:44:54.450 --> 05:44:58.140
goods for a more weighty

05:44:58.150 --> 05:45:01.100
ruble in its currency

05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:02.400
content.

05:45:03.600 --> 05:45:06.820
Therefore, this option of weakening

05:45:06.830 --> 05:45:08.760
the ruble is beneficial to the

05:45:08.770 --> 05:45:12.180
country if the country tries

05:45:12.190 --> 05:45:14.740
to implement additional hidden protectionism.

05:45:15.020 --> 05:45:19.620
This was the case in the Russian

05:45:19.630 --> 05:45:21.600
market until 2003.

05:45:22.020 --> 05:45:23.920
The situation of the relatively

05:45:23.930 --> 05:45:27.000
weak currency rate of the ruble led to

05:45:27.010 --> 05:45:29.260
the fact that we did not have to raise

05:45:29.270 --> 05:45:31.440
our tariff barriers during this

05:45:31.450 --> 05:45:34.280
period of time, precisely because

05:45:34.290 --> 05:45:36.520
the weak ruble automatically

05:45:36.530 --> 05:45:38.380
for almost a decade of the

05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:40.760
end of the 20th century protected

05:45:40.770 --> 05:45:42.960
the national economy from

05:45:42.970 --> 05:45:46.360
the rapid growth of imports.

05:45:46.720 --> 05:45:49.000
But since 2003, this situation

05:45:49.010 --> 05:45:52.220
has changed, so the currency reserve

05:45:52.230 --> 05:45:56.480
that our national economy received

05:45:56.490 --> 05:45:59.000
in the form of protectionism

05:45:59.010 --> 05:46:03.000
of the weak ruble has ended.

05:46:03.010 --> 05:46:05.280
And at present, this mechanism is no

05:46:05.290 --> 05:46:06.860
longer working, because the currency

05:46:06.870 --> 05:46:09.920
of the ruble has stabilized and

05:46:09.930 --> 05:46:11.780
slowly increased in the

05:46:11.790 --> 05:46:13.420
last three years.

05:46:14.080 --> 05:46:17.840
And the last unpleasant variant of

05:46:17.850 --> 05:46:20.060
the influence of the exchange rate

05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:21.840
is the Dutch disease.

05:46:26.780 --> 05:46:28.040
The Dutch disease.

05:46:28.220 --> 05:46:31.480
What is such a terrible situation?

05:46:31.600 --> 05:46:33.300
What is the financial system of the country

05:46:33.310 --> 05:46:35.280
hurt if the situation of Dutch disease

05:46:35.290 --> 05:46:36.380
is included?

05:46:37.820 --> 05:46:40.440
This situation is called,

05:46:40.450 --> 05:46:42.340
as you can see, the situation

05:46:42.350 --> 05:46:45.900
in the Dutch economy.

05:46:46.220 --> 05:46:48.500
When after the crisis of the 70s, which

05:46:48.960 --> 05:46:50.900
was not only currency, financial,

05:46:51.020 --> 05:46:53.880
but also was associated with a sharp

05:46:53.890 --> 05:46:55.740
price increase of oil, that is, it was

05:46:55.780 --> 05:46:57.200
still an energy crisis, the Netherlands

05:46:57.210 --> 05:47:01.860
decided to open the domestic reserves

05:47:01.870 --> 05:47:03.560
of the country.

05:47:03.740 --> 05:47:05.980
In this country began to develop

05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:08.060
a fuel-energy complex, which,

05:47:08.340 --> 05:47:10.520
so to speak, was previously in

05:47:10.530 --> 05:47:11.700
a stunned state.

05:47:11.820 --> 05:47:14.340
And the money just went

05:47:14.350 --> 05:47:16.580
to this fuel-

05:47:16.590 --> 05:47:17.720
energy complex.

05:47:17.800 --> 05:47:18.860
Where did they come from?

05:47:18.960 --> 05:47:21.060
They came from other sectors

05:47:21.070 --> 05:47:22.260
of the economy.

05:47:22.880 --> 05:47:24.940
And in this regard, the countries, forgive

05:47:24.950 --> 05:47:28.340
me, were affected by industries that

05:47:28.350 --> 05:47:30.180
worked for domestic demand, not for

05:47:30.190 --> 05:47:30.820
exports.

05:47:30.830 --> 05:47:33.760
Other non-energy industries

05:47:33.770 --> 05:47:35.860
were also affected.

05:47:35.980 --> 05:47:37.940
The energy complex developed

05:47:37.950 --> 05:47:39.600
at a rapid pace.

05:47:41.500 --> 05:47:47.820
And just the rise in energy

05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:50.940
prices has led to a huge flow

05:47:50.950 --> 05:47:54.120
of foreign currency to the territory

05:47:54.130 --> 05:47:57.180
of the Netherlands.

05:47:58.500 --> 05:48:00.180
The Dutch Gulden began to grow

05:48:00.190 --> 05:48:03.420
during that time.

05:48:03.680 --> 05:48:06.740
Thus, the export prices for

05:48:06.750 --> 05:48:08.660
Dutch products not oil,

05:48:08.670 --> 05:48:10.340
not gas, not energy

05:48:10.350 --> 05:48:13.720
products there began to rise.

05:48:14.340 --> 05:48:16.480
But the demand for these goods in the world

05:48:16.490 --> 05:48:17.480
is not so elastic.

05:48:17.580 --> 05:48:19.940
That is, there is no such reaction

05:48:20.420 --> 05:48:22.300
that, sorry, it is not elastic.

05:48:22.380 --> 05:48:23.840
That is, there is no such reaction

05:48:23.850 --> 05:48:25.820
that if oil prices have risen, they

05:48:25.830 --> 05:48:27.400
are still being bought.

05:48:27.800 --> 05:48:31.240
But the demand for goods that,

05:48:31.250 --> 05:48:33.540
in addition to energy

05:48:33.550 --> 05:48:36.060
exports, the Netherlands was

05:48:36.070 --> 05:48:38.800
simply in a crisis.

05:48:38.980 --> 05:48:43.100
That is, at such high prices these

05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:45.380
goods were not bought.

05:48:45.540 --> 05:48:47.320
The Dutch disease has thus hit

05:48:47.330 --> 05:48:50.100
the structure of the economy twice.

05:48:50.500 --> 05:48:53.300
The first strike is the withdrawal of resources

05:48:53.310 --> 05:48:55.180
from other industries in favor

05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:57.020
of the export-oriented sector.

05:48:57.340 --> 05:48:58.320
Well, within the most

05:48:58.330 --> 05:49:00.500
export-oriented sector as a result of

05:49:00.510 --> 05:49:02.820
the national currency rate,

05:49:02.830 --> 05:49:04.600
the growth of the national currency

05:49:04.610 --> 05:49:09.140
rate, the transfer of profits to

05:49:09.150 --> 05:49:15.020
the energy sector and in this case

05:49:15.030 --> 05:49:17.900
the loss of the rest of the export

05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:19.700
industries.

05:49:22.040 --> 05:49:25.060
In addition to the problems with the

05:49:25.070 --> 05:49:28.060
sectoral proportions in the country, there

05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:32.760
are also problems of the currency and financial

05:49:32.770 --> 05:49:35.140
component of the macroeconomy.

05:49:37.460 --> 05:49:40.780
Now, with regard to the change

05:49:40.790 --> 05:49:45.260
of the simplest scheme, changes

05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:49.020
in the exchange rate under the influence

05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:54.220
of changes in the influx of foreign

05:49:54.230 --> 05:49:57.900
currency into the country, as in

05:49:57.910 --> 05:49:59.840
some way not rising, let

05:49:59.850 --> 05:50:02.980
us suppose, Russian prices suddenly

05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:05.480
in dollar terms are becoming higher.

05:50:06.100 --> 05:50:07.760
Let’s look at the diagram.

05:50:07.920 --> 05:50:09.960
The scheme presents the price per kilogram

05:50:09.970 --> 05:50:12.500
of carrots at the rate of 25 rubles

05:50:12.510 --> 05:50:13.380
per dollar.

05:50:13.640 --> 05:50:17.220
In rubles, the price is 25 rubles.

05:50:17.520 --> 05:50:19.980
If someone abroad decides

05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:22.480
to buy this very carrots,

05:50:22.490 --> 05:50:23.780
he will pay $1.

05:50:24.360 --> 05:50:26.020
Now we can imagine that the course of

05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:28.220
the ruble has become stronger.

05:50:31.950 --> 05:50:33.470
Sorry, but weakest

05:50:36.070 --> 05:50:40.870
And now for a dollar, when exchanging,

05:50:40.880 --> 05:50:42.670
you can earn 30 rubles.

05:50:42.970 --> 05:50:44.730
The price of the carrot has not changed.

05:50:44.740 --> 05:50:46.550
And now for the kilogram of

05:50:46.560 --> 05:50:49.910
carrots, the foreign importer

05:50:49.920 --> 05:50:54.530
will pay only 84 cents.

05:50:54.630 --> 05:50:56.670
That is, it turns out that with

05:50:56.680 --> 05:50:58.650
relatively stable world prices

05:50:58.660 --> 05:51:00.810
and domestic prices for this product,

05:51:00.820 --> 05:51:03.870
the relative price in the

05:51:03.880 --> 05:51:05.810
dollar or foreign currency

05:51:05.820 --> 05:51:07.870
has decreased.

05:51:08.130 --> 05:51:11.170
This way, exports will be

05:51:11.180 --> 05:51:12.530
better purchased.

05:51:20.400 --> 05:51:24.020
What else is the situation here related

05:51:24.030 --> 05:51:26.020
to the gain from the decline of the

05:51:26.030 --> 05:51:28.180
exchange rate, in addition to such

05:51:28.190 --> 05:51:29.960
a net decline in prices, which

05:51:29.970 --> 05:51:33.320
is related, in particular, to the Russian

05:51:33.580 --> 05:51:35.680
situation, which is prone, in

05:51:35.690 --> 05:51:38.240
this case, as a harmless Dutch disease.

05:51:38.840 --> 05:51:40.660
So the situation is related to this.

05:51:41.060 --> 05:51:42.840
So, our exporters are oil

05:51:42.850 --> 05:51:45.700
and gas, and we export mostly raw

05:51:45.710 --> 05:51:47.840
materials, unfortunately, at the moment,

05:51:47.850 --> 05:51:52.120
they are just at the falling rate

05:51:52.130 --> 05:51:56.180
of the ruble, having received

05:51:56.190 --> 05:51:58.260
currency revenues, for example,

05:51:58.270 --> 05:52:00.660
in dollars or euros, get

05:52:00.670 --> 05:52:05.820
much more rubles in the ruble ratio.

05:52:06.180 --> 05:52:08.840
And, accordingly, they are thus

05:52:09.440 --> 05:52:11.760
earning a profit on the difference

05:52:11.770 --> 05:52:14.140
in exchange rates.

05:52:17.660 --> 05:52:19.980
There is a strong influence

05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:23.680
group in Russia on the

05:52:23.690 --> 05:52:25.400
decline of the exchange

05:52:25.410 --> 05:52:26.320
rate.

05:52:26.340 --> 05:52:28.080
First of all, they are exporters.

05:52:28.160 --> 05:52:31.040
But we must not forget that importers

05:52:31.050 --> 05:52:33.280
are interested in raising

05:52:33.290 --> 05:52:34.840
the exchange rate.

05:52:34.900 --> 05:52:37.380
Importers are not only end-

05:52:37.390 --> 05:52:39.000
use goods, clothing, food,

05:52:39.100 --> 05:52:40.880
but also importers who supply

05:52:40.890 --> 05:52:43.460
components, machines, equipment

05:52:43.470 --> 05:52:46.080
and technologies to their

05:52:46.240 --> 05:52:47.780
factories.

05:52:47.800 --> 05:52:49.420
Naturally, the stronger the currency rate

05:52:49.430 --> 05:52:51.460
of the ruble, the more new technologies

05:52:51.470 --> 05:52:53.700
they will be able to buy in the West.

05:52:53.710 --> 05:52:55.500
The weaker the currency rate of

05:52:55.680 --> 05:52:58.120
the ruble, the less stable

05:52:58.130 --> 05:52:59.020
the situation and

05:52:59.030 --> 05:53:00.440
less favorable for importers.

05:53:00.520 --> 05:53:03.380
So, the struggle of two forces in

05:53:03.390 --> 05:53:04.760
any national economy.

05:53:04.820 --> 05:53:06.500
The interests of the exporters and the interests

05:53:06.510 --> 05:53:08.400
of the importers are in conflict.

05:53:08.720 --> 05:53:10.200
Depending on this, they influence

05:53:10.210 --> 05:53:12.040
the government.

05:53:12.460 --> 05:53:14.660
And the monetary policy is

05:53:14.670 --> 05:53:16.640
being developed, which is again

05:53:16.650 --> 05:53:18.520
a kind of compromise between interests

05:53:18.530 --> 05:53:20.500
within the national economy

05:53:20.510 --> 05:53:23.000
and within the national

05:53:23.010 --> 05:53:25.520
economy oriented to export.

05:53:27.490 --> 05:53:30.510
What are the main factors of the exchange rate?

05:53:30.530 --> 05:53:32.150
Let us summarize the results.

05:53:32.190 --> 05:53:33.970
First of all, the interest rate

05:53:33.980 --> 05:53:35.690
on loans.

05:53:37.200 --> 05:53:38.600
How can the interest rate

05:53:38.610 --> 05:53:40.380
of the loan affect the exchange

05:53:40.390 --> 05:53:41.220
rate?

05:53:42.040 --> 05:53:43.980
If we decide to make export

05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:46.540
or import payments, it

05:53:46.550 --> 05:53:49.520
is assumed that if we do not

05:53:49.530 --> 05:53:51.300
deliver immediately, but after

05:53:51.310 --> 05:53:53.380
a certain period of time,

05:53:53.390 --> 05:53:55.600
the exporter or importer

05:53:55.920 --> 05:53:59.460
risks that during this time

05:53:59.480 --> 05:54:01.920
his exchange rate will change

05:54:01.930 --> 05:54:03.720
greatly.

05:54:03.820 --> 05:54:05.300
Based on this, he has a choice,

05:54:05.310 --> 05:54:07.720
for example, to take and place the

05:54:07.730 --> 05:54:09.360
currency in which he is going to pay

05:54:09.370 --> 05:54:12.900
his contracts to the bank, to get

05:54:13.080 --> 05:54:15.300
interest, and that interest will

05:54:15.310 --> 05:54:17.900
cover currency risks.

05:54:18.140 --> 05:54:19.440
Therefore, the interest rate

05:54:19.450 --> 05:54:21.320
on loans abroad and in the

05:54:21.330 --> 05:54:23.440
national economy necessarily affects

05:54:23.450 --> 05:54:26.860
the exchange rate.

05:54:27.100 --> 05:54:29.380
Take the situation in the United States.

05:54:30.500 --> 05:54:32.880
Just a few in the last quarter,

05:54:32.890 --> 05:54:37.960
the level of the exchange rate in the

05:54:37.970 --> 05:54:40.400
United States rose due to the fact

05:54:40.410 --> 05:54:42.460
that the Central Bank in the United States,

05:54:42.470 --> 05:54:44.080
called the Federal Reserve System,

05:54:44.600 --> 05:54:47.260
raised the refinancing interest

05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:48.920
rate, that is, on loans

05:54:48.930 --> 05:54:52.340
and deposits of their Central Bank.

05:54:52.560 --> 05:54:54.420
The next factor that affects the exchange

05:54:54.430 --> 05:54:56.260
rate is the level of inflation.

05:54:56.740 --> 05:54:59.480
Inflation leads to devaluation of currency.

05:54:59.560 --> 05:55:02.060
And ultimately, when the money is

05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:03.680
too swollen compared to

05:55:03.690 --> 05:55:05.340
the commodity mass in the market,

05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:07.740
it is one of the causes

05:55:07.750 --> 05:55:09.880
of inflation, or too high

05:55:09.890 --> 05:55:12.900
costs, so commodity prices rise.

05:55:13.020 --> 05:55:16.620
Ultimately, the monetary inflation factor

05:55:16.630 --> 05:55:19.140
leads to the fact that the exchange

05:55:19.150 --> 05:55:21.040
rate begins to weaken and

05:55:21.050 --> 05:55:21.840
fall.

05:55:22.140 --> 05:55:23.960
The level of income, which

05:55:23.970 --> 05:55:25.560
is expressed in gross domestic product

05:55:25.570 --> 05:55:27.120
per capita or in general in gross

05:55:27.130 --> 05:55:28.340
domestic product, which is

05:55:28.350 --> 05:55:30.080
created in the country, how does

05:55:30.160 --> 05:55:32.420
it affect the exchange rate?

05:55:32.600 --> 05:55:35.760
It is good to have

05:55:35.770 --> 05:55:37.440
rich neighbors.

05:55:37.560 --> 05:55:37.860
Why is?

05:55:38.200 --> 05:55:40.780
Because they are willing to buy our

05:55:40.790 --> 05:55:43.140
exports at a higher price.

05:55:43.200 --> 05:55:44.620
Consequently, the level of income abroad

05:55:44.630 --> 05:55:47.680
is interesting for our exporters.

05:55:47.960 --> 05:55:49.460
If the income is growing,

05:55:49.470 --> 05:55:51.660
what is the situation?

05:55:52.040 --> 05:55:54.320
Our consumers are getting richer.

05:55:54.520 --> 05:55:55.920
But they are willing to buy not only

05:55:55.930 --> 05:55:57.500
domestic goods, they are willing to

05:55:57.510 --> 05:55:58.700
buy and import.

05:55:58.820 --> 05:56:01.400
Thus, they start buying

05:56:01.410 --> 05:56:03.300
on imports often more than

05:56:03.310 --> 05:56:06.520
it takes to balance

05:56:06.530 --> 05:56:08.460
the exchange rate.

05:56:08.680 --> 05:56:09.960
This is a negative

05:56:09.970 --> 05:56:11.800
factor on the exchange rate.

05:56:11.860 --> 05:56:12.960
The trade balance of payments

05:56:12.970 --> 05:56:14.320
is negative and the exchange

05:56:14.360 --> 05:56:17.080
rate is deteriorating.

05:56:17.680 --> 05:56:20.580
Now in Russia, the situation in

05:56:20.590 --> 05:56:24.440
which the stabilizing exchange rate of

05:56:24.450 --> 05:56:29.760
the ruble has forced imports to increase.

05:56:30.340 --> 05:56:32.480
But for now, the situation is not terrible.

05:56:32.490 --> 05:56:33.960
On the contrary, the increase in

05:56:33.970 --> 05:56:35.000
imports works as a correlation

05:56:35.010 --> 05:56:36.720
to the decline of the currency

05:56:36.730 --> 05:56:38.240
rate of the ruble.

05:56:38.700 --> 05:56:40.600
Foreign trade policy is also a factor

05:56:40.610 --> 05:56:42.660
of the exchange rate.

05:56:42.720 --> 05:56:45.140
Because, of course, if we have tariff

05:56:45.150 --> 05:56:46.940
and other foreign trade barriers,

05:56:46.950 --> 05:56:50.080
we will have a restriction on

05:56:50.090 --> 05:56:51.980
the flow of exports and imports.

05:56:52.020 --> 05:56:54.880
Therefore, the flow of payments will be limited.

05:56:55.280 --> 05:56:57.340
We will not receive export

05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:58.440
revenues.

05:56:58.640 --> 05:57:00.220
And once we do not get export revenues,

05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:02.140
the ratio, for example, euro-ruble

05:57:02.400 --> 05:57:08.240
or ruble-dollar, will change dramatically.

05:57:08.740 --> 05:57:10.340
Therefore, foreign trade policy

05:57:10.350 --> 05:57:12.600
for a good, floating, even

05:57:12.610 --> 05:57:14.360
adjustable exchange rate

05:57:14.640 --> 05:57:15.560
must be liberal.

05:57:16.840 --> 05:57:18.820
The next, last factor I’

05:57:19.040 --> 05:57:20.700
m bringing on our list is monetary

05:57:20.800 --> 05:57:23.460
credit and monetary policy.

05:57:24.740 --> 05:57:26.700
As I said before, the amount

05:57:26.710 --> 05:57:29.220
of money in the economy will

05:57:29.230 --> 05:57:31.780
ultimately affect inflation,

05:57:31.790 --> 05:57:33.760
but in the medium and

05:57:33.770 --> 05:57:35.500
long term it will affect

05:57:35.680 --> 05:57:37.140
the exchange rate.

05:57:37.340 --> 05:57:39.500
And if the government includes a printing

05:57:39.510 --> 05:57:42.880
machine in the framework of the credit

05:57:42.890 --> 05:57:44.560
and monetary policy to reduce

05:57:44.570 --> 05:57:46.340
the deficit of the state budget,

05:57:46.350 --> 05:57:48.000
then this is exactly the excess

05:57:48.010 --> 05:57:50.320
money, they are thrown into two markets,

05:57:50.330 --> 05:57:52.200
the securities market and

05:57:52.210 --> 05:57:54.340
the currency market.

05:57:54.400 --> 05:57:57.100
And while we assume that the supply

05:57:57.280 --> 05:57:58.680
of the ruble will be above the dollar

05:57:58.690 --> 05:58:00.900
or above the euro, the exchange rate

05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:02.580
of the ruble begins to fall.

05:58:02.740 --> 05:58:05.120
This is another component that

05:58:05.130 --> 05:58:10.540
affects the internal system as such.

05:58:10.760 --> 05:58:13.140
Of course, all these components

05:58:13.150 --> 05:58:16.040
that I listed, they can be

05:58:16.050 --> 05:58:18.420
considered in a foreign country.

05:58:18.430 --> 05:58:18.780
Why is?

05:58:18.860 --> 05:58:19.920
Because all these six components

05:58:19.930 --> 05:58:22.040
will affect the exchange rate

05:58:22.050 --> 05:58:23.680
against which we will learn

05:58:23.690 --> 05:58:25.680
the currency, the exchange

05:58:25.700 --> 05:58:27.000
rate of the domestic and national

05:58:27.010 --> 05:58:27.940
currency.

05:58:28.120 --> 05:58:29.700
If the U.S. monetary authorities

05:58:29.710 --> 05:58:32.440
conduct a policy of lowering or

05:58:32.450 --> 05:58:34.500
raising interest rates, this is

05:58:34.510 --> 05:58:37.120
simply an echo of all the currencies

05:58:37.130 --> 05:58:40.020
that determine their fluctuating

05:58:40.030 --> 05:58:42.080
exchange rate, including

05:58:42.090 --> 05:58:45.240
against the U.S. dollar.

05:58:47.300 --> 05:58:48.340
Thus, we have considered

05:58:48.350 --> 05:58:49.860
the main factors of the exchange

05:58:49.870 --> 05:58:51.920
rate and mainly in relation

05:58:51.930 --> 05:58:52.180
to the US dollar.
