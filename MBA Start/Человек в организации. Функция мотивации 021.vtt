00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Everything we have discussed before is directly related to motivation.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
What is motivation? Let's look at it again.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
In order to make all the tasks set before the organization or before a person

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
during the annual interview or in the planned trial period

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
were achieved, it is not enough to have only a set of qualified personnel.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Really? Why?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Because it is necessary to organize the work in such a way

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
that everyone puts the maximum effort to perform the tasks set.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
And this is already difficult.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
And this is really management.

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
And how to organize the work of people so that they put the maximum effort,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
not to sit at work from one call to another.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
This is already management art.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
By the way, in management courses,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
they read a lot of different subjects.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Marketing, economics, finance.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
All this is very important, all this is necessary.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Without it, it is impossible.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Maybe because I am a director of personnel,

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
so it seems to me that the most important aspect of management is human resources.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
But maybe not only because of this.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Everything that happens is done by human hands and brains.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
If we cannot manage people, we will not be able to manage the economy.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
People make it.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
We will not be able to manage marketing.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
What is marketing?

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
If you buy some product, this product should be delivered by a person.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
If you do not know how to manage these people, who will deliver the information?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Therefore, management of human resources,

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
motivation of these resources is the most important aspect of management.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Successful and unsuccessful managers are those who know how to manage the staff.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
So, let's move on to the motivation function.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
The eternal topic, the infinite.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
We start this infinite topic, the insanely interesting topic.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
What is it interesting about?

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
About the fact that any person wants to feel motivated when he goes to work.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
He wants to do what he likes.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
And to do so and to receive money for it,

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
so that he receives pleasure and satisfaction not only from work, but also from the reward.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
And the company is interesting because it wants to have motivated employees,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
who will work more and more effectively.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
How to achieve this?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Almost like a fairy tale, almost an unfulfilled dream.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
But in some companies it comes true, some companies strive for it.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
One of the problems in today's market,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
which organizations face in the field of stimulating employees,

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
is that two generally known principles are used.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Increase in salary or fired.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
If you don't like it, you can quit.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
We pay like this.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Someone works well, he was paid more.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
That's it.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
There are no other stimuli.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
In principle, you can say, well, what is right?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
A person works for money.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
For the idea, of course, we are interested in a lot of different components when we get to work,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
which we will talk about a little later.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
But salary is an important factor.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Although, as many studies show,

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
salary is not the main criterion of evaluation when a person changes his job.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Look how interesting.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Often we choose a job because we leave one and go to another, where they pay more.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
On the other hand, when we leave a job,

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
the argument that I am leaving where I am paid more is not always the main one.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Even today in large Western companies,

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
managers are best known for some motivation theories.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
Because motivation is a serious, important argument in any company.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
And, of course, to know about various theories, approaches, trends,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
what were, what are now,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
and, in principle, you can even read what will be fashionable and what will be accepted on the market after a while.

04:50.000 --> 05:00.000
Any manager or person who considers his career growth as managerial,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
that is, a soldier who does not want to be a general,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
so any general should know the basics of managing and managing people.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And the most important component is motivation.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
Naturally, high efficiency and adequate stimulation of employees is an important function of management.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And it absolutely cannot be ignored.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
It cannot be made very simple and it cannot be complicated,

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
but it is necessary to have an idea of ​​art of motivation.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And now let's talk about this art.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Question. Why do you work?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Is the question asked correctly?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Or better to ask why do you work in this position?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
From your point of view, which question is more correct?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
If we can answer the first question right away, why do you work?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
The answer is, I work for money.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Then the second question, I work for money in this position,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
is unlikely to be answered by a person right away,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
because he will think about it, why I really work in this position.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Think about it, why do you work in the position you are in now?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Why?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, money is clear, not free.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And why else?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Let's try to answer these questions.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
What motivates you to work in this or that position?

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
Behavior at work can be controlled by external and internal factors.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
The external factor is the stimulus-reaction,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
the internal factor is the behavior of a person at work,

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
and it is controlled by the influence on the inner world of a person, on his needs.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
That is, I work in this position because my needs are being fulfilled,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
I achieve something, I get satisfaction.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
That is, a certain motivation.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Speaking of motivation and the theory of motivation,

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
let's start with the last century.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Capitalism was developing, it was 200 years old,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
100 years have passed, it was developing,

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
and people began to think about why some companies are more successful,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
others are less successful.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
What makes people work more effectively,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
and how many wolves do not feed, but look into the forest.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
How to influence people to work?

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
Naturally, people began to be interested in these issues.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
The very first thing that comes to mind is psychology.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
At the turn of the centuries,

07:54.000 --> 08:02.000
such an interesting science as psychoanalysis appeared.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Psychoanalysis was created at the end of the last century

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
by the Austrian scientist Sigmund Freud.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I think almost everyone knows Freud.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
The personality is odious, the theory is known,

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
although probably more known as the theory of sleep, the theory of sex.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
And few people now even associate it with the theory of psychoanalysis

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
from the point of view of even some motivational things.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Psychoanalysis also arose not from nothing.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
The basis for this is psychology,

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
where psycho is the soul, and logos, as we know, is science.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
This is a science about the patterns of the development and functioning of the psyche.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
Do not confuse it with psychiatry, which deals with the violation of the functioning of the psyche.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
By the way, there are really confused people here.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And psychoanalysis is also not psychiatry.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Freud's successors are the famous Jung,

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
as well as Alfred Alder, and some others.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
In fact, it is probably better to be a successor than to create a direction.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Because, as a rule, the successor always argues with the founder's father.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Therefore, all his successors argued with Freud.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
And the successors, based on his psychoanalysis, created their own theories, their own approaches,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
argued with Freud's postulates.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
But it is Freud who is the father of psychoanalysis.

09:44.000 --> 09:53.000
And, in fact, the theory of human behavior is the first and one of the most influential theories of personality in psychology.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
The theory of personality.

09:55.000 --> 10:06.000
And usually it refers to the classical psychoanalysis created by Sigmund Freud.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
By the way, many people forget about this.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
That it was really a theory of personality in psychology, and this is a classical psychoanalysis.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
The structure of the human psyche is distinguished by two spheres, the conscious and the unconscious.

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
The unconscious is the biological nature of a person and is governed by instincts.

10:30.000 --> 10:40.000
The instinct of self-preservation, for example, which regulates the sensory sphere of natural needs.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
I want to eat, I will go and eat.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Here the fire is dangerous, I will not go there.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
The instinct of self-preservation.

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
And the conscious, which controls the unconscious and determines behavior in the public sphere, in the public environment.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
There is a conflict between the conscious and the unconscious.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Then the balance between the two spheres of the psyche collapses.

11:08.000 --> 11:18.000
Here psychoanalysis helps to understand the problem of this conflict.

11:19.000 --> 11:29.000
The psyche is automatically regulated by the principle of satisfaction, which is modified in the principle of reality.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
And with various violations, a reset is carried out through the unconscious sphere.

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
When some negative information accumulates and I cannot perceive it, I just reset it and do not refuse it.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
It is not there.

11:47.000 --> 11:58.000
Later Freud worked on his views.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
He conducted a lot of experiments.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I will not talk about it now.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
But his ego and super ego are really very well known.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
The self and the super self.

12:10.000 --> 12:19.000
The self is a part of a person's personality, which is in contact with the outside world.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
The self and the super self are very interesting qualities.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
This is what a person should do in society.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
This is morality, this is honor, this is shame.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
This is super ego.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Freud distributed such interesting things at different levels.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
That is, I am the world and my morality, shame, honor, conscience.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Probably, conscience will be the key word in the super ego.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
The super ego is my conscience.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Through this prism, I look at the world around me.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
In this case, why do we stop at Freud?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Because he is the father of psychoanalysis.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Many theories of motivation will use him as a basis.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
Naturally, after rethinking, changing, improving, maybe even before recognition.

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
But he is the first brick on which a huge building called the theory of motivation is built.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
At the same time, they lived at the same time.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, Edith von Freud.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
One in Russia, the other in Europe.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov developed...

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
In general, he is a famous physiologist.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
By the way, he became the first Russian Nobel laureate in 1903.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
He studied the science of higher neural activity.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
I think the first thing that comes to mind when any of us hears the surname Pavlov,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
is the experience with dogs, is the conditional and unconditional reflexes.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Again, conscious, unconscious, conditional, unconditional.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Everything is very interconnected.

14:17.000 --> 14:25.000
As at the beginning of the last century, science developed in different countries in approximately the same direction.

14:25.000 --> 14:33.000
Pavlov, the creation of the theory of conditional and unconditional reflexes,

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
was another brick on which the Americans built their theories.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
And they called themselves...

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
Of course, not them, later they were defined as behaviorists.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
From the English word behave.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
That is, those who studied behavior, conditional and unconditional behavior reflexes.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
So, behaviorism, behavior is one of the directions in psychology.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
If Freud is psychoanalysis, Pavlov is physiology, then it is psychology.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Psycho-soul, logos-science of the soul.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
That is, it is one of the directions of the science of the soul.

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
The program was proclaimed in 1913 by the American researcher John Watson,

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
who believed that it was necessary to study not consciousness, but behavior.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
That's where they are called behaviorists.

15:36.000 --> 15:45.000
They studied a person's reaction, his reaction to some things happening from the outside,

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
that is, to certain irritants, let's say, external.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Studying the direct connections of stimuli and reactions, reflexes,

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
behaviorism attracted the attention of psychologists to study the skills, skills and experience.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
He opposed psychoanalysis.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Behaviorism initiated various psychological and psychotherapeutic schools.

16:12.000 --> 16:19.000
By the way, today, not so fashionable as it was fashionable 10 years ago,

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
the so-called NLP, Neuro-linguistic programming.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
It is very controversial how useful it is, how useless it is,

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
what this NLP actually affects when it affects a person.

16:38.000 --> 16:52.000
But the basis for NLP and behavioral therapy was behaviorism.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
That is, the brick Freud, Pavlov and behaviorism.

16:56.000 --> 17:05.000
These are three bricks on which various tendencies, schools, theories arose and collapsed.

17:05.000 --> 17:13.000
It is interesting to note that the Americans had an ambiguous relationship with Sigmund Freud.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
For example, psychoanalysis was, let's say, almost devoted to anathemas,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
and they thought it was a false science.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
Although then they reduced the momentum a little and decided that, probably, it was not a false science,

17:30.000 --> 17:39.000
that psychoanalysis could be used, but in psychiatry, and only those who have a doctor's diploma, a medical diploma.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
People without such a diploma cannot do psychoanalysis in America.

17:44.000 --> 17:52.000
Such things happened in the future, in the middle of the last century.

17:52.000 --> 18:01.000
In our country, with socialism, behaviorism, in general, developed in the 1930s.

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
By the way, Bekhterev was one of those who considered these issues and studied them.

18:10.000 --> 18:19.000
But, as many scientific trends in those years, they were unpopular, let's say, harmful.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
It's almost like Weissman and Morgan in genetics, for which Vavilov suffered.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
The same thing happened here.

18:29.000 --> 18:41.000
Such subtle things were considered wrong, they did not agree with the concept of the construction of communism and socialism,

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
and how science developed only abroad.

18:46.000 --> 18:54.000
Why are we going to consider Western theories and Western scientists now?

18:54.000 --> 19:03.000
Because since the 1930s, it was forbidden to do this, literally, for fear of death.

19:03.000 --> 19:14.000
And there is only one hope that now, as the country develops, as experience accumulates,

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
maybe some of you will contribute to the creation of some new theories, new trends.

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
Maybe some of you will be interested and will do this in your life.

19:28.000 --> 19:38.000
And I am sure that in 10-15 years we will have our own scientists, our own academics, our own works, our own theories, our own schools.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I would really like to hope for this.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, while this is not the case, let's see everything that was created not by us, but before us.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
Let's see what we can use and how we can use it, how useful it can be to us.

19:51.000 --> 19:59.000
And we will just take something for a note and say, I know this, it's interesting, but in this case it is not applicable, because it has accelerated.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
Or it does not match the views that I adhere to.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
To management, to business, to motivation.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
The Bifurcatian theories of motivation.

20:12.000 --> 20:22.000
The Bifurcatists noted that the term motivation is too general and, in general, not scientific enough.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
To be honest, I agree with them somewhere.

20:24.000 --> 20:36.000
It is really very general and, well, today there are so many different theories that it is more theoretical than scientific, although it can be scientific, too.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Experimental psychology, under this name, actually studies the needs.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
We will talk a lot about this.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Or the attraction of the drive.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
There is a theory of drives, that is, the theory of attraction.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
By the way, now this is a very fashionable word, drive.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Do you have a drive or do you not have a drive to work?

20:55.000 --> 21:07.000
Slang, which came to us quite recently, was used more than 80-70 years ago as one of the theories of motivation.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
Do you have a drive? That is, the movement, the attraction, to do something.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
I am motivated by work, some process.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I have a desire to drive.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Drive is like to lead, to manage.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I like to manage the process.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
And, of course, these attractions had a purely physiological nature.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Behaviorists explained behavior through the scheme of stimulus-reaction.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Again, let's remember Pavlov.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
This is their brick, on which they built their building.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Pavlov's dog.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Stimulus-reaction, unconditional and conditional.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
And considering the stimulus as an active source of reaction.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
Based on this, motivation began to be understood as a state.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
I am motivated, I have a state that makes me do something.

22:05.000 --> 22:19.000
Because the function of this state drives my body to move.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
That is, I am motivated to act, live, work, think actively.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
There is an external stimulator, of course, but it exists.

22:33.000 --> 22:41.000
For example, what is the most active stimulator for motivation, for drive?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Our boss came and said,

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
Sidorov, come to the desk and do what I told you in the morning.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Great drive, motivation, reaction.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
The boss said, under this reaction, I am quickly motivated,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I sit at the table like a bunny, I do everything.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Here is the stimulus-reaction.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Please, it doesn't work, it works, great.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The system is in action.

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
So, behaviorists considered motivation as a drive.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
As something that had a purely physiological nature.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Stimulus-reaction.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
What other theories arose?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
The theory of reinforcement of motives.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
The theory was new, but as we say, everything new is well forgotten old.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
If we remember that the theory of reinforcement of motives had a hedonic theory,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
and hedonism is an ethnic doctrine,

23:44.000 --> 23:52.000
originally developed in the ancient Greek Kyrenean school of the 4th century BC.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It's not even the last century.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
The goal of life and the highest good was to enjoy.

23:59.000 --> 24:09.000
When I was preparing for this lecture, I read it with pleasure and thought,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
how it corresponds to the spirit of our time.

24:13.000 --> 24:24.000
Many people now enjoy the good and believe that the goal of life is to achieve the good and enjoy.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
This is what they work for.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Motivation? Motivation.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Yes, this is their motivation.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Enjoyment is not a reward for the good, but the good itself.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
This was the opinion of the philosophers and Epicureans of ancient Greece.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And they are philosophers.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
It's interesting that enjoyment is not a reward, but a benefactor.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
It's a deep philosophical thought, but we won't dwell on it.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Although you can think about it on the board.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
The good is defined as something that brings enjoyment.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
If something brings me pleasure, it's good.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And if it's suffering, it's evil.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It's simple and logical.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
The Greeks formulated two principles, which are also very logical.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
The Greeks were wise in many things, including medicine.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
People strive to maximize pleasure.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
It works now.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
And people strive to minimize suffering.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It also works.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Why should I multiply my suffering when I can multiply my pleasure?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And live for pleasure.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
A great theory works for many.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
It can be said that the goal of life is to reach a certain level.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
It can be said that it's bad or good.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
There are people who think it's good.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
They accept it and they are effective.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Because it's motivation for them.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
And for someone motivation is a completely different principle.

26:12.000 --> 26:22.000
Taking the principle of hedonism as a basis, Thorndike proposed the law of effect.

26:22.000 --> 26:30.000
Behavioral reactions, which follow the perceived experience, are fixed.

26:31.000 --> 26:40.000
But if the reaction follows unpleasant experience, they disappear.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Is it logical? Yes.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Again, motivation is a reaction.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Motivation with a plus.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I will remember it.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
It's good.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
If I did this job well, and I did it like this, I will remember it.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And I was given a bonus for it.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I will remember it.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I will work like this.

27:02.000 --> 27:09.000
But if I did it like this, and I was told to do it again, I will not work like this.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Motivation and reaction.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
It works.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
There are many people and many options for applying different methods.

27:16.000 --> 27:23.000
It's perfect to have such employees who are all from the same incubator.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
And all of them listen to the same team and are motivated by something simple and ordinary.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
There are no such people.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
That's why there are so many opinions and approaches.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
So, human resources management is not only science.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
It requires colossal endurance, calmness and good health.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
So, not only Thorndike was engaged in the theory of motif reinforcement.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Ihall was engaged in this theory.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Let's pay attention again.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
There is a father, a founder, a brick, and a big building grows on it.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Again, a brick and a building.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
And then a plaza and a huge pyramid.

28:04.000 --> 28:13.000
He, as a habit, understood the connection between the reaction and a specific stimulus,

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
which arose as a result of positive reinforcement or punishment.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
He didn't offer anything radically different from Thorndike.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
He just deepened and developed it.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
He changed his mind a little.

28:31.000 --> 28:39.000
In principle, the theory of motif reinforcement has several authors.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
They looked at the same thing from different points of view.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
This also has a right to life.

28:46.000 --> 28:55.000
Skinner demonstrated that behavior can be effectively changed by reinforcing the desirable and ignoring the undesirable.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
Let's manage people this way.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
We will actively highlight and praise those who are effective.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
And we will not react to those who do not work very well.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
We will not scold them.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
We will not offend or insult them.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
We will not make them react in a way that will make them close themselves.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
By the way, this is a really interesting approach.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
It can also be used today.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
We can actively reward, raise salaries, motivate with education,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
give vouchers for rest to all families,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
to the best employees,

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
so that others would be envious of this theory,

29:47.000 --> 29:58.000
but so that others would want to succeed next year.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
I agree with him that he left the punishment.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
Punishment can force, change behavior.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
Punishment never leads to efficiency.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
If we take the history of our country,

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
which has been talked about a lot in recent decades,

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
there were many films about the system of camps, the system of punishment.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
One of the theories is that we have become such a power

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
because we want to ask the question,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
if there were no camps,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
maybe we would have become an even bigger power,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
even more interesting, strong,

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
and maybe we would not have had the shocks that happened.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Maybe punishment is not necessary.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
An interesting point.

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
In this case, I like Skinner because he does not reject,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
he just lowers the punishment.

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
Maybe in management, for some it is not his style,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
and for some it is the style that a person was looking for,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
or the one that he uses in everyday work.

31:15.000 --> 31:25.000
There is a group of theorists,

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
let's say, theorists who are already closer to us in time,

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
who, using those bricks and foundations,

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
began to develop more, let's say,

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
deep and motivated theories.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
The most famous, the first brick in this pyramid,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
is Abraham Maslow.

31:54.000 --> 32:02.000
He is followed by Alderfer, McLelland,

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
and he is written and pronounced differently,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Herzberg,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
but more often Herzberg,

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
although if you see it written differently,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
you mean that it is the same person.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
Let's consider the theory of each of them.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
All of them are based on the theory of Abraham Maslow,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
so we will dwell on his theory in detail.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
If you remember, a few slides ago I said

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
that even in Western companies,

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
although this theory has been around for more than 40 years,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
the most common knowledge is Maslow's theory,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
which is known by the management.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
In principle, of course, the theory is really interesting,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
controversial, but in any case,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
it reflects in great detail

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
the various motivational principles

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
that exist in a person.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
Let's consider the content theory of motivation in detail.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
After we consider it,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
I advise you to return to this slide

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
and look at everything highlighted in blue,

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
what makes one different from the other,

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
although they are all on the same foundation.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Maslow's theory.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
The main brick.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
The main one for building a pyramid.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Everyone later relied on this theory,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
argued with it, agreed, disagreed,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
refined, developed.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
Abraham Maslow divided the needs

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
into primary and secondary.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
In total, there were 5 steps.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
There are more detailed maps,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
if someone is interested,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
he can already see the primary.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
In general, I do not advise any literature

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
on this topic,

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
I do not advise reading any analytical.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
If you are interested,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
read only the primary sources.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
You are smart, educated, interested people.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Make your own conclusions.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Analyze yourself.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
First, it will be your personal experience,

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
and the experience that will be imposed on your practice.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
It is individual, unique, exclusive.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
And no one will tell you better than the primary source

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
about the theory of hierarchy of Maslow's needs,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
like Maslow himself.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
So, in this case, in this lesson,

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
these are the strokes, this is the quintessence.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
If you want to dig deeper,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
go to the primary source.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Read Freud, read Maslow,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
read someone else,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
those who interested you.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
No, you will have enough knowledge

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
to understand where it comes from,

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
and what can be used for yourself.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
That is, the main aspects,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
the squeeze, the Rakhmetov method.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
We read only what we need,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
because all people are busy,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
everyone is in business, there is no time.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
If I want to do it for the soul,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I go to the primary source.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
So, Maslow.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Five steps.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
The first, the simplest.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Water, air, food.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
We cannot do without it.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
This is physiology, this is our physiological needs.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
The second step.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Safety.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
It is really very important

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
to have a stable job.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
This is safety.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
And to have a permanent source of income.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Medical care is also safety.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
The third step.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
The need for social contacts,

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
belonging to any organization.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The fourth step.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
The need for recognition.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
Look, each step adds.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
It does not mean that if a person has a need for support

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
or recognition,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
he does not need the physiological needs of water, air, food.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
One of the other.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Therefore, this is a pyramid.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
And the last and the highest is the need for self-expression,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
in the disclosure of one's own abilities,

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
in creativity, in various relationships,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
in growth, in everything.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Are all five steps inherent in everything?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Yes and no.

36:49.000 --> 36:55.000
Depending on how much we need it today.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Imagine a person who is 20 years old,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
35 and 65.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
What needs will they have?

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
I think that probably the one who is 25

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
will have all five needs.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
He will need the need for self-expression,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
for self-expression,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
and will definitely need to disclose it.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Who is 65 will have enough needs in safety.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
He has already achieved everything in life,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
he has already seen everything.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
He has visited all roles,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
in all capacities.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Now he is already old.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
We all have a physiological need.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
But for him to have a stable pension,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
on which he can live,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
medical care,

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
this is a need for safety for him.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
So that no one would attack him on the street.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
And he will live his life perfectly

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
in his country house or at home,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
reading books, going to museums,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
meeting friends.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
He may not need social contacts.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
For someone it is necessary,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
they will go to the theater, to the museum.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
For someone the need for recognition will be needed.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Such people continue to work.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
These are creative people,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
change managers, people who work

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
until 80-90 years old.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
If we take people of science, actors,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and many other specialties.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
It does not matter,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
it can be a person of a working specialty,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
who continues to work

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
when he is over 70.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
He just has needs

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
that do not allow him to stop

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
and calmly go to rest.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
These needs

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
actually depend on the state

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
in which we see

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
a person.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Either he becomes in a state of rest,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
or he is looking for something in life,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
because he goes further and further

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
on this ladder.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Let's start with the third stage.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Because the first, physiological,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
and the second are very simple and understandable.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
The third stage is social needs.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
For work,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
for us, a person in an organization.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
What does it mean?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
For managers.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
How can I provide my employees

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
with this need?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
How can I create

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
a single team at work?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
How many trainings are there

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
now, even out-of-town,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
on team building, on creating a team?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Here it is, the third need.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Periodically hold

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
general meetings

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
of the general and managerial staff.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Do not destroy informal groups

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
without need.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Why?

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
We have not yet talked about informal groups.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
They exist

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
in every organization.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Absolutely in every one.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Some with a plus sign, others with a minus sign.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
There are their formal and informal leaders.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Often informal leaders

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
can be stronger than formal leaders.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
How to influence and how to fight?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
In theory, this is a topic of a separate lecture.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And it would be ideal

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
to include conflictology,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
psychology, psychotypes,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
management of conflicts

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
and stress-resistance.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
All together.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Because it is a very serious

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
and deep topic.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
In principle,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
the advice is this.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
If there are informal groups,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
it is not recommended to destroy them.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
This is a fact.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
But try to control them

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
or at least keep your hand on the pulse.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
What is going on?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
What kind of leader?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
How does he influence?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Maybe he has a positive influence on everyone.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Or vice versa.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
If you touch it, it will be harmful to the organization.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Try to control without destroying.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Create conditions for the

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
activity of employees outside the organization.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Corporate holidays are very popular now.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
There is no such company

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
where corporate holidays

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
were not held at least in the New Year.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
In any. Absolutely.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
General outings,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
summer holidays,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
barbecue, sports events.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
For example,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
a coffee shop is very important.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
If you have a huge office

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and there is a coffee shop on the floors,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
where people can come to pour coffee,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
tea, water, talk,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
communicate.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
It is very important.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
By the way, I did not write,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
but a smoking room is also a place

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
where a person satisfies

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
social needs.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
This is a place where you can find out,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
hear the latest news, gossip.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Everything that

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
is often not heard

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
at meetings.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
An amazing place.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Smoking is now prohibited in many companies.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
So the center

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
was placed in a coffee shop.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
If there were no coffee shops,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
it would be nice to create them.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
The fourth step is the need for respect.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Indeed,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
when I respect a person,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I trust him.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I can give a person

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
more substantive work,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
evaluate and encourage employees,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
show respect to them,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
provide some additional rights,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
impose some additional

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
duties on a person.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I trust, I respect a person,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I trust him

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
more authority.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
A lot of things

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
can be done in your team,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
satisfying the need for respect.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
And this need exists

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
in every person who works.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Any person

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
wants to be respected

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
in the team,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
appreciated.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
It is very important.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Any person is pleased

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
to hear

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
from time to time

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
that he or she likes how you work.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Well done.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
It is very important.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
There is no real leadership

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
in this.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
People react to such comments

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
more emotionally,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
there is a surge of

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
more efficiency

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
than a bonus.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
A bonus is a bonus.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Yes, I earned it, it is pleasant.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
But you work very well,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
keep working,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I watch you, well done.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It is often expensive.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Very expensive,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
but it is very important

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
to work with a leader

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
and with his or her colleagues.
