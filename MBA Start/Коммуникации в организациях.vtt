00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
My name is Irina Alexandrovna Evgenievna. I am a Doctor of Technical Sciences, certified business trainer.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
I have practical experience in the implementation of electronic systems of operational management of companies, electronic document system of circulation.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
I have practical experience in the construction of training system of personnel, business training.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
As a Master of Personnel Planning I am engaged in issues of interpersonal and organizational communication.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Our today's course is called Communication in organizations.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Do you know how much working time the manager spends on communication?

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
80% of his time or 48 minutes per hour the manager spends on meetings, phone calls, informal communication.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
The rest 20% of the time or 12 minutes goes to work at the table, most of which is the same communication, only in the form of reading or writing.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
That is, the efficiency of the manager's activities is completely dependent on the efficiency of his communication.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Information exchange is included as the most important link in all basic types of organization activity.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Therefore, if communication connections do not exist or do not work, this negatively affects the work of the entire company.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
The manager spends a lot of time looking for the necessary information.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Often information duplication occurs.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
In some departments, its disadvantage is noticed, while in others there may be information overload.

01:27.000 --> 01:36.000
The lack of information about the plans and prospects of the organization leads to the failure to comply with the instructions of the management, to the weakening of the motivation of employees.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
That is why creating conditions for successful communication in the organization is one of the most important tasks of the management,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
and communication skills are a necessary condition for the success of each manager.

01:50.000 --> 02:00.000
During the first part of the course, you will get an idea of ​​communication as in a circular process and get acquainted with the concept of the capacity of communication channels.

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
The second part of the course is dedicated to the communication barriers in the interpersonal communication, their influence on the productivity and efficiency of communication.

02:09.000 --> 02:18.000
In the third part, organizational communications, the difference between formal and informal organizational communications,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
their importance for management, the influence of the structure on communication in teams,

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
the technical support of the organizational communication processes, the role of open communications, dialogue and feedback in a modern workplace are considered in the fourth part of our course.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
During the implementation of practical tasks and solving cases, you will acquire practical skills in building effective communications in your organization.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Our course is connected with other courses that you have probably already taken.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
These are option management, business communication, business psychology, organizational structure building.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
Perhaps some topics will be interlinked with these courses, but I will focus my attention on those points that you have not yet heard of.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Communication

03:12.000 --> 03:28.000
Communication is a process in which two or more people exchange and realize the received information.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
The purpose of the process is to motivate a certain behavior or influence it.

03:34.000 --> 03:43.000
From the general management course, you know that Henry Mintzberg has identified 10 managerial roles that a manager plays in his workplace.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Let's take a closer look at the information role of a manager.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
A manager can act as a recipient of information.

03:52.000 --> 04:03.000
He searches and receives information of a specialized nature, which, understanding the organization and external conditions, is successfully used in the interests of his business.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
He acts as a kind of center of external and internal information that comes to the organization.

04:10.000 --> 04:19.000
He processes all the mail, makes contacts related to the receipt of information, for example, reads periodic publications or goes on introductory trips.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
As a distributor of information, he transmits the information received from external sources or from other subordinates to the members of the organization.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
Some of this information is purely factual, while others require interpretation of certain facts to form the organization's views.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
Mail sending to organizations in order to provide information is his job.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
He also makes verbal contacts with members of the organization to clarify some information.

04:50.000 --> 05:00.000
A manager, as a representative, transmits information to external contacts in the organization regarding plans, policies, actions, results of the organization's work.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
He acts as an expert on the issues of this industry.

05:04.000 --> 05:14.000
He participates in meetings, in emails, perhaps, makes oral speeches, including information transmission to external organizations.

05:15.000 --> 05:23.000
Note that both interpersonal roles and roles related to decision-making also require active communication from the manager.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
Considering communication in business as a scientific applied discipline also determines the approach, point of view on the processes in business.

05:33.000 --> 05:44.000
We can talk about the so-called communicative approach in management, when the organization considers, first of all, how the relationship between people, between groups.

05:45.000 --> 05:58.000
For example, from the point of view of the communicative approach, management of personnel is an organization of communication related to the activities of individual people and groups in the interests of the organization and in their own interests.

05:58.000 --> 06:12.000
For example, marketing is the communication of the organization with market objects regarding the determination of market needs and the possibility of their satisfaction, or about the means and ways of promoting goods and services of the organization to the market.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
Conflictology is the study of communication, based on which the contradictions of the interests of the parties lie.

06:20.000 --> 06:29.000
From the point of view of communication with the public, it is the study of the problem of forming a positive idea of the organization, of its products, of its services.

06:30.000 --> 06:39.000
From the point of view of advertising, it is communication with the aim of attracting attention, forming interest, desire, activity of the buyers of goods.

06:40.000 --> 06:51.000
From the point of view of corporate culture, it is an important component of the culture, it is communication. In fact, corporate culture is a culture of communication, a culture of management.

06:52.000 --> 07:05.000
Communication penetrates all management functions. For example, what is planning? It is a collection of information, writing, notes, reports. It is a meeting with colleagues and managers, an explanation of their plans.

07:06.000 --> 07:17.000
When a manager acts as a leader, he must communicate with his subordinates to motivate them to work. When he is in control, he is also obliged to collect information.

07:18.000 --> 07:26.000
It is because the exchange of information is built into all the basic types of management activity, we call communication a connecting process.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
The typology of business communication is presented on slide 11.

07:31.000 --> 07:45.000
Communication is a process associated with interpersonal and organizational communication when transferring information both inside the organization and from the external environment. Therefore, communication can be divided into external and internal.

07:46.000 --> 08:02.000
The factors of the external environment, such as consumers, suppliers, competitors, determine the composition and content of external communications. Moreover, internal communications are often a reaction to the changing characteristics of the external environment.

08:03.000 --> 08:12.000
Organizations use a variety of means of communication with the external environment. For example, they communicate with consumers through a variety of advertising.

08:12.000 --> 08:22.000
They provide relevant reports to the Tax Inspection. In the sphere of relations with the public, they form their image, carry out some charity activity.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
They use their advertising, their raw materials, components, conclude contracts on deliveries with suppliers.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
Internal communications are communications between structural units and individual performers.

08:39.000 --> 08:50.000
In the framework of vertical communications, information is transferred from level to level within the organization. At the same time, information can be transmitted both in ascending and in descending.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
In the case of descending, information is transmitted from the highest levels to the lowest, playing the role of direct communication.

08:58.000 --> 09:08.000
In the case of ascending, communication from bottom to top performs the function of feedback, informing the managers about the state of affairs at the lower levels.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
The organization consists of a large number of units closely interconnected with each other.

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
The coordination of the activities of all these units, in addition to descending and ascending vertical information, is needed in horizontal communications.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
Vertical and horizontal communications are considered to act within the official structure of the organization,

09:32.000 --> 09:40.000
according to the line of formal subordination, formal hierarchy, and also according to the lines of formal subordination of horizontal interaction.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
However, informal communications also play an important role within the organization, which act within the informal structure.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
Information is transmitted through informal channels much faster than through formal channels.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Often, managers use informal communications for planned information leakage.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
The term communication itself appeared in scientific literature at the beginning of the 20th century,

10:08.000 --> 10:17.000
although probably the very first model of communication was proposed by Aristotle, who highlighted such components of the communication process as orator, speech, and audience.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
The first to study the communication processes in the organization were the representatives of the School of Science and Management.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
In particular, Frederick Taylor developed a rigid organizational structure, which was later improved by Henri Fayol,

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
which involves a clear interconnection between positions and roles.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
This structure only includes vertical and horizontal communications from the managers to subordinates.

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
That is, such an organization is based on formal, extremely rigid, vertical, and hierarchical communication connections.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
Information is transmitted vertically, divided into two types, tasks and the necessary explanation for it.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Taylor called it a lesson, as well as control over the execution of the task.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
At the same time, feedback during control is reduced only to a report on the execution of the task.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
In general, it can be said that this scientific school did not attach much importance to the communication in the organization.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
According to the basic concept of the School of Human Relations, a person is a unique social animal,

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
therefore, no formalization of organizational processes and a rigid hierarchy of subordinates can be combined with his activity.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
On the contrary, horizontal organizational connections of informal nature between members of the organization are of great importance.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
These connections should facilitate the functioning of the formal organization

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
and ensure the unity of the collective and the protection of the integrity of the personality.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
However, representatives of the School of Human Relations paid attention to mostly informal communication

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
between the employees of the organization with different statuses, forgetting about their interaction with the administration,

11:59.000 --> 12:10.000
as well as the flow of business information necessary for the performance of their role duties.

12:11.000 --> 12:18.000
All system theories claim that the connections between the various system units of the organization

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
are the main point in understanding the essence of its functioning.

12:23.000 --> 12:31.000
For the effective operation of these connections, the most important role is played by the creation, obtaining and processing of information.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Considering the organization as an open system, system theories focus on its interaction with the external environment,

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
the study of the flow of information coming from other organizations and from social institutions,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
such as government, political and public institutions.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Within the framework of system theories, the information flows are analyzed

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
and the quality of the information presented as formal and informal channels is assessed,

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
as well as the number of decisions made depending on the actions of the communication system.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
The main development of communication theory was achieved relatively recently, since the late 1940s.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
It is worth paying attention to the details of those theories that are considered to be classical communication theories.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
At the end of the 1940s, at the request of Bell Telecom, the famous American mathematician Claude Shannon

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
began to develop his model of communication.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
The model described five functional and one dysfunctional factors of the communication process.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
The functional factor was the source of information, which protects the message,

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
the sender, which encodes the message into signals, the channel that conducts this message,

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
the receiver and the destination, where the dysfunctional element was noise.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
The model has a technical nature.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
The main task of this model is to reduce noise, that is, everything that hinders communication.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
The main conclusion of this model is the following.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
The inability of the participants of communication to realize that the sent and received message do not always coincide

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
due to the action of noise is a frequent cause of communication difficulties.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
This model was called Shannon-Weaver model and was continued by researcher Melvin DeFleur.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
He expanded the original model into a more developed network.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
The main drawback of the Shannon-Weaver linear model is the lack of feedback.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
Feedback allows the communicator to adapt its message to the communicative channel,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
naturally, to increase the efficiency of the transmission of information.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
The Shannon-Weaver model was a final overcoming of the simplified interpretation of communication

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
as a one-sided linear process.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
The circular nature of communication is emphasized in this model.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
The authors paid attention to the behavior of the main participants of communication,

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
the sender and the receiver, the main tasks of which are encoding, decoding

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
and interpretation of the message.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
Modern researchers of communication processes represent the process of information exchange as follows.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
The sender is the creator of the message, the one who proposes an idea

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
or creates the information on his own or accumulates the existing information for further transmission,

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
deciding what significant information can be the subject of the transmission,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
how to encode it, which channel to send the information to.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
The sender thus begins the process of communication exchange.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
The message is the information prepared for the transmission to the receiver,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
encoded using symbols, words, special sign symbols,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
tone of the message, drawings, gestures, and so on.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
In the process of encoding, that is, the transformation of the meaning of the idea into symbols,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
problems may arise, the actions of which distort the communication,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
reduce the effectiveness of the communication process.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
For example, the sender makes a message from symbols that the receiver does not understand,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
has not met in his previous experience or interprets incorrectly.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
The channel of information transmission is a means of information transmission

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
or a path, a path of actual transmission of the message.

16:39.000 --> 16:48.000
The understanding and acceptance of the received message depends on the quality of the channel of information transmission

16:49.000 --> 16:57.000
and a lot depends on whether the leader can adjust to the individual system of perception of information by the individual.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
At the same time, the following channels of information transmission are different.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
Speech channel, transmission of written materials, electronic means of communication, such as computer networks,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
video conferences, email.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.000
The receiver is a person or a group or an organization to which information is transmitted

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
and which interprets or decodes it.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
The interpretation of the message of the receiver is not always successful.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Incorrect interpretation is often due to the lack of language,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
perception, culture, differences in the interests of the sender or receiver.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Noise is all that distorts the meaning of the message.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
This is an element that is actually present in all communications.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
At each stage, there are possible noises.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
The sources of noise that make it difficult to understand the meaning of the message

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
are the differences in the perception of information,

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
which affect the clarity of the meaning when encoding and decoding.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
This is a mismatch and a difference in the official status,

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
that is, a different vision of the goals, tasks of the organization, its units,

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
and the features of the culture, the features of the language of the sender and the receiver.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
The result or effect of communication influence is a change in behavior,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
in the state of the receiver of information,

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
which can be expressed in the change in the knowledge of the receiver,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
in the change in his attitudes,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
or in the change in the individual actions of the receiver, in his behavior.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
A feedback is an operative reaction to what is heard, read or seen.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
This is information in a verbal or non-verbal form,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
which is sent back to the sender.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
It indicates the extent of understanding, the extent of trust in the message,

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
whether the message is learned or not, whether the receiver agrees with it or not.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
A feedback allows the sender not only to know the result of the communication act,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
but also to correct the following message for greater understanding,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
for greater effect of communication.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
In a recent study, an attempt was made to explain the process of choosing

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
the most effective communication channels.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
It turned out that the channels differ in the volume of transmitted information.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
The throughput or capacity of the channel is the volume of information

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
that can be transmitted through this channel during one communication session.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
The classification of channels by throughput is presented on slide 15.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Three factors affect the capacity of communication channels.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
First of all, it is the ability to process several signals and prompts at the same time.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
The second is the ability to provide fast two-way feedback.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
And finally, the last factor is the ability to provide a personal approach to communication.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
The richest means of communication in terms of these capabilities is personal communication,

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
because it guarantees direct impact, transmission of multiple information signals

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
and immediate feedback and, of course, personal approach.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
In the case of phone communication, there is no personal contact between the sender and the receiver.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Participants do not perceive the poses, the language of gestures of each other.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
However, there is a human voice, and it contains a huge amount of emotional information.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
In e-mails, there are usually no visual or verbal prompts,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding of these messages.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Realizing the need for channels with more capacity,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
managers sometimes use video signals, that is, visual prompts.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Notes and letters can also have a personal approach,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
but they cannot provide fast feedback.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
Personal communication channels are announcements, ballots, standard computer reports,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
are the most capacious.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Their throughput is limited to the greatest extent.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
Using them, the sender has no ability to focus on a particular receiver,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
transmits minimum information and does not receive feedback.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
It is obvious that each communication channel has certain advantages and disadvantages.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Each of them, depending on the type of communication,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
can be used to achieve a certain level of efficiency.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
The choice of the channel depends on whether the message is ordinary, routine or not.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
As a rule, non-standard messages are ambiguous, ambiguous,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
associated with some new event,

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
and there is a very high probability that they may be misunderstood.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Often, they are transmitted in a situation characterized by a lack of time,

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
and therefore, there is a high probability that the message is not correct.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
The most capacious channels allow to effectively convey the complexity of the situation.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
On the other hand, routine communication is simple and straightforward.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
A routine message contains various data

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
or simply attaches in a written form the information that the managers have already agreed on.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Such messages can be transmitted through less capacious channels.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
To the written form, the message is not very complicated,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
and the message is transmitted through less capacious channels.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
Writing communication has to be used when the receivers of the message are significantly removed from each other

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
or when the information has some official nature.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
The choice of the channel also depends on whether the manager simply wants to distribute the information

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
or wants to achieve changes in behavior from the subordinates.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
Recommendations for choosing a channel, depending on the purpose of communication, are presented on slide 16.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
The channel is a good place to start a conversation with your manager.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
If you have any questions, please contact us.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
We are happy to help you.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
We move on to the second topic of our lecture — interpersonal communication.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
We will discuss the issue of effectiveness and productivity of communication.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
Effective communication takes place in cases when the meaning of the message

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
and the value perceived by the receiver are practically the same.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Although this should be the goal of any communication,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
efficiency is not always achievable.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
Even now, when I am talking to you, I am not sure that you understand me exactly as I would like.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
My confidence would be much higher if you were sitting in the audience

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
and could ask some questions, meaning, I could get feedback.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
The ability to offer feedback and ask questions

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
is an important way to improve the effectiveness of communication.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
Productive communication takes place in cases when the minimum amount of resources is spent.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
For example, time is a very important resource.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Imagine a teacher who individually communicates with each student in the group

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
about the subject they are studying.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
This is almost impossible.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
But even if it were so,

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
communication with you would be too expensive in terms of time.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Productive communication is not always effective.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
If the sender sends a message via email about changes in the policy,

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
it can save him time, but not always lead to a positive result,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
that is, to the desired interpretation and response.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
Similarly, effective communication is not always productive.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
If the production manager personally approaches each worker

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
and explains all the changes in the procedure to him,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
it can guarantee that everyone will understand it correctly.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
However, this will be unacceptable and expensive in terms of time.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Effective communication between managers and other people

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
implies the need to use all the elements presented in the communication model.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
If the sender or receiver is unable to encode or decode the message in a similar way,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
the communication process is interrupted.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
The choice of the channel also largely determines the interference resistance of the messages.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
The ability of both parties to listen depends on whether the message is correctly perceived and received.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Thus, effective communication requires the knowledge of the interpersonal factors

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
that influence the communication process from the manager,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
such as channels of communication, non-verbal behavior,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
the ability to listen, the ability to provide high-quality feedback.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
In the process of interpersonal communication,

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
information can be presented in a verbal, paraverbal and non-verbal form.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
If verbal communications are directly related to the content of the transmitted information,

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
then paraverbal and nonverbal communications demonstrate the attitude of the interlocutors to it

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
and thus largely determine the effectiveness of the information assimilation to its addressee.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
It is believed that from the total flow of information

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
that a person perceives in the process of communication,

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
up to 80% is non-verbal and paraverbal information,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
and only up to 20% is the words themselves.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
The use of psychotechnologies,

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
originally developed in psychotherapy and intended to increase the degree of influence on the interlocutor,

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
sharply increases the productivity of interpersonal communication.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
You can get acquainted with such technologies

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
during the study of the course on the psychology of business communication.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
We only focus on those communication barriers

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
that arise in the process of interpersonal interaction.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
It is very important to remember about the seven sources of noise

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
that are most often encountered in interpersonal communication.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
First of all, this is the inability to listen to the interlocutor,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
this is physical distortion,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
this is semantic problems,

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
this is mixed messages,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
cultural differences

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
and the absence of feedback,

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
as well as the effects of status.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Those who are able to listen understand the skills of receiving messages,

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
to highlight the facts and feelings contained in them,

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
and to correctly interpret their meaning.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Only then does the manager have the opportunity

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
to adequately respond to the original message.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
The ability to listen requires attention from a person,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
energy expenditure, and a certain experience.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
Listening is 75% of effective communication.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
At the same time, most people spend only 30 or 40% of their communication time on it.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
This leads to numerous communication errors.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Many people do not know how to listen to their interlocutors.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
They are concerned, first of all, about what they will say,

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
not what they are told.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Our ability to listen,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
expressed in the volume of understood and memorized material,

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
on average does not exceed 25%.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
A person who can listen to an interlocutor

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
finds interesting topics in conversation,

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
conducts a conversation flexibly,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
summarizes the received information in a thoughtful way,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
evaluates and predicts the information

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
that he will receive in the next minute.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
The correct approach to listening suggests

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
that you do not think about yourself,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
but empathize, participate emotionally in the dialogue,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and penetrate the feelings of the interlocutor.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
Therefore, a certain level of development of emotional abilities is necessary for this.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
This is called empathy.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
As an example of a sample listener,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
we can give some talk show presenters.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
For example, the famous TV presenter Vladimir Molchanov

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
actively listens to guests in the studio.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
He does not allow himself to be distracted,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
he concentrates all his attention on the speakers.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
He establishes eye contact,

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
he listens with empathy,

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
he participates emotionally in the conversation.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
He never interrupts the interlocutor

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
and at the end rephrases the statement of the interlocutor.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
In order to make sure that he understood him correctly.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Thanks to Vladimir Molchanov's developed ability to listen,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
his guests feel themselves desirable, understood and significant.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Compare this talk show, let them say,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
where the presenter does not have the skills of listening.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Any number of physical distortions

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
can also reduce the effectiveness of communication.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It is necessary to exclude such interference as

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
phone calls, random visitors, the arrival of a secretary.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Semantic communication barriers include

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
a bad choice of words or improper use of them.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
In general, semantics studies the ways of using words

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
and the meanings given by words.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Since words or symbols can have different meanings for different people,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
what someone is going to say

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
will not necessarily be interpreted and understood

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
in the same way by the recipient of information.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
The full dictionary of English

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
provides more than 14,000 possible definitions

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
for 500 most common words.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
A leader who tells a subordinate

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
that the report is adequate

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
may mean that it is complete and meets the goals.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
However, a subordinate can decode it in a different way.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
For example, he can understand that the report is incomplete

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
or needs improvement or is out of order.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Studies have shown that managers and leaders of different levels

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
give the same meaning to words such as status,

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
incentive, quota, cooperation, budget, and other words.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Semantic difficulties can also be caused

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
by the divergence of the ways

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
by which people assign meanings to groups of symbols.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
This moment is of great importance for communication.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
For example, if you tell your subordinate

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
to do something as soon as you are given the opportunity,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
what do you really mean?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
As soon as possible or as soon as you have time?

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Semantic barriers can create communication problems

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
for companies operating in a multinational environment.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Another problem is overloading of the message.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Overloading can be caused by an abundance of professional terms

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
and expressions that are not always understood

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
by employees of other departments or other organizations.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Complex language obscures people's consciousness,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
and great strategic ideas are almost always described in short words,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
as Jack Trout said.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
When there is a doubt about the clarity of a written or oral message,

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
Trout advised to remember the well-known principle of kiss communication.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Keep it short and smile.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
We are talking about mixed messages,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
in those cases when words convey one message,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
and the body language is different.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
It is very important to follow the body language,

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
because non-verbal symbols are able to give a key to understanding

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
what should actually be said during a personal conversation.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
They highlight three sources of information signals

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
that are transmitted in a decent communication.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
These are the words that are spoken,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
the voice, i.e. the tension of the voice, intonation, tone,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and the expression of the person-interlocutor.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
As for the weight of these three factors

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
when interpreting messages,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
verbal impact is 7% of the total amount of communication,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
voice is 38%,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
and the expression of the person is 55% of the total amount of received information.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
It is obvious that it is not important what is said,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
but how it is said, how words are pronounced.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Non-verbal messages convey thoughts and feelings

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
much more effectively than any of the most carefully selected words.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
And all verbal and non-verbal messages can contradict each other.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
In this case, the recipient comes to a confusion.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
What did the person want to say?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
To what extent should we trust his words,

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
his behavior?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Studies show that non-verbal symbols are usually trusted.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Cultural differences.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
In the conditions of globalization, for many companies,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
moving employees within the framework of the international office

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
becomes one of the main principles of work.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
This helps to educate leaders who can manage international business.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
However, often the results shown by a manager in one country

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
can be completely different in another country.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It can be not so effective.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
This is due to national features,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
various ways of doing business,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
and culture and relations between people in different countries.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
Under the influence of culture, relations to work are formed,

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
relations to time, to their colleagues, to goals, to lifestyle.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
These values ​​have a huge importance for a successful business of a company.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
For example, Americans are considered to be big individualists.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
They are independent and independent.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Their motivation is based solely on personal benefit.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
Their success is measured by the amount of money.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Therefore, they save time, they value punctuality,

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
they live on schedule.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Representatives of courageous cultures, such as Japan, Germany, America,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
are aimed at achieving results.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
They are ready for competition.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
They are aggressive in their business.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Women's cultures, such as Russia, Ukraine or the Baltic States,

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
consider work not as a goal, but as a means of comfort.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Excessive control by the company management

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
will be perceived by the Western manager as a sign of distrust.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
On the contrary, representing the complete freedom of action

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
to an employee from Russia or Ukraine,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
the manager risks not to get any results.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Another example of the influence of cultural features

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
is the process of merging the German Daimler company with the American Chrysler.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
As a result, the joint company had problems

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
that initially seemed unimportant.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
For Germans who are used to smoking and drinking beer for lunch,

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
and Americans who lead a more British lifestyle,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
it was necessary to create certain rules of conduct in the office

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
that would be comfortable for all participants in the process.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Today, international standards of business communication

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
developed by the World Trade Association have been adopted.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
The standards include the rules of conduct in the business environment,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
the rules of business negotiations,

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
the rules of reception,

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
the handover of protocol gifts, and so on.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
In the context of globalization,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
these standards significantly facilitate intercultural communication

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
and allow to avoid many conflict situations.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
The study of the specified standards

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
is included in almost all training programs

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
for preparing managers for foreign economic activity.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
International business experts advise

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
to study the language of the country where you are going

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
at least in a minimal volume for a better understanding of cultural differences,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
with the representatives of which you plan to have a business.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
Perhaps the prospect of studying a foreign language may sound frightening,

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
but the results are quite justified by the efforts made.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
The feedback allows the manager to determine

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
how effective or ineffective his communication is.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
We have already talked about the possibility of feedback

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
when we talked about the communication model.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
But despite all the significance,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
feedback is often not paid enough attention to,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and in the process of interpersonal communication

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
feedback requires special attention.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Feedback is a deliberate message to another person

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
about the actions that lead to the achievement of the goal

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
and those that lead to the results that do not meet the goals of the organization.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
Feedback functions are support and encouragement of actions

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
that lead to success and give the desired result,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
or change of ineffective behavior.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
The ability to provide both positive and negative feedback

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
is a necessary component of the effective leader's communicative competence.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
It is appropriate to provide feedback to subordinates

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
in accordance with the following principles.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Feedback should be balanced.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
If feedback is too critical,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
the subordinate may internally reject it.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
If feedback is too praiseworthy,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
it may be perceived as protection, which will also cause a negative effect.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
Feedback should combine positive and negative points.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
Balancing should be done in order to make feedback acceptable for the subordinate

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
depending on his nationality, culture, and personal characteristics.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Feedback should be specific.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Feedback is not a place for discussion

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
whether the subordinate said or did something.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
The leader should always address a specific fact or action.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Avoid generalizing phrases such as

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
«you are always», «you are inclined».

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Feedback is about what was done or said,

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
how and why.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Guesses about someone's motives

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
bring an atmosphere of distrust and hostility into communication.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Feedback should be understandable.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
The leader should use a language understandable for the subordinate,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
without jargon and unfamiliar words.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Feedback should be active.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
The subordinate should not remain a passive listener.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
He should be actively involved in the process of changing his behavior

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
to achieve certain tasks.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
In order to make the feedback process more active,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
it is useful to ask the subordinate himself,

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
to make comments about his behavior,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
about his knowledge or about his skills.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Feedback should be comparable.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Progress is made if the subordinate can compare

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
how he performed a specific task

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
with his previous attempts.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Feedback should be directed at behavior.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Feedback focuses attention on behavior,

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
not on the Personality as such.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
You should talk about what people do,

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
not what you think about them.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Thus, you can tell someone

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
that he spoke the most at the meeting,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
instead of saying «you are too talkative».

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
The first phrase leaves room for change in behavior,

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
while the second phrase simply states that he is talkative,

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
emphasizes a certain feature of his character.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Feedback should be sufficient.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
When a person performs his work,

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
he makes some efforts and tries.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Therefore, if he receives some kind of fleeting feedback,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
especially in the case of a long-awaited achievement,

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
he may have a feeling

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
that his efforts were unnoticed.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
This can lead to demotivation of an employee.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The so-called Russell feedback formula

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
has been widely spread.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
According to it,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
the supervisor should follow this algorithm

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
in the process of presenting feedback to an employee.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
First of all, let the employee see

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
what he did on specific facts.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Show him the consequences of this behavior

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
and outline further actions to change this behavior.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
Depending on the situation and personal characteristics,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
people differ in the fact

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
that they can receive a different number of feedback.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Each critical word is a drop that gets into a certain vessel.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
If you listen carefully and actively,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
you can understand that this vessel is approaching its fullness.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
If a person is willing to receive a comment,

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
he says,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
«Yes, now I see it, I know,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I would like to hear even more comments».

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
If the vessel is close to its fullness,

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
you can hear such comments.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
«I think I don't understand», «No, I didn't do that»,

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
«Maybe yes, maybe no».

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
This means that feedback should be stopped

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
and waited for when a person will learn what you have said.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Status and differences in existing organizations

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
create potential communication barriers

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
between people of different ranks.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
On the one hand, using the power of one's own status,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
managers may be inclined to talk a lot and listen little.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
On the other hand, communication is often distorted

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
when there is a rising flow

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
in the hierarchical structure of the organization.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Subordinates can filter information

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
and tell their leader only what,

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
in their opinion, they would like to hear.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
No matter what the reason is,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
fear of retribution for bad news

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
or a desire to admit one's mistakes

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
or a general mood to do something pleasant,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
as it always leads to the same result.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
That is, a person who makes decisions at a high level

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
can make mistakes

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
due to distortion or inaccurate information

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
that came from below.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
To avoid such problems,

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
managers and group leaders

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
should build trustworthy working relations

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
with subordinates and members of the group,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
taking all the advantages of communication face to face.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Currently, the most popular way

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
to build trust is the management of walking methods.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
This method means

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
that the leader should only regularly leave his office

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
and talk to people at work.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Managers who spend a lot of time this way

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
significantly reduce the distance

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
between themselves and their subordinates.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
This helps to create an atmosphere of open

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
and free communication between people,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
regardless of their official position.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
As a result, when making decisions,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
the leader has more information at his disposal,

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
and at the same time decisions

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
meet the needs of the workers.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
What is the role of communication in the organization?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
We move on to another aspect of communication

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
related to the organization as a whole.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
On the organization scale,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
communication is usually carried out in three directions.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
From top to bottom, from bottom to top,

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
and in a horizontal plane.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Information in the organization

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
is distributed both on formal and informal channels.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
Formal channels coincide with the hierarchical levels in the organization.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
The organizational structure determines

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
which way the official information,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
the official message,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
should go from one hierarchical level to another.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
Since formal channels are recognized as official,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
they are used for the transfer of politics, procedures,

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
and other official messages.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
On the other hand,

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
informal channels form the main network.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
They have nothing to do with the hierarchy of power in the organization.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
They exist together with the formal channels,

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
but often differ from them,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
jumping over hierarchical levels.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Informal channels contribute to the creation of open communications

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
in the organization

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
and ensure that the right people

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
will get in touch with each other.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Managers should create and support

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
formal channels of communication in all directions.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
In addition, informal channels are at their disposal.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Simply put, every manager has the opportunity

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
to get out of the office at least once,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
walk through the production workshops

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
and talk to employees.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
The most obvious stream of formal communications

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
that we are familiar with

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
is the descending communication.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
It consists of messages and information

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
sent by the company's higher management.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Communications from top to bottom

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
can take various forms.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
The most common are speeches,

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
messages in corporate publications,

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
by email,

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
investments in envelopes,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
salary, information sheets,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
messages on the boards of announcements,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
and some reference manuals

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
handed down by the company's management.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
In addition,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
the manager determines the content of communications.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
It is almost impossible to keep employees

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
aware of everything

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
that is happening in the organization.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Therefore, the manager must choose

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
the most important information

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
from all existing information.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
As a rule, the descending communications

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
cover the following topics.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
The management's understanding of goals and strategies.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
The manager's understanding of new strategies and goals

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
provides employees with information

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
about specific tasks,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
specific plans

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
and the behavior expected from them.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
The information obtained

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
determines the main areas

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
in which the organization's lower levels will operate.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
For example,

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
we are starting a new program

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
to improve the quality of production.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Its success determines the possibility

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
of increasing our share in the market

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
by 45%.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
This is the message

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
about goals and strategies.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
The management's instructions and orders.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
These are directives

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
describing the performance of a specific task

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
and its connection with other types of organization activities.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
For example,

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
in connection with the repair of workshop No. 2,

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
the procurement department must provide

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
the supply of necessary building materials.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
The procedures and various rules.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
In such messages,

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
the policy, rules, norms,

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
and structure of the organization are described.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
For example,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
after 90 days of work in the company,

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
an employee receives the opportunity

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
to purchase child benefits in the preventive care unit.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
The feedback on the results of the activity.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Such messages contain information

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
about how well or badly

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
individual employees or departments

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
perform their work tasks.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
For example,

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Nikolai Ivanovich,

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
the company's performance

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
over the computer network

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
and the efficiency of the procurement process

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
has significantly increased.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Implementation of ideas.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
These messages are intended

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
to motivate employees

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
to take on the company's missions,

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
its cultural values,

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
to participate in special ceremonies

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
such as joint evenings.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
An example of such a message

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
is the employee of the company

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
«This is one family.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
We are happy to invite you

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
to our company.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
The main problem

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
of the descending information flows

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
is dispersion.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
That is, complete distortion

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
or complete disappearance

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
of the original meaning of the message.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
That is, complete distortion

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
or complete disappearance

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
of the original meaning of the message.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Yes, formal communication

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
is one of the most effective ways

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
to bring information

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
to the employees of the company.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
But at the same time,

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
the employees of the company

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
are not able to

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
communicate with the company

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
in a formal way.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
This is due to the fact

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
that the company

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
has a very limited

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
number of employees.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
The number of employees

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
is very small.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
The number of employees

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
is very small.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
The number of employees

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
is very small.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
The first person

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
is invited to the room

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
and the first person

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
passes on everything he remembers

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
from this message.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Then the next person is invited

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
to whom the second person

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
passes on everything he remembers,

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
everything he heard,

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
and so on.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
I'm sure you'll laugh

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
when you hear

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
what the last person

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
in this chain will say.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Thus, the information

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
is practically impossible.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
However, with the help of the methods

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
we talked about in the previous sections,

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
the losses can be significantly reduced.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
To do this, it is necessary to choose

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
the most adequate communication channel,

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
to achieve the correspondence

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
of verbal and non-verbal messages,

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
to actively listen,

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
to make the message

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
and to take into account the perception of the recipient.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
The flow of rising communications

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
forms the message

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
transmitted from the lowest levels of the organization

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
to the highest levels of the hierarchy.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
The following five types of messages

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
are related to the flow of communication.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
First of all, these are problems and questions.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
For example,

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
the printer has not been working for two days,

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
and a new one will be received

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
no earlier than in a week.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Suggestions for improvement.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
New ideas

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
regarding improving various procedures,

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
improving the quality or effectiveness of work

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
can also be passed on this way.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
For example,

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
I believe it is necessary to abandon

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
step number two of the audit procedure,

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
because it takes a lot of time

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
and does not affect the result in any way.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
The next type of such messages

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
is reports on the results of the activity.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
The top managers

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
periodically receive reports

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
on the work of individual employees and departments.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
For example,

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
a report on the results of sales

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
will be presented on time,

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
and a report on the results of the implementation

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
of the partner program

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
will be provided in two days.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
The next type of messages

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
is reports on the results of the work.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
The results of the work

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
should be heard

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
and approved by the top management.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
For example,

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
the operation analysis manager

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
was tasked with examining

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
the process of equipment utilization,

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
but the management of the plant

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
obstructed him.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Here is the complaint.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
And the last type of messages

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
is financial and accounting information.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
These include messages

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
about the results of the work,

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
the return of investments

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
and other indicators

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
that may interest the top management.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
For example,

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
our expenses exceeded the estimated budget

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
by 2%,

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
but sales increased by 10%.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
The management of the company

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
is very interested

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
in uninterrupted and rising communications

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
and uses various channels.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
For example, boxes for notes with proposals,

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
polls of employees,

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
open-door policy,

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
information systems,

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
and direct dialogues

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
between the management and the employees.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
And yet,

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
despite such titanic efforts

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
on the path of open exchange of information,

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
there are still barriers.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Managers are far from always ready

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
to delve into the problems of employees,

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
and the employees themselves do not burn with a desire

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
to tell about them voluntarily.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Innovation companies

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
strive for information

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
to reach top managers

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
in an undistorted form.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
For example,

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
the SPICUP program

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
allows employees to regularly send anonymous letters

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
or emails to managers,

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
knowing that their messages

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
will not be ignored.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Horizontal communications

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
are an exchange of messages

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
between colleagues at work,

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
both within the organization

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
and between them.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
As a rule,

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
horizontal communications

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
not only pursue the goal

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
of informing someone about something,

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
but also ask for coordination of actions.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Horizontal communications

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
are divided into three categories.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
The first one

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
is the solution of problems within departments.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Such messages, as a rule,

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
are associated with the execution of tasks.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
For example,

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Svetlana,

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
can you help us fill in the list

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
of representative expenses?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
The second type of message

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
is coordination of work in departments.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
These are messages

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
that departments exchange

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
to fulfill

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
joint projects or common tasks.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
For example,

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Ivan, please contact the marketing and production department

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
and arrange a meeting.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
We need to discuss some issues.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
The next category of messages

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
is initiatives of changes and improvements.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Such messages

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
are exchanged by teams and departments

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
in an attempt to change,

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
improve or develop the organization.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
For example,

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
we are simplifying the system of appointment making

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
and would like to make it easier

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
to discuss innovations

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
with your department.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Horizontal communications

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
are especially important

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
in an educational organization

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
where teams of workers

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
are constantly solving problems

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
and looking for new ways of cooperation,

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
looking for new ways of working.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Remember the module

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
on building organizational structures.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
In order to improve

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
the coordination of types of activities,

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
many organizations

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
actively use horizontal communications,

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
which are used by special groups,

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
committees and even matrix structures.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
A special type of horizontal communications

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
is communication in teams.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Teams have become the bricks

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
from which many modern organizations

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
are built.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Team members

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
jointly work on the fulfillment

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
of the same tasks.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
The results obtained

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
and the degree of satisfaction

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
from the work

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
depend on the communication structure.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
In some cases,

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
the team members

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
work on the fulfillment

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
of tasks side by side

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
and which are characterized

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
by coordination of activities.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Such a model of interaction

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
leads to the emergence

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
of a decentralized communication network

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
in which all members of the group

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
carry out direct communications

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
with each other

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
and freely exchange information.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
Sometimes such a group,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
such a structure

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
is called a general channel

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
or a communication network

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
of the type of a star.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
It works best

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
in the case of complex

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
and non-standard tasks.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Such a structure, as a rule,

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
leads to a high level

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
of satisfaction of the group members.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
The second scheme of organization

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
of work is a joint working group,

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
members of which

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
work on the fulfillment

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
of tasks independently,

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
although they are connected

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
to each other.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
The tasks that are to be performed

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
are divided between the group members,

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
who then work individually on one.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Coordination of activities

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
of each member is carried out,

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
and the results are combined

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
in the central control point.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
The information flows

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
to the central figure,

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
and then is distributed

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
between the members of the group.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
Sometimes such a structure

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
is called an information network

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
built on the type of a wheel or a chain.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
This is a situation

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
when a task is easily standardized

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
or divided into parts.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
In such groups,

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
satisfaction is usually characteristic

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
for a person who occupies

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
the wheel's axis.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
In the end, it is he

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
who participates in all aspects

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
of the group processing of information.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
The opposing groups

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
are characterized

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
by the existence of subgroups

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
experiencing discrepancy

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
in some aspects

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
of production activities.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
The reasons for the discrepancy

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
between subgroups

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
may be specific issues,

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
for example, short-term disputes

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
about the best ways

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
to achieve goals.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Sometimes the discrepancies

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
are long-term,

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
for example, in disputes

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
about production management.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
As expected,

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
communication between groups

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
is often limited and distorted.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
The difficulties of solving

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
simple problems

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
in centralized communication networks

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
have shown their high productivity.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Members of such teams

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
could simply pass information

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
to the leader who made the decision.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Decentralized networks

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
are more slow

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
in solving simple tasks

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
because the information

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
goes around all its members

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
until someone finally

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
puts all the parts together

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
and makes a final decision.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
The more problems there are,

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
the faster the decentralized networks work.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Because the information

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
is concentrated not in one person,

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
but circulates during

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
intensive communication,

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
and each member of the team

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
has the opportunity to actively participate

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
in making decisions.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
The accuracy of the decision changes

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
along with the level of difficulty of the problems.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Centralized networks

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
make fewer mistakes

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
in simple tasks,

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
but become less effective

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
in solving complex problems.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
In this way,

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
it is fair to conclude

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
that in conditions of

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
tough global competition,

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
teams are used

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
to solve complex problems.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
If the task set

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
before the team

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
is really difficult,

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
all its members

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
should have access to information,

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
i.e. a decentralized structure

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
in which the information

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
and communication

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
that fulfills routine tasks

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
spend much less time

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
on processing the information,

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
which means that a more adequate

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
centralized structure is presented.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
This organization assumes

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
that the data is sent

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
to the leader

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
who makes the decisions,

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
and the members

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
have free time

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
to perform ordinary tasks.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Informal communication channels

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
are not connected

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
with legalized formal channels

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
but are connected

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
with the structure of the organization.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Informal communication

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
coexists with formal communication,

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
but does not depend on the hierarchy level

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
and connects all employees in the organization.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
As a rule,

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
there are two types of informal channels

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
in organizations

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
– walking management

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
and secret telegraph.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Walking management,

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
based on the exits to the people,

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
became widely known

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
thanks to the popular bestseller

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
about the leaders

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
who prefer to receive information

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
about the company's activities

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
directly from conversations

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
with employees.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
This method of communication

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
can be used by managers of all levels.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
For example,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
the president of the company ARCA

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
had a habit of visiting

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
the regional department of the company,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and instead of appointing

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
an official meeting

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
with the director of the department,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
he came incognito

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and was not able to meet

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
the director of the department.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
In the case of walking management,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
it helps to strengthen

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
both rising and falling communications.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Managers have the opportunity

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
to convey their ideas and values

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
to employees

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and hear about the problems

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
of worrying employees.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
A manager unable to manage

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
the walking management

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
feels his alienation,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
some kind of detachment

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and isolation from his subordinates.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
The secret telegraph

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
exists always and everywhere.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
If the formal channels of communication

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
in organizations are closed,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
it acquires the character

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
of a dominating principle of communication.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
But in this case,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
it is undoubtedly useful

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
because information is spread

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
through it,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
which contributes

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
to a more adequate perception of the situation.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Rumors allow employees

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
to fill the information vacuum

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and to be able to

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
clarify various decisions of management.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The telegraph is activated

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
when there are changes in the company,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
when there is anxiety

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
or when the economic situation is worsening.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Studies show

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
that the effectiveness of the secret telegraph

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
depends primarily

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
on several people.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Slide 27 presents

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
two of its most common schemes.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
In a simple chain,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
one person reports

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
any new information

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
to many others,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
and in a cluster chain

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
information is transmitted

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
by several individuals.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The smaller the number of transfer links,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
the more accurate the information.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
With their increase,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
the secret telegraph

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
turns into a spoiled phone.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
What is surprising is that

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
the information transmitted

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
by the secret telegraph

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
differs in reliability

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
and is usually dedicated

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
to organizational problems.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
The information transmitted

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
is somehow connected

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
with the business

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and has nothing in common with the rumors.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Moreover,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
up to 90% of the data is confirmed.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Many managers

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
are negatively related to the secret telegraph

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and would be happy to get rid of it.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
However, it should be borne in mind

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
that almost 5 out of 6

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
important messages

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
are distributed to some extent

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
by means of the secret telegraph

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
via official channels.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
A survey of 22,000 shift workers

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
from various industries

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
showed that

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
55% of them

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
receive the bulk of information

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
through the secret telegraph.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
The most remote managers

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
are well versed

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
in the subtleties

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
of this means of communication.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
They know who is connected with whom

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
and who of the workers

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
plays a leading role

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
in the informal distribution

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
of information.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
In all cases,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
especially in crisis moments,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
it is necessary to manage communications

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
wisely so that the secret telegraph

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
does not become the only source of information.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Communication barriers of the organization

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Although communication in organizations

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
often has an interpersonal nature,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
however,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
not always the problems of their organization

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
are exhausted by interpersonal barriers.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Often,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
on the path of effective communication

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
and, accordingly,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
on the path of successful work of the organization

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
there are specific barriers

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
associated with various problems

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
of the organization as a whole.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
These organizational barriers

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
in communications

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
deserve special attention

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
because their nature

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
is not associated with the specifics

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
of the individual or group behavior of people,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
but with the problems of the organization itself.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
When information moves

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
up and down inside the organization,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
the meaning of the message

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
can be distorted.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
This can be due to a number of reasons.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Messages can be distorted

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
unintentionally due to difficulties

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
in interpersonal contacts.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
However, other factors

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
play a significant role

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
in the appearance of distortions.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Firstly,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
it is possible that the information

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
is deliberately distorted by the source.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Such distortion can take place,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
for example,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
when the message serves

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
to assess the activity of the source

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
and it is modified

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
in accordance with the needs

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
of the source.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Secondly,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
another important problem

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
is associated with the so-called

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
filtering of information.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Filtering is a process

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
of losing part of the message

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
due to inevitable losses

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
of any nature

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
when moving up or down

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
the levels of the management hierarchy

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
or within one level of the organization

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
from one employee

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
to another employee.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The loss of a message

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
when moving up

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
the levels of the management hierarchy,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
when selecting information,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
when distributing it

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
among different recipients,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
when purposefully

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
cutting off the information

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
from the general management

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
and simplifying the message

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
in the event of the transmission

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
of specific instructions to the subordinates.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The managers who transmit the message

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
and determine what to transmit

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
come from the desire

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
to overcome all possible obstacles

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
in interpersonal contacts

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
from their own assessment

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
of the importance and utility

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
of a particular piece of information.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
This moment pushes them

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
to filter them

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
and to emphasize other messages.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Such selection may be the reason

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
for not getting important information

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
to another sector of the organization

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
or for getting information

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
with a significant distortion of meaning.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
For example,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
one study showed

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
that only 63% of the information

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
sent by the Board of Directors

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
reached the Vice-Presidents,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
40% reached the managers

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and only 20% reached the employees.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
There may be other reasons

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
for filtering the information.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
For example,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
messages sent up

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
the levels of the management hierarchy

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
may be distorted

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
due to the tendency

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
to provide the management

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
with the opportunity

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
to receive only positive information.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
This may lead to the fact

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
that the subordinate

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
does not inform the manager

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
about a potential or existing problem

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
because he does not want to

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
tell the boss bad news.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Since the subordinates often want

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
to receive approval from the manager,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
they can only tell him

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
what he wants to hear.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Studies show

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
that such status differences

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
are strongly reflected

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
in the way

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
the management

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
communicates the information.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Among other reasons

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
that prevent the employees

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
from conveying the information

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
may be fear of punishment

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and a sense of uselessness of their work.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Another important reason

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
why the content of the message

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
may not reach the recipient

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
is overloading the recipient

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
with other incoming messages

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
or his discontent

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
with the subject of the message.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
The message

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
may not reach the recipient.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Organizations with complex

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
multi-level structures

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
may face other problems.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
The organizations' subordinates

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
are themselves organizations

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and, consequently,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
they inevitably have their own goals.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Therefore, if the organization's structure

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and motivation system

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
are built in a bad way,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
the subordinates' goals

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
may contradict

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
the organization's common goals

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
and the organization's goals.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
The higher the level of the organization's structure,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
the greater the probability

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
of significant contradictions.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
To overcome the obstacles

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
both in verbal and in written communication,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
the 5C communication system

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
has been adopted.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
First of all,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
clarity.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
The message and information

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
should be as clear

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
as possible.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Often insufficient clarity

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
is caused by an attempt

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
to express too many thoughts

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
with one sentence.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The second is completeness.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Simplification of information

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
may lead to its incompleteness.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Some information

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
may be more harmful

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
than its complete absence.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The next is correctness.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
In the case of long,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
unconnected messages,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the problem is rarely associated

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
with the excess of the topic.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Much more often,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
the problem is with the specific message

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
that the person wants to convey.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The next is concreteness.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Usually, communicators resort

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
to abstractions and generalizations

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
when they are not at all suitable

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
for real, concrete facts.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Abstraction is, of course,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
a value when we deal

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
with abstract things.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
However, we waste precious time

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
and abilities

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
when we squeeze real things

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
into abstract or non-concrete formulations.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The choice of a specific terminology

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
becomes more and more important

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
as the business is globalized.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
A term used in one culture

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
may have a completely opposite meaning

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
in another.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And finally, the last is correctness.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
It is completely useless

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
to use communication techniques

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
without any fault

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
if the message you send is incorrect.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Management should create

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
such an organizational structure

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
that will stimulate

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
positive and effective communication,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
which requires both individual skills

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and organizational actions.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
First,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
the atmosphere of trust and openness

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
in the organization

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
encourages employees

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
to have honest communication with each other.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Then employees painlessly

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
convey both good

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
and bad news.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
To create such an atmosphere of trust

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and dialogue,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
it is necessary to make an effort

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
to develop interpersonal

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
quality of the employees.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Secondly, managers must

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
have formal communication channels

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
in all areas.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Thirdly, managers must

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
stimulate simultaneous use

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
of multiple communication channels

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
both formal and informal.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The number of such multiple channels

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
includes written directives,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
face-to-face discussions,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
public appearances and secret telegraph.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
For example, at General Motors factories

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
a newspaper is published every month.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Managers regularly hold meetings

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
with the company's employees

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
to transmit news

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and to use electronic displays

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
in the cafeteria.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Sending messages

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
through multiple channels

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
simultaneously increases the chances

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
that they will be received

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
and correctly understood.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Fourthly, the organization's structure

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
must meet the needs of communication.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
If the organization has a shortage

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
of horizontal communication channels,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and teams can be created in it,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
specialized groups,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
managers' positions

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
and matrix structures

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
must be introduced.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
The organization's structure

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
must reflect the needs

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
of the information.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
If a department or team

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
performs complex,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
non-standard tasks,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
a decentralized structure

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
is necessary,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
which allows to intensify discussions

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and involve employees

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
in the management process.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Overcoming organizational

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
and communication barriers

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
is essential for the organization

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
to have a high-quality

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and highly efficient

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
communication technology.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Communication and a high-quality

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
workplace

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Progress in information technology

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
allows organizations

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
to distribute information

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
faster than before,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
to have more access

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
to the volume of information,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
to have a more efficient

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and reliable system

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
to have a wider

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
and direct access

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
to this information,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
to encourage participation

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
in the exchange of information

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and its use,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
to integrate systems and functions,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and to use information

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
for communication

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
with the environment

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
without any precedent.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Negative sides

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
of electronic communication

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
must be realized.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
First, these technologies

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
should interact with machines,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
not with each other.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Electronics also eliminates

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
the non-verbal component

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
of communication,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
which can add additional context

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
to the situation.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Some people, for example,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
say that sending an e-mail

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
is much easier to be harsh,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
overly critical and insensitive

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
than in personal contact.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
In this sense,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
using computer communication

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
can make people less restrained

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
and more impatient

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
in their statements.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Another danger of new

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
communication technologies

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
is information overload.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Individual users

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
may have difficulties

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
sorting useful and empty information.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
For example,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
giant IT company Intel

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
has problems with e-mail.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Employees of the company

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
are forced to process

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
more than 3 million e-mails a day.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
The messages

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
on a certain topic

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
are scattered

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
in the inboxes.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Important documents

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
are often freely circulated

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
on corporate networks,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
sometimes even in several copies.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Your cooperation with colleagues

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
can be more fruitful

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and the company's activities

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
more successful

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
if you use one of the network

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
means of group work,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
which provide the opportunity

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
to access information

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
from any point in the world

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
where there is an Internet access.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
For example,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
the development of Russian programmers

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
and the operating system of the Motiv company

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
allow you to participate in the life of your company

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
by being in any point of the globe.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It allows you to control

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
the rising and descending

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
horizontal information streams,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
to group information

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
according to the characteristic

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
convenient for the user,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
to automatically generate

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
the information

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
about the activity of the employees.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
All information about the course of the project,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
the tasks and assignments

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
is stored in the database

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
and is available at any time

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
for work or acquaintance.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
The Motiv system

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
allows you to work

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
on common projects

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
of partners, clients, and agents,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
creating a single information space

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
between the participants

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
of the communication process.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
There are many questions

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
about the role of communication

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
in the context of modern organizations.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
The interest in studying

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
the female and male communication styles

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
is not diminished.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
It is believed that men and women

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
are taught and socialized

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
in different ways,

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
as a result of which

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
they often experience difficulties

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
in communicating with each other.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Women in communication

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
are focused on building relationships,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
while men try to

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
surround them with individuals

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
whose communication style

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
is suitable for their own.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
The conclusion is that

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
in the process of communication

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
either women or men

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
will dominate

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
depending on who

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
will be in the majority

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
in a particular situation.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Do women have better

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
communication skills

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
compared to men?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The survey showed

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
that in terms of communication skills,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
the women have a higher ability

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
to find and meet,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
to give an assessment,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
and to delegate powers to others.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
The leadership evaluates

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
women managers

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
higher than their male colleagues.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
The subordinates also evaluated

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
these abilities in women managers

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
higher than in men.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
These results can be explained

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
by the fact that early socialization

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
and education

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
improve women's

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
communication skills

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
and, on the contrary,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
men can socialize in such a way

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that it inevitably creates

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
communication problems,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
aggression and spirit of rivalry.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Taking this opportunity into account,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
it is very important to avoid

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
gender stereotypes

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and focus your attention

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
on the exclusively important question

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
of how to maximize

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
the effectiveness of communication

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
in organizations.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Today, many contradictions

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
in organizational communications

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
are being raised.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
One example is the control

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
by employers

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
over e-mails

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
that employees send

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
from their workplace.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
The study conducted

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
by the American Association of Management

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
found that the electronic control

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
over the employee's activity

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
increases by 45% per year.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
You may be surprised

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
that most often

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
bosses monitor the phone numbers

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
of the employees

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
and how long

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
they talk on the phone.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Then they monitor e-mails

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
27% of all cases,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
computer files 21%

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
and the content

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
of phone conversations.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
The question of keeping secrets

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
remains controversial

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
because the continuous development

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
of communication technologies

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
makes it easier for employers

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
to introduce electronic monitoring

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
over how employees perform

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
their work

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
and carry out their communications.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Our society is fighting

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
for political correctness

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
of communication at work.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
The working dictionary is changing

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
and people are thinking more

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
about not offending

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
another person or a group of people.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Today we use such terms

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
as people with physical disabilities

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
or people of older age.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Not so long ago

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
these groups of people

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
were called differently

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
and their names

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
may change in the future.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Organizations even organize

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
special trainings

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
for their employees

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
to help them eliminate

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
all shades of intolerance

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
or inattention from the communication process.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Open communication

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
involves the exchange of information

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
of all types

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
between all structural

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
divisions of the organization

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and hierarchical levels.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Many companies

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
open their financial documents

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
and make them available

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
to all levels of employees

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
so that employees understand

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
how and why the company

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
works as it does.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Open communication

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
contradicts the traditional

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
downward trend

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
when the management

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
sends the subordinates

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
incomplete information.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Getting rid of the usual

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and functional divisions

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
of these potential

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
communication barriers

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
the organization gets the opportunity

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
to use the ideas

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
of all its employees.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
When the idea is circulated

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
only in a narrow circle of managers

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
there is no effective training

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
or changes in the organization.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
There is no formation

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
of a network of relationships

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
thanks to which companies

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
thrive in modern conditions.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Attracting more people

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
and a wider range of opinions

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
is beneficial for organizational communication.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
In addition,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
open communication

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
contributes to the appearance

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
of trust and commitment

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
to common goals.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
This is extremely important

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
for organizations whose activities

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
are associated with cooperation

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
and knowledge exchange.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Dialogue is a group

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
communication process

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
whose participants form

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
a content stream of information

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
and share their worldview.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Initially,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
the participants of the dialogue

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
can provide a complete

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
opposite to each other,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
but through open discussion

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
they find common ideals,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
common themes,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
common goals.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
It is easiest to describe

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
the concept of dialogue

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
by comparing it with a discussion.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
The differences between the two

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
are presented on slide 31.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
The task of the discussion

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
is to express

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
one's point of view

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
and convince others to accept it.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
The rule of the discussion

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
and its logic

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
is to break the resistance

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
of the opposing side.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
In dialogue, on the contrary,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
the participants want

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
to express their opinion

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
and offer to speak

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
on the other side

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
on this topic.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
This allows to achieve

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
a more complete understanding

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
of the new ideas.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
The goal of dialogue

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
is to understand each other's point of view

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
and find points of contact.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Both forms of communication

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
and discussion and dialogue

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
can lead to changes,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
but the result of the discussion

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
is limited by the frameworks

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
of the discussed topic,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
and the result of the dialogue

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
is characterized by unity of opinions,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
common content

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
and change of worldview.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
As the more deep

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
the decisions between the participants

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
of the dialogue,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
the more trustful

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
and closer relations develop,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
which naturally contributes

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
to the quality of communication.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And finally, the final section,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
which needs to be discussed

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
in more detail,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
is feedback and training.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Feedback to the subordinate

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
is the voice of the reaction

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
to certain of his actions,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and this is necessary

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
for several reasons.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
First,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
this is a simple expression of attention,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
which, as various studies show,

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
often has a beneficial effect

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
on the relationship

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
between people working together.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Secondly,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
timely feedback

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
allows to perform preventive work

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
on the employee's mistakes.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Thirdly, feedback

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
has a motivating function.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
It allows the employee

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
to find out what is expected of him

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
and what are the criteria for assessment

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
of his work.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And most importantly,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
feedback allows to achieve

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
the desired results from the employee.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Feedback shows the employee

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
how his work is evaluated.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Therefore, as feedback,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
various instruments of stimulation

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
such as indirect assessment tools

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
can be considered.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Such indirect tools include

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
gratitude or reproach,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
reward or depression,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
increase or decrease

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
of the employee's work,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and service improvement.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
All these tools show

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
whether the employee is evaluated

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
well or badly.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
However, sometimes it is difficult

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
for the employee to figure out

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
what exactly he was encouraged

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
or punished for.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Therefore, feedback is effective

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
only when the supervisor

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
explains in detail

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
what is good in his work

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
and what is not very good.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Therefore, the most effective

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
feedback tool

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
is the one provided by the employee

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
when the employee not only

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
learns about the assessment of his work,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
but also has the opportunity

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
to ask questions

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
and clarify incomprehensible points.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
There are various situations

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
in the work life

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
when the use of feedback

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
is not only appropriate,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
but also necessary.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Feedback is related to such types of feedback

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
as assessment of the current

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
activity of the employee,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
feedback on the employee's proposals,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
and feedback on the attitude

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
of the employee

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
to the company.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
The purpose of feedback

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
on the current activity

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
is to evaluate the employee's work,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
to show what is done well

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
and what should be done in the future,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
to identify shortcomings

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
and discuss ways to correct them.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
In addition, it is important

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
to show the employee

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
the importance of his work for the company,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
that is, to motivate him.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
The main rule is that

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
feedback should be based on facts.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Feedback should not be converted

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
into a compliment or praise of the employee,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
that is,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
a compliment or a compliment

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
of the employee's work.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Feedback should ideally

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
include highlighting

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
the strengths of the employee's work,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
the behavior of the employee,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
and the weaknesses,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
that is, the places that require correction.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Studies show

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
that when analyzing the behavior

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
of other people,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
we underestimate the influence

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
of a person's nature

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
and his personal abilities,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
and underestimate the influence

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
of specific circumstances

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
that affect

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
a particular activity.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
For example,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
the reason for the employee's

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
non-productive work

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
is most likely due to the lack

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
of personal abilities of the employee,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
not due to the situation

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
at his workplace.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
This phenomenon is called

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
a non-productive work.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
That is why it is very important

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
to evaluate the employee,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
to talk to him,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
to clarify the situation

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
in which he was

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
and what influenced

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
the result they presented.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
This approach will help

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
to avoid mistakes

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
when evaluating the employee's work

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
and be objective.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Feedback on the employee's proposals

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
is intended to support the initiative,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
to increase motivation,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
and to promote the employee's work.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
If you are collecting the employee's proposals,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
you need to give feedback

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
on all of them

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
and take any action

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
to show the employees

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
that the situation will change

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
or explain why the proposal

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
is not accepted

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
and the situation does not change.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Conversations with feedback

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
are made as the proposals

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
are received from the employees.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
When preparing for such a conversation,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
the supervisor

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
should study the employee's proposal,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
the written document

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
or the conversation that took place,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
assess its relevance

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
or novelty in the first approach,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
its timing,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
its necessity,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
make a decision

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
and prepare arguments

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
for refusal or vice versa,

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
give the employee the approval

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
and determine what further work is required.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
If the employee himself

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
does not say something,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
then you need to ask the guiding questions.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000
It is important that the employee

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
speaks out all the above rules himself.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Then he will be more realistic

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
and critical

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
about his proposal.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Feedback on the employee's proposals

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
should be presented as follows.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
First, what is interesting,

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
what did the employee come up with

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
and what is interesting

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
the employee proposed.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Second,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
what and where can be improved.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Third,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
set the points of relevance,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
feasibility,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
adequacy of the proposed proposals.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
The fourth step

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
is to make a general verdict

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
whether it is accepted or not,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
whether it is accepted now

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
or after a certain period of time.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And the last step

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
is to agree on the following actions

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
that the employee should take

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
in connection with his proposal.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Feedback on the employee's plans

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
is provided by the supervisor

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
with such a periodicity

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
that the plans themselves are prepared.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Weekly plans,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
for example,

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
for sales managers

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
are better discussed every week

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
for 5 or 10 minutes

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
to control the motivation

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
of prioritization.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
And monthly plans

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
are discussed every month.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
The structure of the meeting

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
on the discussion and approval of the plan

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
may have different consequences.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
In the first case,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
if everything is not in line with the plan,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
the employee needs to be informed

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
and if he has questions

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
or needs to discuss something important,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
he needs to be helped.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
If the provided plan

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
requires adjustments,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
the supervisor must decide

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
what is in line with the plan

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
and can be left,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
what is not in line with the plan

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
and needs to be changed.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And the supervisor

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
must decide

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
what needs to be improved.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Then the supervisor

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
must initiate a discussion

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
on the issues

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
that the employee has difficulties with

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
or give information sources,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
give the employee a certain course of thought

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
and finally agree on the terms

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
of the provision of the revised plan.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Feedback on the employee's reports

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
The minimum that can be done

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
is to inform the employee

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
that the report was successfully accepted

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
and note the most important

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
merits and achievements of the employee.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
If the report requires

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
some kind of adjustment,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
feedback on the employee's report

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
can be given

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
according to the following scheme.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
The first thing to do

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
is that the supervisor

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
must tell the employee

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
what he is satisfied with

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
in the work done during the reporting period,

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
what was done well.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Then the supervisor

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
tells the employee

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
what he is not satisfied with

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
in the work done during the reporting period,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
what were the goals,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
what indicators were not achieved,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
in which tasks the priorities were set incorrectly,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
where the deadlines were broken,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
where the quality of the work was not satisfactory,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
and so on.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
The supervisor must also discuss

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
with the employee

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
the reason why he did not complete

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
a particular task,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
what helps and what prevents

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
the employee from solving the tasks set.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
How will he fix the situation?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
How to achieve the goals set?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
And the last thing

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
is that the supervisor sets priorities

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
in solving the tasks

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
and mistakes of the employee.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
After providing the primary feedback

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
on the supervisor's plans and reports,

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
the employee must take

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
a few more steps.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
The first thing is that the employee

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
corrects or complements the plan or report

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
taking into account the feedback from the supervisor.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
The second thing is that the supervisor

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
studies the corrected documents.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And the third thing is that the supervisor

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
provides the final feedback

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
on the attitude of the employee

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
to what is happening in the company,

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
on changes and innovations.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Its goal is to avoid

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
the misunderstanding of the staff

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
set by the tasks, strategies

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
and corporate values of the company.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Usually, in order to introduce

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
changes in the company,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
the employees are informed.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
That is, they say,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
for example,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
we decided to live in a new way.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
In order to introduce changes,

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
the employees are informed

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
and the company is informed.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
The most important thing

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
is to ask the employees

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
what they think about it,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
what are their concerns and objections.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
For these purposes,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
the survey is used,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
the method of box of proposals,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
personal conversations with the employee.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
As in the case of the employee's proposals,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
in no case can the employees

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
be left without attention

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
and concerns.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Thus, the feedback of the employees

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
should be contained in themselves.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
The first is the connection to the situation.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
That is, I understand

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
that the upcoming changes

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
will be quite difficult for us.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
This will bring a lot of new things

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
to our activity.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
The second is the praise of the employee

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
for certain concerns.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
It is very good that you noticed

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
that in this situation

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
certain aspects of our activity

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
will change

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
and we will have to do something.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And finally, the last thing

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
is the dissemination of myths.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
We should not answer

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
the objections of the well-known leaders.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
After all, as you know,

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
the root of all objections

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
is the lack of information.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
That is, we need to continue

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
this example

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
by answering the objections

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
that have come from employees.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
And in conclusion,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
let's add several rules

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
to the principles of feedback

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
that we have already discussed today.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
The first is that there should be feedback.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
It is not worth hoping

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
that the employee will simply

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
take into account the opinion of the leader

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
or the significant silence

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
that is required of him.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
The second is that feedback

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
should be timely.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
It is not worth discussing the situation

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
that happened a year ago.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Even when providing

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
negative feedback,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
you need to find something

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
to praise the employee for.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And you need to start

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
with the assessment of what is good

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
in his work.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And you need to prepare

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
for feedback.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
You should not expect

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
that everything will change

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
immediately after feedback.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Unfortunately, feedback

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
does not work like a magic wand.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Change is a long and difficult process.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Sometimes you need to repeat

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
the same thing many times.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
After all, the habit of doing something

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
in a certain way

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
only goes away over time

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
and with the correct reinforcement

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
of the desired result.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
And this is one of the most powerful

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
tools of staff management.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
If feedback is organized

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
correctly and systematically,

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
it allows you to achieve

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
a positive attitude to tasks,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
a positive attitude to work tasks,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
to comments on his address,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
to understanding and acceptance of criticism,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
as well as the readiness

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
to correct the shortcomings.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
The employee is ready

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
and striving to correct

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
his shortcomings

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
and to improve his performance.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Is this employee

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
not a dream of any manager?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
In conclusion,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I would like to say

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
that in the last survey

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
conducted by the American

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Association of Management,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
only 63% of respondents

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
gave a positive assessment

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
to their managers

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
on the indicator of bringing

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
information to the employees

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
and instructions.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
The surveyed employees

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
from another selection

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
assessed the ability of their managers

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
to listen and ask questions

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
only in 3.36 points

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
on a 5-point scale.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
It is obvious that in the field

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
of communication at work

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
and among managers

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
there is still a lot to do.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I wish you success in this

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
and I hope that our course

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
will help you in your organization's real work.
