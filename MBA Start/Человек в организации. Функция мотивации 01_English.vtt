WEBVTT

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.670
Dear colleagues, hello to you.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.850
My name is Olga Nikolaevna Zabria.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.950
I have been a HR Director

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.810
for over 11 years.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.030
I worked in 1989 personnel.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.810
In fact, I came into business immediately

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.550
after it was announced that it was

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.850
possible to create private

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.770
enterprises in November 1988.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.230
I can say that I have been working

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.870
in private business from the beginning.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.590
And everything we will discuss today

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.510
is very close to me and as practice

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.450
very important.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.690
The topic of today’s conversation is the person

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.990
in the organization and the function

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.450
of motivation.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.030
The motivation process will start with you.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.610
This is just a base, because it is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.310
an endless topic that can be talked

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.990
about a lot.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.310
A topic that enjoys great interest

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.950
and attention from listeners

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.470
and managers.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.090
This is a topic that is constantly

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.750
discussed in any organization.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.610
So, let’s start with our first topic – the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070
person in the organization.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.250
People in the organization and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.790
the organizational environment.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.070
What is it?

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.790
You know well that everyone

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.330
at work, wherever they are,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.690
is in an organizational

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.470
environment.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.730
And that is about this environment we will

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.770
talk to you today.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.170
In any organization, of course, people

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.610
work, and, of course, the relationship

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.310
between people in the company

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.490
is very important.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.370
This is carried out through the

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.470
structure, through the corporate

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.090
culture that exists, is aware of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.710
its company or not, and also has

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.670
a very strong influence in the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.470
style of management, in the style

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.450
of leadership.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.350
The establishment of human-organizational

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.390
interaction, mutual expectation.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.330
Again, the human organization is what the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.550
human person expects from the organization

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.310
and what the organization expects from us,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.330
from those who came there to work.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.070
The gap between the requirements

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.550
for a person occupying a certain

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.370
position or position and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.550
his potential, actual efficiency.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.270
We come into the organization

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.550
and expect something.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.370
When we are employed, the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.310
organization naturally relies

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.630
on some of our strong

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.470
points.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.430
Whether they match or not.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.010
Careful selection of personnel is,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.990
of course, also a very important issue.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.930
And from here it depends, it directly

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.090
follows the previous in our expectations.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.050
It either coincided or did not coincide.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.010
I am a member of this organization, it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.730
is my company or not mine.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.310
Hiring, mentoring, instruction,

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.590
leadership are such important things

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.030
for any employee who has

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.910
just come to the company.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.090
We will discuss the values with you.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.110
Influence of informal groups, distribution

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.690
of roles and, finally, the theme

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.170
of endless motivation.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.570
But we begin with the theme of “man

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.190
in the organization”, “man and the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.530
organizational environment”.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.910
What is Organization?

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.230
It is the unification

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.310
of people to a goal.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.370
What are the signs of the organization?

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.430
Every organization has a goal.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.590
What types of organizations exist?

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.690
Well, let’s start with the fact

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.350
that we are already born into a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.270
certain organization called “Roddom.”

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.950
Next - kindergarten, school, pioneering

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.790
organization, institute, university.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.630
Take the Moscow State

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.890
University.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.890
It is an old-famous organization

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.830
with its own rules, its

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.970
own culture, its world fame.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.890
Organizations such as a football

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.870
team, yes, it is also an organization

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.270
with its structure and

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.290
culture.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.470
Naturally, with its members

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.330
of the organization, with its

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.410
various groups, formal

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.070
or informal leaders.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.390
In any organization there is a structure

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.470
and culture.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.750
The structure of the organization can

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.370
be completely different, because

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.950
it depends on the type of

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.830
activity that the company carries out.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.590
And, of course, the existence of

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.010
a connection between the members of the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.550
organization and certain rules that

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.070
exist in the organization,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.890
one organization differs from the other.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.910
Continuous interactions with

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.390
the environment are those external

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.210
factors that affect any organization.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.490
There is also the availability

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.230
of resources, i.e. motivation,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.110
internal motivation in each

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.190
existing organization.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.410
The organizational structure.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.310
What is it?

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.110
Let us think, remember, each of

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.490
you works in a company,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.750
in an organization that has its

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.110
own, only its inherent, unique

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.650
structure.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.970
Although it can be said that,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.150
in principle, all organizations

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.770
are built absolutely the same.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.190
There is a board or general manager,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.190
or the owner of the company, there are

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.490
managers of the first, second, third

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.450
level, there are employees performing

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.210
certain functions, there are departments,

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.830
subdivisions.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.410
But the organizational structure

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.550
in any company determines the inter-

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.590
subordination between different

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.710
functions, non-positions,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.350
precisely the functions performed

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.470
by employees of a particular

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.550
organization.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.210
The principle of division of labor is who,

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.650
what and how.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.310
Organizations are divided into three main

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.770
types.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.750
The first is functional organization.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.010
This is production, sale or sale,

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.730
finance, procurement, marketing and

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.410
other functions.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.090
Product production is the production

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.790
of any products, for example,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.790
the production of pipes, the production

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.030
of by-products for the population,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.690
for example, the tea boilers,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.650
pots, beds, anything that can

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.970
accompany the production of pipes.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.230
and matrix organization.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.890
Recently, such organizations

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.590
are becoming more and more fashionable,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.650
popular and necessary.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.010
This mode was mainly introduced

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.370
by IT companies because it is there

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.670
that there are experts in functional

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.510
departments that are attached

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.030
to or several product divisions.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.350
Every structure involves a

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.770
hierarchy.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.130
I think you all know that there

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.750
is hierarchy in any company.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.430
And, in fact, there are managers

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.530
of the upper, middle, supervisors,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.270
various services, different

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.550
between the upper and lower.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.850
For many it seems that the greater the

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.530
distance between the higher and lower

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.430
link, the cooler the higher link,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.110
because they become unbelievable

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.230
and inaccessible.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.110
I can say that in the 200 years of

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.550
capitalism’s existence in the West,

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.630
they have gone through all stages.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.390
From very deep structures to

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.090
rather small structures at their levels.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.310
We are following them in seven-mile steps

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.530
and we must pay tribute to the wisdom

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.090
of our leaders that they were not fascinated

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.170
by the great depth of structures.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.490
Since business was allowed private since

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.110
1988, and it has been active since

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.370
1889, companies were created, in

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.970
general, very small.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.470
There was a manager, a owner, there

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.990
were some trusted persons, second level

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.830
and there were employees.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.570
Total of three levels.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.530
Only three.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.970
If we look at the example of

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.610
a Western company, such as

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.570
General Motors, in the 1980s,

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.350
the hierarchy of this company

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.090
was 22 levels.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.710
That is, from the board of directors

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.490
to the most ordinary worker who stood on

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.430
the conveyor and mounted the machines,

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.530
there were 22 levels of hierarchy.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.270
From the perspective of staff

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.090
and career growth, this is great.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.290
There is a huge high road

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.610
that can be overcome, in

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.690
principle, any American dream.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.630
But it turned out that it was not so

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.010
good for the economy and for the business

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:17.910
of the company.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.550
In 1980, General Motors decided

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.150
that 22 levels were too

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.390
much.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.510
Too much to manage, too much

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.970
to budget, because the higher

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.870
the management, the higher

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.490
the salary.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.230
Therefore, it was decided to remove the

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.010
excess levels, a huge analytical

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.330
work was carried out and as a result

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.670
they came to the hierarchy 6.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.570
That is, from the highest level, this

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.570
board of directors to the lowest,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.990
there were only 6 levels.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.110
It is clear that the career ladder

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.570
has dropped sharply and moving

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.530
from one stage to another turns

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.230
out to take much more time.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.970
From this point of view, of course, a

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.310
great inconvenience, but from the point

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.130
of view of managable, from the point

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.450
of view of business, from the point

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.930
of view of correctness of investing money,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.790
it was, of course, a very correct and

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.190
wise decision.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.970
They were pioneers in the restructuring

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.370
and reorganization of the company.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.370
Now I will show you a small example.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.750
It is taken from an existing very

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.230
large IT company, Western Nenasha.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.990
Here, in the table.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.010
Please look to the left where the

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.390
name of the manager and the number

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.790
of the company, you will see all

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.890
the parameters that go for special

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.930
calculation.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.670
Take for example Eugene Tishchenko.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.390
He is the owner or CEO

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.930
of a Level 1 company.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.050
There are 128 people, a small number.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.490
Let us look at this number

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.830
of companies.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.350
The level of managers in the

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.390
organization 6.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.370
What does it mean?

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.650
In total, there are 19 managers in

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.830
the company.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.970
If we divide 128 by 19, we have

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.430
some errors, if we round, companies

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.470
use different types of overview

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.190
to understand how correct

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.970
or wrong they have calculated

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.610
the level of their hierarchy.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.990


00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.330
In the West, this is called

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.130
the Organizational Health Index.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.270
The organization’s health index.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.370
Look how interesting it sounds.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.370
Health, that is, healthy

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.030
management, correct,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.670
literate, true.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.230
There are various options

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.450
for calculating such indices.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.410
Each company hired consultants,

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.470
and they made surveys,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.330
reviews for this company.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.470
These surveys are conducted

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.650
once a year, preferably three

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.450
years in a row using the

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.530
same survey, for all companies

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.010
in the world owned by the

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.030
corporation.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.270
And the index of managable of a representation

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.970
and companies at the global

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.850
level as a whole is calculated.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.990
What is interesting can be seen

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.030
in this table.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.990
For example, this organizational

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.570
index at the management level

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.850
shows, and this is included

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.890
in the survey, how much staff

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.090
trust them.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.070
This is a very important moment.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.830
I don’t think our business is

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.490
ready for this today, although

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.290
I know that many advanced companies

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.930
are increasingly inclined

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.590
to such reviews because they

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.370
are really interesting.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.030
Are they properly equipped with

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.150
managerial staff?

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.450
The right people run the company.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.190
Do they trust staff?

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.890
Because it is on trust that

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.930
efficiency is built.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.950
The effectiveness of people, their performance,

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.350
their involvement, in many companies in

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.630
the West, there are their different

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.030
parameters.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.770
Here, the company that is presented

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.070
here, I will not just name it,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.930
but they thought that if the

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.770
index is below 74, it is worth

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.530
thinking about whether the right

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.010
person is at the head of the entire

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.610
company or a particular department.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.750
So seriously they began to

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.210
take such things.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.560
This is part of the

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.780
company’s corporate culture.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.960
This is about corporate culture,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.200
we will talk to you and talk very

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.180
seriously, because when you are

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.140
chosen and you choose the

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.740
company you would like to work

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.860
for, the company of your dreams,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.700
the employer of your dreams,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.260
the question why you want to

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.360
work in a company, most

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.740
people will answer, I like it

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.860
because it has an image.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.200
Why such a positive image?

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.120
Because people are comfortable there.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.760
Because the culture of relationships

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.380
in the company is built in

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.660
such a way that the person wants

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.380
to work, to be effective, to be

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.560
the best, to succeed and

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.200
help the company, to succeed together

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.400
with themselves.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.440
Naturally, a company depends

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.300
on the people it employs, and

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.500
we depend on the companies we

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.480
go to work for.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.420
Therefore, when choosing a company,

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.620
the employer must be very

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.300
careful, very careful.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.760
And during the interview you are

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.860
asked questions, but you should also

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.420
ask about the company and ask deep

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.400
questions, including about

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.020
the corporate culture.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.280
So what is corporate culture?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:18.880
It is a system of values and methods

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.640
of decision-making that forms

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.460
the awareness of employees

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.620
belonging to a particular culture.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.960
How much banks differ in culture

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.540
from IT companies, pharmaceutical

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.680
companies, or large manufacturers

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.040
like Pepsi or Coca-

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.240
Cola.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.560
Everything is completely different.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.620
How much, let’s say, the companies

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.880
of oil and gas industry differ.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.440
There is absolutely its own

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.200
culture, created consciously or unconsciously

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.020
for years, decades, but it exists

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.160
in these companies.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.780
Every successful company

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.880
forms, it is forming, that is,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.720
not unconsciously, but already

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.700
consciously influences the culture

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.860
that is in the company, improves

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.520
it, brings some standards.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.680
The slide does not accidentally show the mother and

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.500
child.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.900
The corporate culture is the child

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.120
of any company.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.160
Every successful company

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.880
has its own unique

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.400
corporate culture.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.200
Each bank is different from the other

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.080
bank, precisely by its unique

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.540
corporate culture.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.280
In some bank you will be very comfortable,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.740
and you will want to work there

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.220
always, until retirement and as

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.460
long as possible.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.660
And from some bank, let’s say, you will

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.160
be ready to leave, even without

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.540
waiting for the end of

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.540
the trial period, because the trial

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.760
period is not only for the employee,

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.700
he and for the company.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.940
We choose and we are chosen.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.880
So, corporate culture is

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.540
the environment in which

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.860
every person, any of us,

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.860
in the organization he joins.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.520
What types of corporate cultures

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.960
or models, otherwise called interpersonal

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.540
relationships, exist?

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640
In advance of this topic, I will say

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.540
that to date in Russia there

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.960
are no other types of corporate culture

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.160
that are inherent in our Russian

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.360
companies.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.220
Well, if we remember that capitalism

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.740
is two hundred years old, and in our

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.440
country it began, roughly say, from

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:37.240
the 1990s and the company is

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.500
continuing to build, to structure.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.460
And this is of course very important,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.700
because the base that has been

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.300
created for decades, centuries

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.960
in the West, we take over,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.080
digest and create something of

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.020
our own.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.740
We look at all the best that

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.460
is in the West, throw away everything

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.200
that does not suit us, absorb

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.440
everything that we can

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.360
use for our business,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.180
for its efficiency.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.120
So, in order to know what we need

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.720
for our efficiency, let

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.580
us look at what they came to in

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.760
the West, what they developed

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.580
and how much it applies

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.820
to us.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:29.000
Those who founded the issue of developing

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.860
corporate culture types, such

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.580
as Charles Hendy, Jan Harms

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.440
or Harrison, are well known

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.640
in the West.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.020
Charles Hendy is a

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.760
very old man, very

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.680
old.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.440
His books are bestsellers on this

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.600
topic, they are really written

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.120
very informally, very fun about

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.180
the most serious things.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.580
The corporate culture.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.180
What types of corporate

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.360
culture exist?

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.140
To date, in Russia, the types of

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.580
corporate culture, purely our, Russian,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.800
have not been defined, because business

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.680
started with us, roughly speaking,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.920
17 years ago, from the 90s.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.660
So all I’ll talk about now

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.060
is Western experience.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.000
200 years of capitalism in the

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.780
West.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.660
We had a short break for 80

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.560
years, and now we are back

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.500
on the path we were on.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.720
In fact, we catch up using all

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.060
the best they have developed.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.660
All the mistakes that have been

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.100
made, we leave them, trying not

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.800
to do their very serious, but

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.280
at least to go ahead.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.220
So, in order to move forward, you

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.520
need to understand what you need

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.760
to push back from.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.680
What types of corporate culture exist?

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.820
The main developers of corporate

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.220
culture as concepts, as culture

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.900
itself, as influences on the life

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.260
of an organization, are Harrison,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.320
Hendy and Harms.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.580
The most famous of them is

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.080
the founder and HR, Human Resources,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.720
human resources, that is, serious

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.580
work with the staff

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.740
that takes place in companies.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.120
This is being used more

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.880
and more in Russia.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.780
He was also the founder

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.580
of the theory of corporate

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.220
culture, which he naturally

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.420
took from practical

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.180
examples from those companies

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.760
that existed in the market

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.700
he analyzed.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.160
There are four types of

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.360
corporate culture.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.180
What are they?

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.280
Type the first.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.100
The culture.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.140
Role of.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.620
The single power centre.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.380
The control.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.880
A corridor board or board of

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.700
directors or a college or

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.300
board, as you may call it,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.780
there are a lot of different options.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.300
This system of management is

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.220
combined with sufficient freedom in

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.480
the field.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.740
The corporate center manages the

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.820
divisions or branches not by operational

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.880
intervention, but through the creation

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.820
of uniform rules and standards.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.860
RAUES, Gazprom, the major networks of banks.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.220
More connected are large production

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.720
companies, where production

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.080
is distributed across different

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.320
regions.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.980
Western structures such as Microsoft,

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.180
Hewlett-Packard, such as Coca-

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.480
Cola and Samsung.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:25.840
Mass of others.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.400
These are the largest corporations that

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.080
through rules and standards

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.100
manage branches, division companies.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.360
Again, a lot of different names

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.020
of subsidiaries.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.680
Main mechanisms of management from the center.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.740
It is strategy.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.200
Yes, they are not giving it.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.380
Developing in place.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.720
and budgeting.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.960
What is wrong?

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.240
Lack of flexibility.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.800
If you feel that something needs

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.480
to be changed quickly, then there

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.380
will be more profit, more efficiency.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.380
It is extremely difficult

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.440
to do this in a short time,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.100
because the rules and standards

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.980
that exist, including

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.280
the way papers go.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.980
How long does it take to

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.160
make one or the other

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.560
decision?

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.480
These companies need a very

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.780
stable market.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.780
Very stable conditions.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.960
And of course, they have little creativity.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.180
But, in large numbers, in such

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.140
large companies to be creative is

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.340
very dangerous, because this

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.920
creativity can lead to large

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.120
financial losses.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.680
What are the criteria for such companies to succeed?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.620
This is a functional work.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.880
Functions, functions, that is, people and functions.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:43.820
The Communication.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.720
Communication is only written.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.220
This communication saves

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.700
in many situations.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.000
If you have written permission

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.780
or refusal, it is an indulgence for

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.320
you, it is protection during any checks

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.560
from the center, during any audits.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.660
Leaders, what is their primary function?

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.280
They monitor the execution of rules and

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.480
regulations, that is, those rules and

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.240
they control the processes of people

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.880
and they really let these people manifest

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.900
themselves.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.560
These companies are hierarchical.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.340
We have taken General Motors as

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.020
an example.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.660
22 hierarchy of the company depth and 6.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.600
These companies are not 6 in depth.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.320
It may not be 22, but it

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.860
may be 18, 15, 12, but not less.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.660
It is a really big hierarchy.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.200
Plus, there is a great career growth

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.640
here and it is absolutely understandable

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.100
to any person.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.420
The next type of culture.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.840
Culture of task or culture of achievement.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.140
The center of power is based

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.160
on competence, knowledge.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.880
These are basically not large

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.000
corporations, although to date,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.120
let’s say, if we take a corporation

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.060
like Microsoft, it was created

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.940
precisely as a culture of

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.620
task and achievement and based

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.840
on the competence of the

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.040
company owner today and

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.600
on his knowledge of a

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.440
particular product.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.320
It is a rapidly changing structure.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.740
Indeed, it is changing

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.600
rapidly, adapting to a changing

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.780
market.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.140
This is high flexibility and a great

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.980
expense of energy, enthusiasm.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.180
Such enthusiasm is good, of course, to

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.200
have, but for a short time people quickly exhale.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.900
As a rule, people work in such companies

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.400
for a maximum of 3-5 years.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.940
It’s almost impossible to keep

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.000
up with the pace, but the experience

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.620
people gain from working in such

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.960
companies with a culture of

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.580
achievement is just amazing.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.800
These are people who then leave such

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.240
companies and say, “I am not afraid

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.780
of anything in this life, I can

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.120
then work in absolutely

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.520
any company with any culture, I am

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.060
no longer afraid of anything.”

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.900
The criteria for success of this culture is the

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.960
fulfillment of the super-task.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.940
See also above.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.600
It is not just a functional

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.800
tracking, it is super-tasks.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.500
I have to do what I can’

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.560
t, and I’m sure it won’t work.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.820
It will work, go ahead.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.480
Communication, again, is only written.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.340
Leaders are gurus, they are professionals.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.200
They bring together the same enthusiasts,

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.020
the same fans of their business

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:38.780
and are ideological inspirers.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.360
Who works in such companies?

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.840
These are people who

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.380
are very professional in the field

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.340
because they need to perform

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.640
specific tasks and certain results.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.660
Very tough structure, very tough

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.680
company, a lot of enthusiasm,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.720
a lot of energy.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.060
Rarely anyone lasts longer than 5

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.040
years, but on the other hand, I repeat,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.420
a colossal experience.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.340
Culture of the person, of the person, of support.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.380
See how good it sounds when compared

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.780
to the previous one.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.020
In the previous almost so much

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.540
press, you survived all and you are free.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.620
And here is such a good company - the power

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.060
center of skills and the potential of

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.400
individual employees.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.740
It is difficult to manage

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.900
such an organization, because such

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.880
individual workers, who are

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.440
professionals, who are truly

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.240
unique employees in their knowledge,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.140
in their skills, they do not

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.080
recognize any authority over

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.280
themselves.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.160
They simply do not obey anyone.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.460
The criterion for success is the realization

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.660
of the potential of employees.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.080
I came here to be realized.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.760
Communication is more verbal than written.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.160
Leaders – see the potential,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.520
direct, develop properly.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.780
The worker - it all depends on

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.260
his skills, achievements and colossal

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.280
self-development, self-improvement.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.000
It is also an IT business.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.960
Look how interesting.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.860
The previous company is IT business and

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.000
this company is IT business.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.340
Other can also

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.120
be given examples.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:21.740
Let us stop at the IT sector.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.480
Two different cultures in one

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.080
sector, in one area.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.620
Why is?

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.740
Small companies that are created

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.560
with an enthusiast owner, who are

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.100
drawing up the same enthusiasts,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.800
colleagues, institutions,

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.520
some of their fellow students,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.500
who have a huge potential, internal

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.700
capabilities, want to self-reliance,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.520
earn money, close a project,

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.720
implement something.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.740
This is how they support each other.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.060
These enthusiasts create such companies

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.740
with a culture of personality

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.500
and, most importantly, support.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.840
Support and trust each other.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.400
And the last culture of power is

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.820
the sole centre of power and

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.000
control, the owner, he can be the

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.600
chairman of the board, he can be the

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.660
general director, he does

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.700
not recognize people who can replace

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.120
him, he does not pass on the

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.480
blades of the board.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.840
There are many such companies

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.860
in Russia now.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.880
And I think that such companies

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.020
are all heard by the names

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.240
of owners we know.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.380
Banks that are associated with

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.780
owners, some gas companies that

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.140
are engaged in development,

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:39.260
IT companies, some other types

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.480
of business that are associated

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.100
with the owner.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.680
Because he is a leader, he is an initiator,

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.340
an inspirer, and he is a strategist.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.060
All in one face, very hard.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.000
These people are young, they are between 35 and 50 years old.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.200
They started from the moment of the

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.980
market rise, somewhere 15-17, maybe

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.440
10-12 years ago.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.540
Everything is held on them, they do not

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.560
transmit, do not delegate anything.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.380
Companies can be from 50 to 1500 more

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.900
people, and everything

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.680
is concentrated in one hand.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.280
The advantages are

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.020
high competitiveness in difficult

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.120
market conditions.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.280
Abuse of power for personal

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.000
purposes.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.260
But I will say that these disadvantages

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.780
are virtually not visible in Russia

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.200
today, because these people

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.480
who are in power in their

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.520
own company do not abuse this power.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.880
The criterion for success is only the result.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.340
I don’t care why not.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.160
I am interested in what the outcome will be.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.400
Oral communication is.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.240
Indeed, in these companies, correspondence

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.780
is considered a bad tone.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.940
What are you writing to me?

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.380
I could not come and read a man.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.080
He focused everything on himself.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.180
People like that need to call.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.980
Of course, there are fears that he

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.560
will just forget that you called him and

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.780
said something.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.980
Therefore, in principle, as a advice,

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.300
after any such conversation you

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.860
need to send a letter according to our arrangement.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.120
During this phone

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.600
conversation, I confirm.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.140
The leaders have absolute

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.320
control over their subordinates.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.140
and loyalty.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.460
In such companies, by the way, there

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.880
is a very strong security system.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.880
Not only in the West, but in us.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.780
The same polygraph, which has been

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.560
actively discussed, has long been

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.540
used in the West.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.300
And, in principle, it is not

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.140
considered shameful if a person

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.300
passed a polygraph before

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.220
he was hired.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.260
For example, in the bank.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.780
And the employee, he, in principle,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.900
depends on the relationship of the manager

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.220
to him.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.780
Is this good or bad?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.260
Depends on how you have

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.240
a relationship with your boss.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.060
There are, of course, many

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.420
more, but here are four

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.300
main types of corporate

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.440
culture.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.640
There is a lot of work on corporate

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.720
culture in the West.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:07.000
So now I will attract

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.660
a small American model.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.480
If it was more European,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.240
worldwide, it was American.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.940
There are also four types.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.260
The Academy, the club, the baseball

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.740
team, but it’s generally purely

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.220
American, and a fortress.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.200
The Academy.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.590
Who is involved in such a company as the Academy?

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.570
Candidates for vacant positions,

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.450
managers, are young employees

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.190
who undergo very serious professional

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.810
selection, usually testing

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.490
and not one, with very

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.450
narrow specialization.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:45.630
I pay attention again, American,

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.370
because the narrow specialization

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.030
is inherent in Americans.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.650
They also work lawyers who know

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.750
Article 23 point A, and point

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.090
B, please, the next door, another

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.350
room.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.030
Sometimes we think it’s

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:00.170
funny because our education

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.610
is very broad.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.330
We are really from different areas

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.550
to give advice, we are theoretically

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.410
more prepared, but here they

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.230
have this approach.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.910
Right or not, it is hard to say.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.870
This is just such culture.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.670
Candidates who successfully

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.250
pass such exams are accepted

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.550
as managers-internships,

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.390
and there is a special

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.250
program for them.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.190
A lot of money is being spent on

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.670
training such managers.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.270
Of course, there is a danger that some

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.190
of them will leave, go to a competitor,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.590
go to other companies, it will be just

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.230
the money thrown out, but the

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.930
budget is so interesting that more

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.450
than one percent, two-thirds, remains

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:41.870
to work in the company, because

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:42.810
they are motivated by

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.610
a career, they are motivated

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.250
by a salary.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.310
The club.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:51.110
In itself, there is already

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.630
a sense of some sort of closure,

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.710
elitism, something like that,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.190
where we would like to go.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.390
Selection is based on experience,

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.410
work and knowledge.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.630
If young, energetic, ambitious people

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:05.370
are taken to the Academy, I want, I

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.310
can, I am created for this, then here

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.450
behind your shoulders

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.350
are such projects, you have such

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.070
such experience, you can pass

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.630
it on to us.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:18.850
As far as employees are willing

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.250
to sacrifice their interests for the

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.810
sake of the company, for the sake of the

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.610
organization, unlike the Academy, there

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.610
is training of managers of a broad profile.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.070
There, remember, a narrow specialization,

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:31.570
here a wide profile.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.370
A manager, for example, in the sales department

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.570
can be transferred by the manager,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:37.870
for example, to the marketing department

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.810
and vice versa.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.490
Pharmaceutical companies are

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.910
quite different in this.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.030
However, with a small reservation,

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.670
you need to have a medical

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.150
education to work in both

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.970
sales and marketing.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.230
There are noises in any closed club.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.830
In order to get there, you

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.350
need to have at least a

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.850
proper diploma.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.770
The fourth option is baseball.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.010
For the Russian version, I don’

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.450
t know how to call it.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.150
Football is difficult to compare with

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.850
our football, we are not very lucky.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.650
There is no analogy yet, maybe you will

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.510
come up with something by analogy.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:16.930
What people are selected by such

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.890
companies that are focused on success?

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.110
Very reminiscent of the Academy,

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.590
energetic, biased.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.730
Age is not important, it is

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.690
important to be beautiful.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.610
Finally, people after 40-45 can send

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.050
a bold resume to such a company

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.350
where they write, people under

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.790
30 are accepted over 30, ask not

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.130
to send a resume.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.390
Particular attention is paid to

00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:44.510
the potential of the employee, and pay attention

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.350
to the aggressiveness.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.810
Probably, such companies in the salespeople

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.110
must be absolutely aggressive,

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.130
uncontrollable, emotional,

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.130
because otherwise it is impossible

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:01.850
to sell anything.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.730
Ability to Risk.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.730
In general, employees have very

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.170
broad powers and freedom of action.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.590
True, beating for violating some things

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.470
and not bringing out results is very

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.990
painful.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.290
In such organizations, yes, unfortunately,

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.390
a lot of fluidity, because it is also

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.950
a sport.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.910
If you have run, you have to

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.110
run to the end.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.550
But whether you calculate your breath and your

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.050
strength or not, it is already your personal

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.930
matter.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.810
People from such companies

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.010
literally fall out, like in

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.130
sports, just fall out,

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.050
unfortunately, often in the hospital.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.870
Therefore, again, choosing

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.450
a company or analyzing, and in which

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.390
company I work today, is very careful.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.690
Compare your opportunities with

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:48.890
the requirements that the

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:50.230
company poses to you when

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.670
inviting you to work.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.450
The last one, the fortress, sounds good.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.310
Many organizations at one stage

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.050
of their development are

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.030
in a state of stagnation.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.490
Very familiar word.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.850
Such organizations do not develop,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.670
but try to survive.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.450
Well, we have already come out of this period,

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.370
say, of socialism, of stagnation, as

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:11.730
we called it when we survived.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.890
But, it turns out, there are such companies

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.030
under capitalism.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.090
That is, it is likely that

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.730
in a few decades our Russian

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.550
business may grow to

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.990
such companies that will

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.790
be a similar fortress.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.610
Why do people attract such companies?

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.830
Because they are quiet and stable.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.790
This is the word to sit over, yes,

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.130
you can sit over.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.850
In contrast, challenging people,

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.730
aggressive people, these companies

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:42.490
are not attracted.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.670
In fact, they will be boring themselves.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.530
Creating something new in this

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.090
company is almost impossible.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:50.850
In the process of forming

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.090
a corporate culture, such

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:55.890
an organization could develop

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.570
on any of the listed academies,

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.870
baseball teams or clubs.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.210
But at one point something happened,

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.550
or the company has reached its

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.510
highest results, and it turns

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.510
into a fortress.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.470
And so the situation in the market,

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.330
in the market, in which the company

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.970
played, according to internal

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.550
and external factors, that this organization

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.950
ceased to develop and

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.450
fell into a state of stagnation.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.450
A few words about corporate culture.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.050
Actually, they say, well,

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.310
in some companies there is a culture,

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.010
in some not, I don’t even

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:39.070
know where I try to think.

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.970
If you like the company you

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.970
work for, you think,

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.810
and why do I like it?

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.870
The people.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.630
What are?

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.010
What kind of people?

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.730
I work because I like the

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.190
people I work with.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.190
Look at what people?

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.850
I like the relationship, the

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.670
guidance to us, between people, between

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.170
departments.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.010
And what shortcomings?

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.050
As a pluss.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.570
The emerging corporate culture

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:08.930
supports the commitment

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.550
of employees to the company’

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.750
s values.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.910
In a strong corporate culture, employees

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:17.330
and those employees who are willing

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:21.010
to contribute to the efficiency and

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:26.210
development of the company are

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.050
highly valued.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.550
Corporate culture sets the rules of the

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.610
game in any business situation, in any

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.070
business situation.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.110
Rules are prescribed.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.690
If so, then you should

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.250
do so, and if not, then

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:38.010
so.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.090
Violations of rules are punished by rules.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.490
The Minuses.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.850
Sometimes a strong corporate

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.230
culture can serve as

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.790
obstacles and some

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.070
necessary changes.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.090
We need to change quickly, be

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.330
flexible, and we can’t.

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.470
The culture is not allowed by corporate, the standards

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.210
are not allowed, they need to be changed,

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.090
this is not a quick matter.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.070
And of course, different

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.890
corporate cultures can

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:06.250
have a negative impact on

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.010
mergers.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.790
Now it’s very fashionable, and

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.110
you’re probably hearing one company

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.850
merges with another, the acquisition,

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.830
but that one company was, for example,

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.570
a power company or a role, connected

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.970
with a company of personality,

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.690
support.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.110
How will they be together?

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:27.970
It’s almost like getting married or getting married.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.510
It is very difficult, you must calculate

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.930
everything correctly.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.890
What else affects corporate culture?

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.730
Natural style of management.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:41.670
In the head of any company is a manager.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.410
Leaders are divided, like all of

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.790
us, into men and women.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.570
And there is, well, I have outlined,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.850
in general, three main styles of management.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.350
Of course, if you break them in more

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.630
detail, then of course, there may

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.010
be more, but the main three.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:39:59.990
It is a directive, it

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.770
is an authoritarian, democratic

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.230
or collegial, and liberal, it

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.810
is anarchic, nominal, non-

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.590
interferent and connivent.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:14.130
Now let’s see what styles

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.290
of management prefer men and

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:16.990
what women.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:18.890
You probably noticed that

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:24.410
style is anarchic, nominal,

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.150
not interfering.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.510
Why is?

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.370
Well, in principle, it probably takes

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:29.930
the upper motherhood beginning.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.830
What mother will not allow herself

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.750
to interfere in her child’s affairs?

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.430
No normal mother would allow it.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.150
Women do not accept this style.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.790
Democratically, look at how

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:43.170
many women and only 25 percent

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.070
of men.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.750
I prefer the democratic style.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:47.830
Why is?

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.810
A woman should be advised.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:53.130
It is like consulting with your husband, with colleagues.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.250
Men prefer authoritarian style.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.390
Women are only 30 percent.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.570
But I wonder, from your experience, which

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.310
women are easier to work with?

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.070
Which are authoritarian or democratic?

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.890
Which ones are easier

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.910
to move business forward?

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:12.710
The question is not festive.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.470
Now it is very difficult to do some

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:16.750
sort of analysis of Russian

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.150
business, but if we are to

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.730
observe the market and for another

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.430
10 years to follow closely how

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.190
it really is happening,

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.690
I think there will be very interesting

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.390
conclusions.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.970
So maybe we’ll meet again

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.230
in a while and share our impressions

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.990
on the subject.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.540
What styles are effective?

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.460
Indeed, there is no person who is purely

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.120
authoritarian or completely

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.240
democratic, because there are no

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:48.940
such people.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:49.400
Role of.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.960
Remember, we are all in the theatre, mine.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.720
Theatre is life, life is theatre.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.680
We play different roles.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.240
Things have changed, we have a different role.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.520
Today someone is Cinderella, tomorrow someone

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.280
is a Good Fairy, and after tomorrow someone is a Baby.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.040
In different ways, because the market

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.600
is changing, because the business, because

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.920
the colleagues have changed, management,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.500
something else has changed, and I

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.920
have changed.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.980
Directional, authoritarian, in

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.740
extreme conditions, yes, otherwise

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:20.260
survive in one hand.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.100
I decided I was responsible.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.540
The question of responsibility is very

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.180
important.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.960
People love to lead, but it

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.540
is not desirable to take responsibility.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.540
Responsibility is an important element.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.440
Democratic, standard, stable

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.040
conditions, when you can calculate,

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.880
apply some algorithms, find

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.620
out, you can afford to fantasize

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.980
on the subject of

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.760
business in time, and liberal.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.980
The liberal, in large part, is ideal

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.540
during mergers and acquisitions.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.220
If the cultures do not coincide,

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.680
then one company takes this not

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.200
interference position.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.120
Those who absorb them are most likely to behave

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.240
authoritatively towards these liberals,

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.440
while those are quietly sitting and waiting.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.860
It really requires a very high amount

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.480
of nervous tension and the ability

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.900
not to interfere and not to get out.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.100
A certain psycho.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.120
It is important to remember that, as a rule,

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.200
in its pure form, none of the aforementioned

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.600
styles is found.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.000
And it really is.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.020
The leader of an organization usually

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.980
carries the features of not one but

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.640
several styles of management.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.460
The style is influenced by external factors,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.860
market, age of the company and

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.440
internal personality, such as the

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.000
manager, his education and characteristics

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.040
of the staff.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.440
In general, the staff

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.020
is selected by the managers.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.280
So look carefully what your

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.480
leader is, what styles he

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.080
likes to use and whether

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.340
he will suit you as a leader.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.800
Or if you are a leader, try

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.500
to evaluate yourself as your subordinate

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.180
lives with you.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.280
The man in the organization is that.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.980
You are a person, manager or employee

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.300
of an organization with their own

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.640
types of corporate culture, with their

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.540
own different styles of management.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.440
What else is important to remember?

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.520
As a rule, none of these types

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.460
of corporate culture are found

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.640
in pure form.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.880
Not only styles, but types as well.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.780
Organization usually carries features

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.760
not of one, but of several types.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.340
Indeed, we begin to develop

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.680
as support, as a task, and eventually

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.480
we can come to the type of power,

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.740
for example.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.120
The corporate culture is, again,

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.180
exposed to external factors, such as

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.900
competition or new laws, and internal

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.260
factors with management,

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.460
for example, completely

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.680
at the wish of the company owner.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:52.730
What external factors, if we

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.810
talk about it in more detail, exist?

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:59.670
These are customers and service users.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:03.350
Any company, whatever it does,

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.030
is created for customers.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.490
Goods and markets.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.410
You need to know clearly the needs,

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.090
the needs of those people for whom

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.390
you create a business and for whom

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:16.270
we work.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.290
The Suppliers.

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.190
Of course, these are resources markets.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.610
The price is the availability

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.010
and use of resources.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.790
Natural competitors that

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.530
do not allow us to sleep,

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.090
rest, relax.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.830
They limit our freedom and our organization.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:34.190
Playing on one field.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.910
There are so many players on the

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.630
same field that it gets tight.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:40.450
Why is there a merger and acquisition?

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:43.750
Because the larger the company, the easier

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:46.530
it is to push smaller ones out of the

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.430
market.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.890
Technology and technique.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:50.810
But it is already quite modern.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.030
They help in a particular competitive

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.330
struggle.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:59.030
The company is developing more and

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:01.370
more new products.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.670
Again, take the IT sector, because

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.190
it is the fastest technology

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.690
to be implemented.

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.950
Medicine, of course, too

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:12.870
From one time to another, the

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.050
time is reduced.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.890
Technical progress is going

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.750
on faster and faster.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.290
The external factor is

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:21.050
the state.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.390
Today we lived under one law, tomorrow

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:29.170
to re-register it, to license everything

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.890
in a new way, to certify it.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.090
We start to waste a lot

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:36.950
of time in business.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:38.990
These are serious external factors.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:47.170
What else affects a person in the organization?

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:50.650
Of course, I was talking about

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.370
resources, material, natural,

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.830
human resources.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.050
And in human resources, the main distinctive

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.590
component is the presence

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.770
of intelligence, the ability

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.830
to constantly improve.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.050
And, of course, people come consciously

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:09.470
into the organization.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:11.450
These are very important things.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.030
We will be slowly moving towards

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.310
motivation.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.730
Step by step, without rushing.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:26.850
We looked at the person in the organization.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:30.310
That is, a person comes into

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.110
some organization, in which there

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.310
is already a corporate culture,

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:37.490
there is already a certain

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:39.670
style of management.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.170
Under this corporate culture and

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:43.890
style people are selected,

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.110
strategy, structure,

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:48.430
a certain hierarchy is

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.150
built, and you get to a certain

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.230
level of hierarchy.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:56.870
We summarize.

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.850
What do we have?

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.590
We have an organization, we have an

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:02.350
organizational structure, we have

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.970
an external culture, we have already

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.050
talked about.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.830
Another factor is the availability

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:11.070
of human resources.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:13.150
The motivation.
