00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What are the research tasks?

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
If we talk about the research tasks that are solved by means of questionnaire surveys,

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
then the research tasks consist of understanding of information needs,

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
or the research tasks can be solved by understanding what information needs are determined in this form of marketing research.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
For example, what is the likely demand for the supposed goods or services?

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
And here it is necessary to study the knowledge of people's attitude to the existing options of products or services,

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
the degree of awareness, for example, I know and use, or I know but do not use.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
You feel the difference in these options of answers,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
because if I know and use, it is typical consumer of services,

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
and I know but do not use, the next question should be,

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
why do not you use, and is it possible to transfer this non-consumer, but knowing about the services of the consumer,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
the respondent to the category of consumers?

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
What segments will be more interested in such services?

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
Information needs, source of information, for example, where did you learn about the offer of goods or services,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
or the factors that make the choice,

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
and also the degree of satisfaction with the existing product, either in general or with individual services,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
and the intention to change.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
And other research tasks, for example, what is the approximate percentage of use of these services, these segments,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
and what are the characteristics?

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
We are now talking about an example in the form of paid medical services,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
an example of the offer of paid medical services,

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
and conducting a questionnaire from the point of view of identifying information needs

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
and preferences, knowledge, and use of medical services of different medical centers among respondents.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Types of questionnaire questions have already been mentioned,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
so here I will speak quickly enough.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
There may be open or unstructured questions,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
their advantage is in the variety of answers,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
the disadvantages in the complexity of processing,

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
because the processing of open questions, where respondents are given the opportunity to answer questions independently,

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
as they want, without choosing answers,

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
and the complexity of processing is the same as in processing and analyzing high-quality information,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
which is also unstructured.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
Application. For example, you can use open questions as a part of a questionnaire.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
What do you think about the brand, the company, its reputation, the brand?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
When it is necessary to determine which aspects are important for the respondents,

03:10.000 --> 03:18.000
for example, you can ask what will be the most important for you when choosing medical services.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
Here the respondents are given the opportunity to answer the problem openly and, most importantly, unstructuredly,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
that is, to answer from the point of view of their understanding of the problem.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
The next type of questions is closed or structured questions,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
which can be of two types, either dichotomous questions with only two possible answers,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
yes-no, half-male, half-female,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
and questions of the so-called multiple choice,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
that is, they are sometimes called test questions,

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
when the respondents are given the opportunity to choose from several options of answers.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Sometimes such questions are semi-structured,

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
that is, in addition to the answers proposed by the researchers for such questions,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
a line is offered, which is called another,

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
and the respondent is given the opportunity to express his or her own opinion very briefly in one line.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Usually, the categories of answers previously developed by the researchers are used.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
The number of such categories, that is, options, answers, does not exceed 5-7,

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
but sometimes there is such an approach to assess the associations of the called brands,

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
to determine loyal consumers or to determine the importance of the range of these associations.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
Such questions, categories of options, answers can be expanded to 10-20.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
For example, such characteristics, which are usually included in the questionnaire for assessing,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I say again, associations associated with the brand,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
which can then be put at the beginning of the communication campaign.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
It is assessed on a 5- or 7-point scale from absolutely disagreeable to completely agreeable.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
The typical number of constructs can be from 10 to 20,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
and these constructs represent certain associations.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
For example, this is my brand, this is a brand for me, this is a home brand, this is a brand for my family,

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
or this is a brand of a snob, this is a brand of a person who demonstrates his position in society, and so on.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
That is, this pool of answers can be spread to 10-20 options.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
Of course, such a question requires time and, most importantly, attention of the respondents.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
In this case, interviewers help them answer these questions.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
These questions, it is meant, distract from a negative perception,

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
so that the respondent still filled out the questionnaire to the end.

06:05.000 --> 06:14.000
Such information becomes very important for the subsequent creation of an advertising concept and an advertising campaign,

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
because such associations can be put at the beginning of the advertising message on the promotion of this brand,

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
or in the very concept of creating a brand communication with the consumer.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
The last type of questions is semi-structured, I have already talked about this.

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
It is necessary to focus on typical constructs of questions in order to find out the situation with the respondent.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
We call them questions about the respondents themselves, or questions about respondents.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Questions about age. It is better to ask about the age interval, we have already mentioned this in today's lecture.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
The interval should be compared with a certain age of the target segment of the study.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
When I told you about the target segment of mayonnaise consumers from 25 to 55 years,

07:04.000 --> 07:13.000
nevertheless, behavior and, most importantly, preferences of age groups that are included in this target segment differ.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Therefore, demographic questions about age should be asked,

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
taking into account the variations in behavior of women of different ages.

07:26.000 --> 07:37.000
For example, 25-35 years old usually demonstrate an aspiration to maintain athletic shape, health, and so on.

07:37.000 --> 07:50.000
They demonstrate an aspiration to lighter mayonnaise without cholesterol, with less fat, or based on the use of vegetable oil, and so on.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
Questions about income. There are several approaches to asking questions about the income of respondents.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
It can be a direct question with the use of the interval, and at the same time, it is necessary to take into account

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
that the respondent must clearly understand what they want from him.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
They want to know about his individual monthly income, or the total income of the family per month or per year,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
or the household in which this respondent lives.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
In any case, certain income intervals should be set.

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
It all depends on the average income level and the maximum possible income for the respondents,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
who represent the target audience of a particular product.

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
If we talk about various indirect questions that can be asked to determine the level of the income of the respondent,

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
then you can ask a question, or ask about the intention to purchase a high-value product.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
For example, do you plan to purchase an apartment or a country cottage next year?

09:01.000 --> 09:11.000
Or, as I said, there is an indirect classification of income levels for various levels of respondents.

09:11.000 --> 09:19.000
This classification comes from the upper limit, the upper bar, I can afford to buy everything except real estate,

09:19.000 --> 09:27.000
or including real estate, the next rank, I can afford to buy everything, not including real estate.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
And the lower bar, I have enough money only for food, or I can hardly find money only for food.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
The classification of questionnaire questions, behavioral characteristics of the questionnaire,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
factual information about who the respondent is.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
For example, this information can be used to determine the size of the market,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
to determine the share of the product in the market,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
awareness of the product and its wide use by individual respondents,

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
questions about determining relationships, what the respondent thinks about a particular item,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
about the product, about the product's quality, ratings, reasons for actions,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
determining the image of the study, classification questions.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
These are the most interesting questions in marketing studies,

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
because they give the opportunity to get information to divide respondents into groups.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
Even those respondents we interviewed, regardless of whether we collected 150 or 1050 questionnaire questions,

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
they can be used in all types of surveys.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
The typical structure of the questionnaire.

10:31.000 --> 10:44.000
First of all, it should be said that the questionnaire for phone examination or for personal survey

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
should be divided into four components.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
The beginning of the questionnaire, then the following several questions that are of warming nature,

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
then the questions that in English were called the main part of the questionnaire,

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
or the body of the questionnaire, up to the end of the main part,

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
and finally, the final part of the questionnaire, where the personal questions about respondents are included.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
This topic will be unfinished if we do not consider the possibility of measuring information

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
in marketing studies, because the design of the questionnaire questions and the design of the questionnaire in general

11:30.000 --> 11:41.000
is directly related to the methods of statistics or analysis that will be used to measure the statements of respondents.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
If we talk about conducting questionnaire surveys and designing a competent questionnaire,

11:49.000 --> 11:58.000
we remember that a questionnaire is a set of logical, structured questions or survey.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
We say that, especially in closed questions, various scales are used,

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
which allow to measure quantitatively the results of the examination,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
the results of the respondents' answers to certain questions,

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
that is, the results of the respondents' choice of certain answers to certain questions.

12:22.000 --> 12:32.000
For example, I told you several times that you can use such a design as a scale from 0 to 5,

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
or from 1 to 5, or from 0 to 7, or from 1 to 7,

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
which, if you consider it in more detail, means 0 or 1,

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
that is, the smallest value of this scale means absolutely disagreeable,

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
and 5 or 7 means absolutely agreeable to the statement presented in the answer.

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
These scales or these possibilities are called measurements,

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
or measurements are defined as a number of measures or density of a certain characteristic,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
which is of interest to the study.

13:15.000 --> 13:24.000
For example, the study of a characteristic that means the preference or rejection of a statement,

13:24.000 --> 13:32.000
or self-updating of oneself as a representative of the middle class,

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
that is, a representative of a cohort of the population that has a higher education,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
has a career, some steps of this career,

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
implements his own business, is the owner of a business,

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
or is a manager of a middle and higher rank,

13:52.000 --> 14:05.000
and has a certain level of income, which, of course, varies from where this representative lives and works.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
Thus, measurements are a procedure for comparing objects by certain characteristics or signs.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
For example, you can measure the temperature in this audience,

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
and a scale will be taken as the basis of the measurement.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
The most common in our situation is the Celsius scale, from 0 to 100 degrees,

14:29.000 --> 14:38.000
where the freezing point of water, which was taken at the beginning of the measurement,

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
is understood as a zero point, and 100 degrees is the boiling point of water.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
Another scale, which is also widely used, especially in North America, for temperature measurements,

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
has a completely different character, and a completely different statistical procedure is embedded in it,

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
the Fahrenheit scale, where the zero point does not mean the freezing point of water at all,

15:02.000 --> 15:11.000
because all scales have a certain relative character, relative to either the beginning or some object.

15:11.000 --> 15:20.000
And in the Fahrenheit scale, completely different features of the statistical procedure for measuring objects will be embedded.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
There is a scale for measuring the hardness of MOAS objects.

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
Hardness measurements of objects, for example, in particular, of precious stones or the weight of precious stones,

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
you know that this scale implies a unit of measurement called the Carat.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
There is a scale for measuring, for example, the oscillations of the Earth,

15:46.000 --> 15:55.000
especially for seismic-dangerous regions, or a scale for measuring the speed of the wind,

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
or the size of the waves, the oscillations of the world ocean, and so on.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
But we will not talk about this, we will not talk about temperature measurements,

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
we will talk about the measurable features or indicators that are used in marketing research

16:13.000 --> 16:22.000
to determine objects of some, for example, consumers, or brands of products, shops, advertisements, preferences of consumers, and so on.

16:23.000 --> 16:34.000
As indicators and comparisons of objects, some spatial, temporal, physical, physiological, sociological, psychological, or other features and characteristics of the product are used.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
We say that measurements can be made using various scales.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
Why am I talking about scales and why does it immediately correspond to the design of surveys?

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
Because scales are a component of surveys, especially questions that are closed.

16:54.000 --> 17:01.000
Four characteristics of comparative scales, comparative with some object.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
It can be an ideal object or a comparison of objects between themselves.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
It can be a description, order, distance, and the presence of the starting point.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
I just told you about the presence of the starting point.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
In Celsius, at the starting point of temperature measurement, there was a freezing point,

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
and the final point, if we take as a basis this object, was the boiling point of water.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Now about different types of scales.

17:32.000 --> 17:46.000
Scaling can be based on the order of empirical properties, which are some kind of scale estimates.

17:47.000 --> 17:57.000
I repeat that a consumer can be offered to build his own arrangement from the number of brands he knows,

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
or his own order of listing of these brands, the first ones that come to his mind.

18:03.000 --> 18:12.000
For example, the brands of toothpaste that he knows, that he uses, or that he plans to buy.

18:12.000 --> 18:20.000
If we conduct such an experiment now, I am sure that 90% of the listeners who are here now

18:20.000 --> 18:27.000
under the number one brand will call Colgate, which naturally created this image, this brand,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
with the help of various marketing communications.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
This does not mean at all that you are all its consumers.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
Maybe this knowledge and this choice are based only on the brand's knowledge.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
But in fact, at home you use another brand and another manufacturer.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
When we talk about scaling or measurements, we always remember two indicators.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
As in the indicators of quantity, the quantity, mass, state of matter, object or system

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
that exist in the form of order, listing, a multitude of qualities.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
And the qualities that denote the essential properties of the object.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
We can measure both.

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
We can measure the number of brands that exist, or we can measure the quality characteristics,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
attributes of these brands.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
For example, the Colgate brand is widely known, and at the same time we cannot say that this brand is for me.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Because we use the brand Locolut, for example,

19:29.000 --> 19:40.000
which has a positioning that it is sold in a limited distribution channel only through pharmaceutical systems.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.000
In the next two slides, you can see the main characteristics of four comparative scales.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
There are four of them in total.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Nominal, order, comparative and interval scale.

19:55.000 --> 20:05.000
And the main examples from marketing or examples from various types of statistics

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
that can be used for the analysis of answers.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Nominal scale.

20:10.000 --> 20:18.000
When correspondents are offered to list some objects.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It can be a number of a book.

20:21.000 --> 20:29.000
This does not mean that a student with the number of a book number one will be considered the first in the rating.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Because it demonstrates the best success in study.

20:35.000 --> 20:43.000
When we analyze this scale, various methods of descriptive statistics can be used.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Such as percentage ratios or the most frequently repeated meaning of the fashion.

20:50.000 --> 20:58.000
We are not talking about fashion, but about fashion as a statistical value.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
The most frequently repeated meaning.

21:00.000 --> 21:12.000
I repeat, if I ask you to raise your hands of those students who will be called the number one brand in the category of toothpaste by Colgate,

21:13.000 --> 21:23.000
and most of them will remain, then we will calculate how often this meaning is repeated from the total number of participants.

21:23.000 --> 21:32.000
And if we talk about deductive statistics, then the X-square criterion is used,

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000
which is possible for the analysis of the purity of the repetition of the mention of this brand or the knowledge of this brand, and so on.

21:41.000 --> 21:50.000
The next comparative scale, which refers to the methods of scaling, is called the order scale.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
Here, the numbers mean the relative positions, but not the amount of differences between them.

21:57.000 --> 22:12.000
For example, the quality levels, the team levels in the tournament, or the ranging of preferences or market positions of a certain brand from the point of view of the consumer.

22:13.000 --> 22:33.000
For example, the respondents are offered a list of brands or products, and it is proposed to arrange the ranks of which product or brand will be preferable from the point of view of a particular respondent,

22:33.000 --> 22:40.000
which will be in the second place, which will be in the third, from the point of view of mentions or the possibility of use, and so on.

22:40.000 --> 22:54.000
Here, the percentages or the possibility of determining the percentage ratio of the number of mentions or the presentation of this brand or another brand,

22:54.000 --> 23:04.000
number one or number two, from the point of view of descriptive statistics, and from the point of view of deductive statistics, dispersion analysis or rank correlation are used.

23:05.000 --> 23:15.000
We do not say that there will be an equal distance between these categories, number one and number two.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
We do not know about this, and this is not included in the measurement.

23:20.000 --> 23:36.000
We say that from the point of view of consumers, if they do not see this brand, which they call number one, they can purchase a substitute product or a brand that their competitors produce.

23:36.000 --> 23:49.000
The next scale is the interval scale. Here we are talking about the difference between objects that are compared, and the starting point of the report is chosen arbitrarily.

23:49.000 --> 24:00.000
For example, the temperature that is measured on the Fahrenheit scale. There is no starting point that would correspond to some characteristic of the object.

24:01.000 --> 24:14.000
Here, in the interval scales, we can measure the attitude of consumers, some coefficients, for example, enter coefficients of importance, the significance of some rank,

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
according to which consumers evaluate their attitude to a particular characteristic of a product or brand.

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
For example, if we talk about personal computers, we are talking about portable personal computers, laptops.

24:29.000 --> 24:48.000
When I choose my personal computer, I say that the most important characteristic for me, in addition to technological properties, in addition to memory and the ability to install a certain set of programs into this computer,

24:48.000 --> 24:56.000
the most important characteristic after that is its weight and size, because I carry it with me very often.

24:56.000 --> 25:05.000
For professionals, such a characteristic, and for men, such a characteristic will not be the most important.

25:05.000 --> 25:19.000
For young people from another segment, in the third or first place in terms of significance, and in this case we must clearly know what coefficient of significance to enter in this case,

25:19.000 --> 25:38.000
may be the color of this computer. And note that many manufacturers, including my respected Sony, in response to these market requirements, began to produce computers of different colors in order to offer them to different consumers.

25:38.000 --> 25:45.000
And, in the end, the relative scale, the starting point of something is fixed, as in the Celsius scale.

25:45.000 --> 25:52.000
Coefficients can be calculated according to this scale, for example, length, width are examples.

25:52.000 --> 26:02.000
The starting point is the point where you stand. The width of this room or its length can be measured from both angles.

26:02.000 --> 26:12.000
There is a fixed starting point. Age, of course, has a zero starting point. Income can have a zero starting point.

26:12.000 --> 26:30.000
Expenses, sales volume, market share, the same thing. From zero to, for example, 50-70%, as some manufacturers of mobile phones and cellular phone declare.

26:30.000 --> 26:43.000
In this case, statistics methods are used, which are called the average geometric or average harmonic, which allow to smooth out these coefficients and variations.

26:43.000 --> 26:56.000
If we talk about other scales that allow to measure the attitude and emotions of consumers in contrast to these purely statistical and mathematical scales,

26:56.000 --> 27:05.000
they are called incomparable scales and they have the nature of so-called detailed rating scales.

27:05.000 --> 27:17.000
Pay attention to the comparison of scaling methods in the next slide. There are only three such scales, the most common, although there are some configurations of these scales,

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
based on which there are the three basic scales presented on this slide.

27:22.000 --> 27:32.000
The scale named after the creator of Leikert, the semantic differential of Charles Osgood and the stepel scale.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
These are different configurations of scales for measuring the attitude of respondents to a particular object that is being studied.

27:39.000 --> 27:56.000
If we talk about the methods of incomparable scaling in order to measure the attitude and emotions of respondents, for example, in the studies called A&U, Attitudes and Usage Research,

27:56.000 --> 28:06.000
that is, the study of the attitude and use of products or services. Detailed rating scales contain numbers and their brief description,

28:06.000 --> 28:15.000
so that the respondent who answers the question becomes immediately clear how he evaluates this characteristic or this object.

28:15.000 --> 28:24.000
The Leikert scale, for example, serves to measure the attitude and contains the degree of agreement from 1 to 5, absolutely disagreeable.

28:24.000 --> 28:39.000
Sometimes this scale can be extended to 7 or 9, but in Russian it is quite difficult to describe these intermediate characteristics,

28:39.000 --> 28:48.000
because there will be not enough words, or somewhere there will be a transition through an absolutely indifferent neutral attitude.

28:49.000 --> 29:01.000
Although, different kinds of scales are used in different markets. In Russia, the 5-point scale is most often used, as we were evaluated at school or in institutes.

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
In Europe, the 7-point scale is in high esteem, and in the United States, America, at least 9.

29:09.000 --> 29:18.000
But in English there are more opportunities for a very brief description of these intermediate values in this scale.

29:18.000 --> 29:33.000
The Osgoode semantic differential is a scale that is used for image analysis, for positioning analysis, and, among other things, for profile analysis of segments.

29:33.000 --> 29:46.000
The 5-7-point scale has so-called bipolar marks. Bipolar marks are antonyms, words that reflect the characteristics of the object, from negative to positive.

29:46.000 --> 30:04.000
For example, the menu of a restaurant, how it can be, is it extensive, wide, or very limited. Limited in this case has a negative connotation,

30:04.000 --> 30:23.000
and a wide menu means that the consumer has the opportunity to choose. Or the location of the restaurant, again, as in the case of Univermag, central, not far from the subway or some shopping malls, or peripheral.

30:23.000 --> 30:39.000
This means that this restaurant has a peripheral meaning and is located somewhere in the sleeping area. And the last scale, the Staple scale, the unipolar, most often the 10-point scale, without the starting point, serves to measure the relationship of images.

30:39.000 --> 30:57.000
Why is it called unipolar? Because it goes from a negative assessment to a positive assessment. Please look at this slide. This slide is borrowed from the book by Nere Shomolhotri, Marketing Research, Practical Guidance.

30:57.000 --> 31:21.000
This slide shows the use of semantic differential to measure the perception of people or some products. And based on the analysis of the number of responses of respondents, so-called comparative snake-like diagrams are made, which reflect a certain comparison of images.

31:21.000 --> 31:37.000
In the case of analysis of an object that provides services, for example, a high school that offers MBA programs compares itself to its competitor.

31:37.000 --> 31:51.000
In this case, there will be, for example, a convenient and inconvenient location, and then the characteristics of people who work and who are inextricably linked with the provision of educational services.

31:51.000 --> 32:05.000
And what kind of people, what kind of teachers or specialists who work and meet with students, with consumers, are rude or refined, inconvenient or convenient, dominant, secondary, and so on.

32:05.000 --> 32:17.000
Two objects are compared. One object, its characteristics, its profile, is marked with a dark graph, a snake-like diagram. The other object is marked with a red graph.

32:17.000 --> 32:34.000
An example of the Likert scale. I like to solve crosswords. From 1 to 5, I do not agree or completely disagree, I agree. An example of the Staple scale. Please evaluate how accurately the word or phrase describes the research of my university of magic.

33:04.000 --> 33:18.000
To evaluate the opinions of respondents, whose opinion is very important, but it is even more difficult to attract their attention than the attention of a highly profitable audience. These are children.

33:18.000 --> 33:33.000
In this case, their opinion is very important to us, because they are, if not buyers, then consumers of products and services of some, and users of this product, and can influence the decision-making on the acquisition.

33:33.000 --> 33:44.000
But in order to interest them, you can use some unique configurations of rating scales. For example, the thermometer scale. Determine how much you like the McDonald's product.

33:44.000 --> 33:58.000
And paint the image of the thermometer to a mark that best reflects your attitude. By the way, here the scale from 0 to 100 is used. I don't like it at all in the 0 area, and I really like it in the 100 area.

33:58.000 --> 34:09.000
Or the smiley faces scale. Determine how much you like the Barbie doll, indicating the expression of the face that best reflects your attitude. If you don't like the doll, point to the face 1.

34:09.000 --> 34:28.000
If you like it very much, then face 5. Note that the face here is the widest smile, and face 1 is the tips of the lips lowered down. This means that the person does not like or is not satisfied with the product offered to him.

34:28.000 --> 34:45.000
I can tell you that the examples of these questions are taken from the student projects that our students conducted for the marketing research projects. In particular, the last question from the questionnaire, which was compiled at the request of the Motel company here in Russia.

34:45.000 --> 35:11.000
We move on to the next topic, which is called the election survey. What number of respondents must be interviewed, and the size of the election and, most importantly, the method of selecting respondents from the general general summary in order to reduce the percentage of uncertainty and the probability of obtaining invalid, unrepresentative data.

35:11.000 --> 35:31.000
After we decided that we were conducting a quantitative survey, when we decided and compiled a questionnaire to obtain primary data from respondents, the next decision that must be made is to determine who and how many respondents we will interview.

35:41.000 --> 35:58.000
The question is, what is the general summary of the target audience, which is oriented to our product or service. In order to get you up to date, it is necessary to first focus on the main definitions. What is the general summary or Population?

35:58.000 --> 36:23.000
The summary of all the elements that have a number of common characteristics and which covers a complete set of elements in terms of the problem of marketing research. I repeat that marketing research in the election surveys, in the principles of conducting election surveys, uses methods of sociological research, but the goals of marketing research are different.

36:23.000 --> 36:48.000
The goals of marketing research are to study the attitude, perception, use, lifestyle of respondents, etc. The use of products or services, etc. Thus, the general summary can be understood by the entire population, which prefers or is the target audience of a specific type of products or services.

36:48.000 --> 37:17.000
For example, the educational service that offers a program of marketing retraining will be oriented not to the entire population of the country or Moscow or some specific region, but will be oriented only to people who have a higher education and who, of course, mainly work in the field of marketing or want to change their orientation to professional marketing.

37:17.000 --> 37:35.000
There are other important definitions that must be remembered when studying the topic of election surveys. The census is a complete list of elements of the general summary.

37:35.000 --> 37:52.000
You know, the census conducted by the State Statistics Committee of the Russian Federation, the last census was in 2002, and the previous census was held in the Soviet Union in 1989.

37:52.000 --> 38:18.000
You can imagine how expensive it was to participate in this census, if each element of the selected summary, excluding infants who cannot answer for themselves, took part in this census.

38:18.000 --> 38:35.000
A priori, the number of market subjects is always limited, and you can ask almost any market participant. The selection or sample for many elements of the general summary is selected for participation in the survey.

38:35.000 --> 39:02.000
The basis of the sample frame is the list of elements from which the sample will be produced. For example, it can be the territorial units of Moscow or its separate regions, organizations that are being examined, for example, high school students or high school graduates who will take the entrance exams at the university tomorrow or in a few other days.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
And some other elements can be the basis of the selection.

39:32.000 --> 39:56.000
The selection process is considered possible in higher educational institutions this year. As in many marketing studies, this process is quite logical and each step flows from one to another and is interconnected.

39:56.000 --> 40:05.000
At the first stage, the general summary is determined, then the basis of the selection is determined, for example, high school graduates of Moscow.

40:05.000 --> 40:25.000
Then the method of selection is determined, how we will survey them, where we will survey them, whether we will survey them near the institutes, for example, at the moment when they submit documents or when they are in line for passing through the examination commission for the exam.

40:25.000 --> 40:38.000
Or other methods of achieving the units of selection will be used, that is, the achievement and stimulation of individual respondents, who represent the units of selection.

40:38.000 --> 40:52.000
Then the volume is determined, how many respondents are needed and enough, surveyed in order to ensure that their data can be extrapolated to the entire general summary and, in the end, conduct the examination itself.

40:52.000 --> 41:00.000
The average volumes of selection in marketing studies. I really like this slide and I draw your attention to it.

41:00.000 --> 41:10.000
I repeat that this slide is borrowed from the book by Nere Shomal Khotry, who has a lot of experience in conducting consultative and marketing studies.

41:10.000 --> 41:19.000
But most importantly, he collected information in this textbook about the typical volumes of selection, in particular.

41:19.000 --> 41:36.000
For example, if we talk about research aimed at determining the potential or capacity of the market, determining the problem, the minimum volume of respondents is 500 respondents, 500 surveys, the usual range is from 1000 to 2500.

41:36.000 --> 41:53.000
Please note that these numbers are not so large, because if you meet or order a study, it seems to you that the more selection, the more respondents are surveyed, the more reliable the results will be.

41:53.000 --> 42:01.000
In fact, the number of respondents or the number of processed information does not mean the quality of the information received.

42:01.000 --> 42:16.000
In the case of a selection based on statistics or a quantitative or certified approach, it will be enough to survey from 500 to 1000 people.

42:16.000 --> 42:32.000
And it will be possible to indicate with reliability or accuracy up to a certain percentage that this information can be extrapolated to the entire general population.

42:32.000 --> 42:45.000
Research on price determination to solve the problem, for example, on the operational level, from 300 to 500 respondents, the usual range, the minimum number is 200 respondents.

42:45.000 --> 43:00.000
Considering that some surveys may be defective, incorrectly filled or not fully filled, 200 must be taken for the minimum, that is, it is necessary to fill 200, but they must be accurately filled.

43:00.000 --> 43:23.000
Testing of the product, the same volume, trial marketing, the same volume, evaluation of television, radio, print and advertising for one advertising ad to determine its effectiveness.

43:23.000 --> 43:41.000
The minimum volume is only 150 surveys. Again, these surveys must be correctly filled. The usual range is from 200 to 300 surveys to reduce the degree of uncertainty and the risk of incorrect filling of surveys by respondents.

43:41.000 --> 44:01.000
The audit on the trial market is 10 shops or 10-20 shops for the minimum volume.

44:01.000 --> 44:29.000
The average age of the shop is over 30 years. Why is this age bar taken as a basis? Because by this period, sociologists and marketers believe that consumers are leading an independent lifestyle, many of them have a family, have higher education, often receive a second higher education, and in this respect their consumption structure of various products and services changes.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
That is why such consumers are called consumers in the active consumer age.

44:35.000 --> 44:58.000
The classification of selection methods. Statistics say that people can be selected. If we put certain statistical procedures in it, we use the so-called random or probability approach.

44:58.000 --> 45:16.000
The random approach is the first method of selection, or the so-called determined, not random approach, based on which the opinion of the researcher is most often based.

45:16.000 --> 45:37.000
I will start with the determined approach. There are four types of selection methods that are used very often, but for each of them they have a non-representative nature, and each of them must be proven to the customer.

45:38.000 --> 45:56.000
The convenience sampling method, the judgmental sampling method, the quota sampling method, where certain quotas or classes of consumers are determined according to certain criteria that must be examined.

45:56.000 --> 46:14.000
Then the approximate ratio of such quotas is determined in the general summary, and the decision is made as to what percentage of the representatives of a given quota should be included in the total selection.

46:14.000 --> 46:39.000
The second method of determining the selection procedure is the random method.

46:39.000 --> 46:55.000
This is when the concept is laid down that each unit of the general summary has an equal chance of being selected. Let's imagine the following situation, the following picture.

46:55.000 --> 47:08.000
Let's say there are 50 people in this audience. If we make a list of these respondents, each of them will be assigned a number, as in the game of the lotto.

47:08.000 --> 47:21.000
The student sitting on the left in the first row will have number 1, the student sitting on the right in the last row will have number 50.

47:21.000 --> 47:36.000
And everyone else will have a number that will be dropped into a special drum or a special basket, where the researcher will accidentally get the numbers.

47:36.000 --> 47:53.000
We need to distribute the information, the opinion of the general summary of all students, for example, on the subject of evaluating the quality of the lecture. It is enough to ask only 10-15 people.

47:53.000 --> 48:09.000
The researcher will take out the numbers of the respondents assigned to the participants of our class from the basket, from the hat, from the bag, and will get 10 or 15 numbers from there.

48:09.000 --> 48:27.000
In principle, everyone has an equal chance of being selected, and at the same time no one knows whose number our researcher will get, because the principle of lotto is used, the principle of random selection is used.

48:27.000 --> 48:43.000
So, the probability random methods are simple random selection, which I told a little about. Each unit of the set has an equal chance of being selected.

48:43.000 --> 48:59.000
The systematic one, that is, a certain step is laid down. For example, we assign units of numbers to the respondents, but at the same time we do not drop them into the hat or into the bag.

48:59.000 --> 49:17.000
We say that we will interview every third student, and then we will also get 15 respondents out of 50, but at the same time we laid down a step of 3 units.

49:17.000 --> 49:36.000
Stratified selection is a selection that is a two-step process. The first step is to divide the whole set into layers or strata, which can intersect with each other or not.

49:36.000 --> 49:53.000
Then we use a simple random approach to interview the same number of respondents from different layers. For example, this year, high school graduates graduated from a school with various biases.

49:53.000 --> 50:21.000
These are mathematical biases, or humanitarian, or economic biases. And all of them intend to continue their education in higher education institutions. We say that these strata intersect with each other, because despite the fact that there were certain biases in the education of these students, nevertheless, in the main general education subjects, their knowledge and strata intersect.

50:21.000 --> 50:40.000
But knowing or assuming that the graduates of physics and mathematics schools will go to technical faculties or technical faculties of universities, and the humanitarians and economists will go to the faculty of psychology or some other humanities faculties and institutes,

50:40.000 --> 50:53.000
you can compare the number of places in these universities with the number of graduates and decide which number of each layer should be chosen by a simple random selection method.

50:53.000 --> 51:16.000
The next selection method differs from the stratified one, and it is called cluster selection. Clusters are selections or layers that do not intersect with each other. For example, the level of education or the level of approaches to the graduates, to the assessment of the graduates, the quality of training of graduates in Moscow or in some different provincial city.

51:16.000 --> 51:33.000
And despite the fact that the general education subjects are approximately the same, nevertheless, the degree of knowledge of foreign languages will be different. Thus, from the point of view of approaches to the study of foreign languages, these clusters will not intersect with each other.

51:46.000 --> 52:00.000
Graduates of capital schools will definitely go to the classes because they realize the importance of the knowledge of foreign languages as a tool for future work, for future careers.

52:16.000 --> 52:41.000
We will use the stratified selection method, when layers are used or strata are determined on the level of income or on the social position of respondents, whose consumer behavior differs, and quotas from a determined complex of selection surveys.

52:41.000 --> 52:58.000
Statistically, we will assume that the number of respondents with an income level starting from $ 1,000 per family member will be located geographically in Moscow.

52:58.000 --> 53:14.000
But with the development of geography and distribution throughout the country, this level of income will fall, and, accordingly, the number of respondents related to this part of the target audience will fall.

53:14.000 --> 53:34.000
The volume of selection is the number of elements that need to be studied. Why did we say that it is enough to study 10-15 people from the general audience in order to determine how their opinion corresponds to the opinion of the general community?

53:34.000 --> 53:48.000
I have already told you that the determined or not random non-probability method of selection does not allow you to objectively assess the accuracy of the results of the study. I will give one example.

53:48.000 --> 54:04.000
The convenience method. Selection is created from the elements that are convenient for selection. For example, I have already told you that we decide that it is easiest to get applicants in front of the doors of different universities.

54:04.000 --> 54:26.000
But at the same time, we will not have a complete picture, because it is easiest to come to the doors of the Plekhanov Academy, which is located near the Serpukhovskaya metro station, in the pedestrian vicinity of the Serpukhovskaya metro station, than to go to the Institute of Culture, which is located geographically in the city of Khimki, the Moscow region.

54:26.000 --> 54:42.000
In this case, we will not understand the difference in preferences, as well as in the assessment of the image of a particular university. Because the selection is made up only of applicants who enter the Plekhanov Academy.

54:42.000 --> 54:59.000
The superficial judgmental selection. The elements of the set are selected based on the judge's judgment. That is, the interviewer decides how many girls and boys should be interviewed from the number of graduates of the schools.

54:59.000 --> 55:22.000
And it is estimated that, for example, out of 150 or 200 people, 60% of girls should be interviewed, because girls always know more, despite the statistical distribution. And 40% of boys should be interviewed. It is quite possible that this judgment of the investigator is not correct.

55:22.000 --> 55:49.000
I have already mentioned the quota selection. The two-stage superficial selection. At the first stage, control groups or general quota are created. And at the second stage, elements of the set are selected based on convenience. For example, students conduct research on their relationship to magazines that are published and see their target audience of teenagers.

55:49.000 --> 56:07.000
And students say that they understand that it is necessary to interview schoolchildren of different ages. Because the teenage age is long, starting from 13 to 19. But the behavior of 13-year-olds is significantly different from the behavior of 19-year-olds.

56:07.000 --> 56:26.000
That is why it is necessary to interview schoolchildren of 6th and 7th grades of high school, 9th and 11th grades of high school and high school graduates. But the students have only one possibility to conduct this research.

56:26.000 --> 56:46.000
They have to explain to the students that all schools are closed, there is no access to students for third-party observers. That is why students establish contacts with schools where they graduated in order to ensure the convenience of behavior.

56:56.000 --> 57:20.000
The last stage is the snow-comb selection. The initial group of respondents is randomly selected. And then they are asked which of the other respondents they know or friends. They can recommend to participate in the survey.

57:20.000 --> 57:39.000
It is clear that it is quite easy to collect the number of such respondents. And at the same time, the selection is shifted to the number of people who share more or less the same views. And so there is not enough variety of information.

57:39.000 --> 57:59.000
Another method of selecting is statistical. As I said, the number of people chosen is random, according to the law of random selection, which ensures representativeness with a known or specified share of probability.

57:59.000 --> 58:25.000
For example, you want to calculate the number of respondents to be surveyed. Before you decide or ask yourself this question, you must ask the statistician or researcher what share of probability or what share of acceptance is taken into account in determining the size of the selection.

58:25.000 --> 58:40.000
The probability method is made up of four basic approaches to selecting. The first is random selection. Each element of the general set has an equal and known probability of being selected.

58:40.000 --> 58:57.000
The second approach is systematic selection. The method is set up by a starting point, and then each element is selected from the selection base.

58:57.000 --> 59:15.000
As I said in our example, we can set a certain step from 50 people present at our lecture. Let's say 3. 3 is a unit that will be added to each previous unit of selection.

59:15.000 --> 59:28.000
The first element will be a participant number 1, plus 3 is number 4, plus 3 is number 7, and so on, until we select 15 elements to survey them.

59:28.000 --> 59:39.000
Stratified selection is a two-step method, in which the general set is divided into layers that can intersect. For example, graduates of schools with different bias, as I said.

59:39.000 --> 59:54.000
And then the elements are selected from each layer based on a simple random selection. That is, each element of this layer, each element of the set from this layer has an equal and known chance of being selected.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The variety of stratified selection is route-based. That is, a route is drawn for an interviewer in a region, such as Moscow, which was once called Sevastopol.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:16.000
A street is chosen, which consists of a number of residential buildings, in order to interview respondents living in this area.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000
For example, Bolotnaya Street. There is a street in the former Sevastopol region, not far from the metro station Khimovsky Prospect.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:47.000
The interviewer is given a step, a layer, that on Bolotnaya Street you need to interview 10 respondents, on a street called Fruktova, which is not far from the metro station, and is also a street that belongs to the former Sevastopol region, you need to interview 10 people.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And in some other area, where there are mostly offices and fewer residential buildings, you need to interview 5 people who live in this area.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Cluster selection differs from stratified by the fact that this is also a two-stage approach, when at first the set is divided into mutually excluding and mutually supplementing subgroups, clusters, for example, residents who live in different regions.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Moscow and Moscow region, their consumer behavior will differ, in particular, what stores they mainly prefer.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Then, elements of the set are selected from these clusters, which are selected using a simple random selection, based on some knowledge, data, about the consumption of a particular product or visiting a particular shopping center.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Further, after determining the methods of random selection, it is necessary to think about how to calculate the size of the selection, how many respondents are needed and enough to ask in order to prove to the customer of the study that the information obtained using the selection method is representative and reflects the real position of things.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Moreover, this information can be extrapolated or distributed to the entire general set, which was not surveyed, but was surveyed only by its representatives, some number of its representatives.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:43.000
For this purpose, you can work with a table of simple random numbers. Of the total of 300 units numbered in advance, 7 units of observation must be selected, and n is a large three-digit number, and the table gives five-digit numbers.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:03:04.000
We will use only the last numbers from this table. For example, 7 units of the end of each number by the number 7. 97, 297, 209, 13, 157. These are the numbers of observation that fall into the selected selection.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:23.000
The most common task is to evaluate the average value of the signs of the general set, which is evaluated, for example, we need to determine the average number of newspapers and magazines that are issued by business school employees or institute employees.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:45.000
The basis of the selection is a list of all units of selection, all employees of the institute or business school. Alphabetical list, which is numbered in sequence. Number 1 is the name of the person who starts with the letter A, and the number of some of the employees who start with the letter Y.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:58.000
The calculation of the characteristics of a simple random selection. We have 50 units of the general set, the number of newspapers that are issued, which is characteristic of each of these numbers.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The basis of the selection is 50 units. The number of newspapers that are issued, when we multiply and add up the numbers, will be 150 newspapers and magazines, which are issued by newspaper employees.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:38.000
If we talk about the number of newspapers and magazines that are issued per subscriber, then by simply dividing 150 newspapers by 50, the person in the selection receives an arithmetic value of 3.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:55.000
In this case, we have a certain concept of variation that characterizes the magnitude of similarity or inlikeliness of answers to a certain question. For example, someone does not issue newspapers at all, and someone issues 3 magazines, and someone issues only one.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:08.000
As a measure of variation, the average square deviation is taken, in our case, 1.7. The definition of the investigated quantities for the totality is determined on the basis of the selection statistics.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Therefore, we should establish a range or a certain confidence interval in which the value of the square deviation will fall. What is a confidence interval? How is it related to the concept of reliability or the level of reliability?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:46.000
A confidence interval is a range in which the true value of the studied parameter of the total is determined, given the level of reliability. For example, a range, the extreme point of which corresponds to a certain percentage of certain answers to a question.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:06:02.000
For example, out of 50 people, 10% report that they do not issue newspapers at all, and 15% report that they issue an average of 3 newspapers and magazines.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The confidence interval corresponds to 95 or 99%. What does 95% mean? It means that with an accuracy of plus or minus 5, we can say that the number of respondents we are interviewing will give us knowledge that can be distributed to the entire general population.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:55.000
If we use a 99% confidence interval, it means that the number of respondents with an accuracy of plus or minus 1, their opinion and knowledge will be distributed to the entire general population.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Where can we find the correlation of the probability integral of this confidence interval? The numbers 1.96 and 2.58 for a 99% confidence interval are denoted as Z.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:31.000
In our workbook, in the conspective, or in any other textbook on sociological or marketing research, there are tables that are called the probability integral values for determining the Z value for various confidence intervals.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I repeat that the standard confidence intervals are 95% plus or minus 5, with an accuracy of plus or minus 5. We decide that our information and our choice, the opinion of this choice, is distributed to the entire general population, or 99%.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:16.000
If we talk about the optimal size of the choice, there are many different formulas, but the most common and widely used formula, in which the indicators of the dispersion of the sign are used and taken into account, or the expected average deviation of the results from the expected average value,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:39.000
n is the expected value of the Z choice, the level of reliability coefficient, in this case we round 1.96 or 2. 1.96 is rounded to 2 for a 95% confidence interval, and 3 instead of 2.58 for a 0.99 confidence interval.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:56.000
The indicator d means the level of reliability. Let's consider this choice, the calculation of the optimal size of the choice, for example. Let's say we study the behavior of the buyer in a grocery store. In particular, it is necessary to determine the average amount of the check.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The shop owner, who is in this case, as an expert, says that the average amount of the check can be about 500-700 rubles, and the average deviation or sigma can be 200 rubles. This means that the average deviation from 700 or 500 rubles can be 200 rubles.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:30.000
During the survey, it would be desirable to determine the average value with an accuracy of d, with an accuracy of up to 20 rubles at the level of Z reliability at 0.95.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:52.000
The formula for the optimal size of the choice is the product of the squares of the degree of reliability to the degree of the integral value of the probability in the square divided by the square of the value of reliability.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:08.000
n is the primary volume of the choice, sigma is the dispersion of the sign, the expected average deviation of the obtained results, z is the coefficient of the level of reliability. I repeat that we round 1.96 to 2 and 2.58 for 3.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:29.000
We get 40,000 multiplied by 4. 40,000 is the value of the number of dispersions of the sign, multiplied by 4. 2 in the square divided by 400 is 400.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:51.000
That is, it is necessary and sufficient to ask 400 buyers. But we take into account that some surveys may be distorted or spoiled by the interviewer or the respondent himself, so it is desirable to increase the number of respondents to 420-450 surveys.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:10.000
If we wanted to find out the average amount of the check with an accuracy of up to 10 rubles, we would have to ask 1,600 buyers. If we wanted to get a level of reliability not at 0.95, but at 0.99, the number of buyers to be asked would be 3,500.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:28.000
If we were satisfied with an accuracy of plus or minus 50 rubles, it would be enough to ask only 65 people in the given conditions. Note that 65 people, based on the concept of a random approach, is not enough.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:47.000
1,600 or 3,500 people are not enough to be asked, because such volumes of the selection examination will take time and, most importantly, will be expensive. That is why we will stop at the number that means 400 people.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:16.000
How is this done in practice? It is believed that surveys of 30-50 representatives of a specific narrow audience, for example, married Muscovites aged 30-45, who have one child, higher education and total income within 700-1,500 dollars per month, can be distributed to the entire group, and the permissible error or trust interval will not exceed 4% at a level of reliability of 0.95%.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Thus, 30-50 people are enough to spread this opinion to the entire general community, that is, married Muscovites of a certain age, working and living in Moscow.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:46.000
If the research is aimed at obtaining information on the opinions, knowledge, behavior, attitude to a certain problem of all Muscovites, it is necessary to build a selection in which all narrow groups of strata would be represented.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:13:08.000
We talked about stratified selection. For example, two strata on the family situation, married or not married, three on the presence and number of children, three adult, three income, two educational, a total of 108 groups or strata, each of which should have at least 30 respondents, a total of more than 3,000 respondents.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:27.000
However, if you take into account the concept of a selection survey, it is enough to deal with a volume of 400-600 respondents, and then to carry out a so-called dual-factor analysis of the influence of age, education, income, family situation.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:41.000
At the same time, the selection is divided into 2-3 groups, each of which has at least 100-150 respondents. An example that I borrowed from the book by Igor Berezin.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Representative selection of the population of Russia. 3,600-9,000 people and 180 groups of strata, 2 sexes, 3 ages, 2 educational levels, 3 income groups, 5 types of settlements in which respondents live.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The trust interval will be within the range of plus or minus 3 percentage points. This means that if 30%, that is, from 12% to 45% of respondents, stated that they regularly consume mayonnaise, then the share of mayonnaise consumers in Russia can be estimated at 27-33%.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Or to consider that 9-15% of 3% or 42-48% of 5% consume mayonnaise in Russia.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:58.000
If we talk about conducting marketing research, it is important to remember that the size of the selection does not depend on the size of the overall population. For example, in a metropolis with a population of 1 million people or in a rural city of 35,000 people, when constructing a selection, representative by the same number of parameters, it is necessary to ask for the same number of people.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And to achieve representativeness by 5 parameters, sex, age, income, education in the field of professional activity, it is possible only in the selection of 1,000-1,200 people in one settlement, regardless of the number of people living in this settlement.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I propose to answer the question. If you are a representative of the Lyubidyan company, a juice producer, and you need to survey the population of cities with a population of more than 100,000 people, what type of survey should be used to obtain information about 1,000-1,200 people in each city?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:05.000
As I said, experimental studies are carried out at the most advanced stages, which, based on their essence, use the cause-effect relationship.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The cause-effect relationship means that the X event increases the Y event, and there is a cause-effect relationship between them. For example, increasing the cost of a product by 10% affects the sales volume.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:46.000
This is often negatively influenced. On the contrary, a 10% discount increases sales. At the same time, we say that such discounts and such experiments are not typical for all products.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:17:00.000
A 10% discount will be perceived skeptically by consumers of the luxury category, or a 10% discount will seem too low for the sale of the previous fashion collection.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:21.000
The condition for the existence of a cause-effect relationship, which requires that the degree of joint advance or joint variation of the X event and the Y event, is recognized by the initial hypothesis of the existence of a cause-effect relationship, about the relationship between these events.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:32.000
For example, the initial hypothesis can be the hypothesis formulated as follows for conducting experimental studies.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Tactile or grafting information obtained through the grafting organs, through the organs of the subject's testing, can increase sales via the Internet and catalogs.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Tactile information can increase sales via the Internet by 15%, and tactile information will not affect sales via the Internet at all.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I mean if the product is presented on the Internet or in the catalog. That is, there is a presence of the product in the unprocessed trade when there are no consumers, a seller who can tell about our product.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:40.000
For example, a mobile phone. How easy will this product be sold and how much will its sales increase if the seller or manufacturer, in addition to technical characteristics, adds an emotional characteristic of describing this product from the point of view of obtaining tactile information from consumers.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:56.000
For example, that the phone is easy to put in your hand, that it has a very pleasant and high-quality material that warms or cools the hand of the owner of this mobile phone in the coolness, and so on.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:04.000
In addition to technical characteristics, such emotional attributes can become extremely important in unprocessed sales.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:16.000
For example, we can catch the corresponding variation between the purchase of fashionable clothes and the level of education. Pay attention to this slide and the slide that follows it.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:31.000
The purchase of fashionable clothes may depend on the level of education, higher and middle, and the purchase of fashionable clothes, high and low, means a high degree of purchase variation and a low degree of purchase variation.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:51.000
However, we do not see a difference between the influence of the income level of a person who has a high or middle education, the influence on his behavior in the process of buying fashionable clothes, which can be identified by experimental studies.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:03.000
For example, the purchase of fashionable clothes, the following slide, and the ratio of the indicators of the level of income and education and its influence on the purchase of fashionable clothes.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:32.000
In the first case, we see that people with higher education, 61% of the respondents, and with a high income level are more likely to purchase fashionable clothes than respondents with the same level of education, but with lower incomes.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:47.000
The main definitions of the units of observation that are included in the experimental study are people, organizations, individual consumers, or other observable objects whose reaction to independent factors is to be studied.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Experimental studies have come to marketing from fundamental studies, where they are often used to study the influence of pharmaceutical drugs on the health of subjects.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:37.000
The experiment is primarily a controlled process of changing one or more independent variables to measure their influence on one or more dependent variables, provided that the influence of third-party factors is excluded.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Please note that we introduce the concept of marketing, including or providing a 10% discount to a particular consumer on a particular type of product.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Or some other factors, such as the case factor or the place factor, can have a strong influence on decision-making.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Thus, experimental studies in marketing are carried out either in natural conditions, where the consumer and the product or the consumer and the service meet, or in laboratory artificial conditions, where the situation of natural market conditions is imitated and the consumer is offered to try the product, assess its quality,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:50.000
to arrange the degree of importance of a particular factor or parameter of the product that affects the consumer's decision to buy.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:04.000
If we talk about the classification of the model of the experiment, it is in the general form of four groups of experimental studies, which are combined into four large types or clusters.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:25.000
The first is a preliminary experiment, the second is a real experiment, the third is a pseudo-experiment, and the fourth is a statistical experiment.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:50.000
For example, a preliminary experiment model is also called a single-time study. The model, in which the basic factor, for example, the condition X, is the only group of observations, and then a single measurement of factors is carried out, a feature called only the subsequent analysis, after only.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:06.000
For example, phone surveys are conducted with respondents on television programs shown the day before, which include a certain commercial video. As a dependent variable, the ability to remember this video without asking questions is present.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:26.000
When a statement is made, questions about the content are asked. That is, the respondents who watched the TV program the day before, yesterday, should answer whether they remember or not, or should remember what commercial video they watched.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:39.000
The problem of reliability in this case is obvious. Either the respondents can not remember the commercial video at all, or there is no basis for comparison with the previous respondents.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:56.000
The next type of experimental study is a preliminary and final study within one experimental group. It is called One Group Pre-test-Post-test. This is a model of preliminary experiments, in which a unit of observations in an experimental group is measured twice.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Respondents are selected for testing in research centers in different cities of the country. A personal survey is conducted to determine the perception of a particular product. Then they watch a TV video in which the commercial video of this product is included.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:34.000
After watching, a personal survey is conducted again, and the effectiveness of the test ads is assessed as the difference in the perception of a TV program with an included commercial video in relation to this product without watching the commercial video.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:54.000
The next type of experimental study is a static group model. This is a preliminary experiment model, which involves the use of two experimental groups of respondents, the main and the control group. Both assess the influence of an independent factor and an independent factor.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Two groups of respondents are selected according to the researcher's opinion. A TV program with a commercial video is shown to only one group of respondents. Then the perception of the product is measured by both the main and the control groups.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:29.000
The effectiveness of the ad is assessed as the difference between the perception of the control group and the perception of the main group. Or vice versa, if this is a negative expression, the perception of the product or the perception of the ad of the main group to the perception of the control group, which the video was not shown.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:45.000
The models of an actual experiment are tested by a post-test control group. The experimental group is affected by an independent factor, and the control group is not. Preliminary and final measurements are carried out in both groups.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:27:07.000
The first group of respondents fills out a questionnaire to determine their preliminary attitude to the product. Preliminary testing of the attitude to the product is carried out.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Then only the experimental group is shown a commercial video. After that, both groups are asked to fill out a questionnaire to measure their attitude to the product.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:41.000
If the change in perception of the product under the influence of the commercial video, which was seen by the members of the experimental group, increases, this means that such a video will affect the behavior of the consumers and representatives of the target audience of the product.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:59.000
The models of an actual experiment are presented in the form of experimental studies, which refer to the concept of 4 groups of Solomon.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:27.000

The factors that limit the possibility of an experiment are time, costs and the possibility of implementation.

Where are the experimental studies conducted?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Other manufacturers have launched new products. Autumn is the most promising time of the year.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:27.000
However, the company did not pay attention to this, the product was launched, and due to the fact that the negative results of the experimental studies were not taken into account, the company suffered losses in terms of the failure to meet the planned sales figures.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Thus, the topic of experimental studies is over. Before we proceed to the next topic, I would like to ask you a question about how effective and difficult it is to organize experimental market studies in marketing.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Today we have listened to a lecture on the creation, implementation and analysis of data for a marketing project, which is based on effective management decisions.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:31.000
We have listened to the topic of the concept of conducting research, determining the problems of marketing research, determining the necessary methods and tools for collecting and analyzing marketing information.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:55.000
We have listened to the information about how the marketing information system is developed in the company, from which blocks and components it consists, and how it can be used by employees of various management departments of the company to make decisions.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:14.000
The next topic was the quality research projects, where we considered possible types of quality research, deep interviews, focus groups and indirect methods of quality research, which are called design technologies.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Next, we moved on to the topic of quantitative research, obtaining primary information from respondents on a quantitative scale, where we considered various types and methods of surveys, using various tools for conducting surveys, creating surveys.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Next, we considered the basis of measurements in marketing research, the measurement of relations, emotions, the measurement of factors that affect the behavior of consumers and buyers.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:13.000
We also considered the basis of qualitative research, from the point of view of determining the methods of selection and from the point of view of determining the volumes of selection that are necessary for collecting information.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:37.000
We also considered experimental marketing research, for example, how static groups or pseudo-experiments can be used, and finally, we figured out how to present a good, effective report on the conduct of marketing research in writing and in oral form.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:40:05.000
As part of today's course, there is a large number of methods and techniques that you will study in future courses, which relate to what specific techniques from the listed ones can be used to assess, for example, the determination of product parameters in order to create a product concept that is most in demand by consumers.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:19.000
It remains to consider the issue of assessing the sensitivity of consumers to price, at what price consumers will buy or refuse a product offered on the market.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:48.000
It remains to consider the issue of decision-making in the field of distribution, in order to calculate and determine possible parameters for optimizing transport costs or any other marketing costs for the presentation of products in the distribution channel or in various retail and wholesale trading networks.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I wish you success in further study of marketing research and other disciplines in the field of marketing that will bring you knowledge on how to collect, analyze, interpret information and how to make effective decisions based on this information obtained by conducting marketing research.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
All the best!
