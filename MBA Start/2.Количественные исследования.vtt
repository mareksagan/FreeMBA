00:00.000 --> 00:13.160
At the moment, we will move on to the next topic of our course, namely, linear programming.

00:13.160 --> 00:21.240
Let's start a little bit from afar. Imagine that you need to solve an equation, a solution that you

00:21.240 --> 00:27.040
cannot imagine. Well, let's say that you forgot the math course, and you want to solve the equation,

00:27.040 --> 00:34.440
for example, the form of cosine x is equal to sine x. The solution is quite simple, there are two angles, 45

00:34.440 --> 00:47.520
plus 180 would be 225 degrees, or in terms of pi, it is pi by 4, and, accordingly, pi plus pi by 4. But let's say

00:47.520 --> 00:55.880
that you forgot the math course and want to solve this equation. Can modern tools help you,

00:55.880 --> 01:01.480
for example, the Excel program? Yes, they can. Excel has a function called parameter selection,

01:01.480 --> 01:09.800
or in English goal seek. With its help, you can select one variable so that your equation is solved.

01:09.800 --> 01:15.320
Goal seek or parameter selection allows you to solve almost all equations. Unfortunately,

01:15.320 --> 01:22.200
this equation is only one variable, and there can be any degree, any complexity, but, alas,

01:22.320 --> 01:28.520
as I said, only one variable. There are some subtleties when solving such problems, but nevertheless.

01:28.520 --> 01:36.280
As an example, we will now see how to solve the equation sine x is equal to cosine x with the help of goal seek.

01:36.280 --> 01:45.160
As I said, the solution of the simplest equations is possible in the search function. Let's try.

01:45.880 --> 01:52.600
We have a simple equation sine x is equal to cosine x.

01:52.600 --> 01:59.000
Well, of course, in order to solve it in Excel, you will need to write it a little differently.

01:59.000 --> 02:14.440
Okay, so, we will call one of our cells x. We will set the value one there for now. We will call it x.

02:14.440 --> 02:21.740
Well, as you can see, yes, that is, since we have a sine of one minus a cosine of one is equal to zero

02:21.740 --> 02:24.460
Future

02:51.820 --> 03:09.440
The solution helps choose the correct cell for performing the penultimate equation listing.

03:10.440 --> 03:16.940
As you can see, XL is not 0, but it's 0.002.

03:16.940 --> 03:18.440
It's almost 0.

03:18.440 --> 03:26.940
If you want, you can change the accuracy and check the solution with a higher accuracy.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.940
As we expected, the solution is approximately pi by 2.

03:30.940 --> 03:34.440
Let's check it. I'll multiply this number by 4.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.940
Sorry, not by 4, of course.

03:35.940 --> 03:39.940
I'll multiply it by 4 and see what it is. Yes, 3, 3, 14.

03:39.940 --> 03:43.940
It should be 1, 5, 9 in the real pi.

03:45.940 --> 03:53.940
Now, if we set another initial value, for example, 5,

03:53.940 --> 03:59.940
we will get a completely different solution for this equation.

04:00.940 --> 04:01.940
Let's try.

04:06.440 --> 04:15.940
Data, analysis, what if, parameter selection, set cell C5, value equal to 0, change value of cell C4.

04:15.940 --> 04:16.940
OK.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.940
As you can see, we got a different value.

04:19.940 --> 04:25.940
And no matter what initial value we started with, or rather, not so,

04:25.940 --> 04:31.940
since equations have many solutions, there are two pi periodic, or rather, pi periodic solutions,

04:31.940 --> 04:38.940
then starting with different initial values, we will get different solutions.

04:39.940 --> 04:40.940
OK.

04:40.940 --> 04:46.940
Let's move on to more serious tasks, tasks of several variables.

04:47.940 --> 04:52.940
OK, we've seen how simple equations are solved by parameter selection.

04:52.940 --> 04:55.940
It's time to talk about more difficult tasks.

04:55.940 --> 04:58.940
Of course, tasks in life are much more difficult, most often.

04:58.940 --> 05:03.940
And another function of Excel will help us with this,

05:03.940 --> 05:09.940
namely, it's called solution search, or solver in English.

05:10.940 --> 05:13.940
In fact, a solver, or rather, solution search,

05:13.940 --> 05:19.940
is a program that allows you to implement linear programming on Excel.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.940
What is linear programming?

05:22.940 --> 05:26.940
Linear programming is a search for an optimal solution

05:26.940 --> 05:34.940
in a situation when your initial data is limited.

05:35.940 --> 05:40.940
Limited not in the sense that you don't have enough data,

05:40.940 --> 05:44.940
but in the sense that you impose a limit, for example,

05:44.940 --> 05:47.940
you want to make the bathroom at home as big as possible,

05:47.940 --> 05:50.940
but its depth should not be more than one meter.

05:50.940 --> 05:53.940
This is an example of a typical limitation.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.940
The previous function that we discussed, goal seek,

05:59.940 --> 06:01.940
does not allow you to impose a limit.

06:01.940 --> 06:07.940
In addition, it allows you to solve tasks with only one variable.

06:07.940 --> 06:13.940
A solver allows you to work with functions of many variables.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.940
Of course, we understand that, for example,

06:15.940 --> 06:18.940
the value of the enterprise is always a function of many variables.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.940
This is a function of, I don't know,

06:20.940 --> 06:22.940
the cost, the cost of sale,

06:22.940 --> 06:27.940
the number of sales in the nominal expression,

06:27.940 --> 06:33.940
the function of our constant variables, variables, and so on.

06:34.940 --> 06:37.940
A solver allows you to work with a large number of functions.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.940
To be fair, I must say that not always and not everywhere,

06:41.940 --> 06:45.940
but nevertheless, a solver is a much more advanced tool.

06:45.940 --> 06:49.940
In addition, a solver allows two-dimensional and whole variables.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.940
You can't sell 2.3 cars, for example.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.940
You sell either two or three.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.940
In this regard, to be honest,

06:57.940 --> 07:00.940
whole variables in a solver work poorly,

07:00.940 --> 07:03.940
but it's better than nothing.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.940
After all, it's the only available,

07:06.940 --> 07:08.940
in fact, really available,

07:08.940 --> 07:11.940
solution to the linear programming problem.

07:11.940 --> 07:16.940
In addition, a solver offers things like solution analysis.

07:16.940 --> 07:19.940
We'll look at an example now,

07:19.940 --> 07:21.940
but for now we can say that,

07:21.940 --> 07:23.940
for example, such a task.

07:23.940 --> 07:28.940
You perform, like the following task,

07:28.940 --> 07:30.940
you produce a mixture of nuts,

07:30.940 --> 07:33.940
and you run out of one of the types of nuts.

07:33.940 --> 07:35.940
A person comes and asks,

07:35.940 --> 07:38.940
I know you're out of such nuts,

07:38.940 --> 07:40.940
for example, a hazelnut,

07:40.940 --> 07:42.940
but do you want to take it,

07:42.940 --> 07:44.940
but it's a half price more than you usually take.

07:44.940 --> 07:46.940
And you need to understand whether it's beneficial or not.

07:46.940 --> 07:49.940
Can you afford to buy this nut,

07:49.940 --> 07:52.940
so that you stay within your cost,

07:52.940 --> 07:55.940
so that your loss does not decrease,

07:55.940 --> 07:57.940
so that you do not get into losses.

07:58.940 --> 08:03.940
At the same time, a solver can be used,

08:03.940 --> 08:06.940
what is interesting, can be used in macros.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.940
If there is time, I can show you

08:08.940 --> 08:10.940
how macros work in Excel.

08:10.940 --> 08:15.940
And a solver allows you to use various search methods.

08:15.940 --> 08:19.940
At the same time, what is the problem?

08:19.940 --> 08:22.940
Solver, well, imagine,

08:22.940 --> 08:25.940
I will show this with my hand,

08:25.940 --> 08:27.940
imagine this function,

08:27.940 --> 08:29.940
which has two minimums,

08:29.940 --> 08:31.940
the main minimum and the second minimum,

08:31.940 --> 08:33.940
smaller, on the contrary, larger.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.940
Having entered the second small minimum,

08:36.940 --> 08:38.940
which is not global,

08:38.940 --> 08:40.940
but a local minimum,

08:40.940 --> 08:42.940
a solver will not be able to get out of it,

08:42.940 --> 08:44.940
because it does not search,

08:44.940 --> 08:47.940
like a goose, it does not go through the variable,

08:47.940 --> 08:50.940
it just looks for the derivative

08:50.940 --> 08:52.940
and looks where it should go next.

08:52.940 --> 08:54.940
If it gets into a hole,

08:54.940 --> 08:57.940
it will never get out of this hole.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.940
Well, accordingly,

08:59.940 --> 09:02.940
since it cannot get out of it,

09:02.940 --> 09:04.940
it needs help,

09:04.940 --> 09:06.940
the initial value of the variables must be shifted

09:06.940 --> 09:09.940
so that it is on the other side of the small hole.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.940
We will talk in more detail about the type of limitation,

09:12.940 --> 09:14.940
the existing type of limitation,

09:14.940 --> 09:16.940
when we solve the problem,

09:16.940 --> 09:19.940
but in principle there is a limitation on the budget.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.940
This is when you are preparing,

09:21.940 --> 09:23.940
for example, to spend money on the New Year,

09:23.940 --> 09:26.940
and you think how much you have to buy,

09:26.940 --> 09:29.940
and at the same time you understand

09:29.940 --> 09:32.940
that your budget is limited to,

09:32.940 --> 09:35.940
let's say, three or five thousand rubles.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.940
There are limitations on non-negativity,

09:38.940 --> 09:40.940
for example,

09:40.940 --> 09:43.940
let's say you are a metallurgical company,

09:43.940 --> 09:45.940
you produce alloys,

09:45.940 --> 09:48.940
if you sell a negative amount of some alloy,

09:48.940 --> 09:51.940
it means that you buy this alloy,

09:51.940 --> 09:54.940
you disassemble it into components

09:54.940 --> 09:56.940
and use it in others.

09:56.940 --> 09:58.940
This is probably not very correct.

09:58.940 --> 10:01.940
The limitation can be there at extreme risk,

10:01.940 --> 10:03.940
and as I said,

10:03.940 --> 10:05.940
there can be a limitation on the whole,

10:05.940 --> 10:07.940
non-whole, and so on,

10:07.940 --> 10:09.940
on the double, non-double, and so on.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.940
Let's talk about using the solver right now.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.940
Let's consider the following task.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.940
You work, you own a company

10:15.940 --> 10:18.940
that produces a mixture of nuts.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.940
The nuts are called

10:21.940 --> 10:24.940
nut-nut-plus-premium-lux,

10:24.940 --> 10:27.940
and they consist of the corresponding number

10:27.940 --> 10:30.940
of different types of nuts.

10:33.940 --> 10:35.940
Here, in this line,

10:35.940 --> 10:38.940
the number of nuts in the percentage

10:38.940 --> 10:41.940
of the components of this mixture is indicated,

10:41.940 --> 10:43.940
of course, in weight percentages.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.940
If you look,

10:45.940 --> 10:48.940
each line will be 100.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.940
Check it, make sure of it,

10:50.940 --> 10:52.940
so you don't doubt it.

10:52.940 --> 10:54.940
The sum is 100.

10:55.940 --> 11:00.940
The mixture is sold at different prices.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.940
You have a certain number

11:05.940 --> 11:07.940
of different types of nuts on the slot,

11:07.940 --> 11:09.940
you have a purchase price,

11:09.940 --> 11:12.940
and you want to maximize,

11:12.940 --> 11:14.940
let's call it a profit.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.940
It's not exactly a profit,

11:16.940 --> 11:19.940
because you still have operational costs,

11:19.940 --> 11:21.940
and so on.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.940
But in this case, let's call it

11:23.940 --> 11:25.940
an operational profit.

11:25.940 --> 11:27.940
In short, we'll call it a profit.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.940
Again, you buy peanuts for $2 per kilo of hazelnuts,

11:30.940 --> 11:33.940
for $3, for Brazilian nuts for $2, and so on.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.940
The most expensive nut is cedar,

11:35.940 --> 11:38.940
the most expensive mixture is lux.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.940
The number of nuts on the slot

11:41.940 --> 11:43.940
is completely different.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.940
What do we do next?

11:45.940 --> 11:47.940
We will change the production

11:47.940 --> 11:49.940
of our mixtures in this way.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.940
Look, if I put another number here,

11:52.940 --> 11:55.940
you will see how the number of nuts

11:55.940 --> 11:58.940
used in the line changes.

11:58.940 --> 12:01.940
For example, I put number 10 here,

12:01.940 --> 12:05.940
and we have a change in the growth rate.

12:05.940 --> 12:08.940
And we have a change in the growth rate

12:08.940 --> 12:10.940
of peanuts, of course,

12:10.940 --> 12:13.940
because we added 9 kilograms of nuts

12:13.940 --> 12:15.940
to the production mixture.

12:15.940 --> 12:17.940
Accordingly, 9 kilograms of new peanut

12:17.940 --> 12:20.940
consumption gives us 4.2 additional.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.940
And, for example, to demonstrate again,

12:23.940 --> 12:26.940
I will add another 10 kilograms

12:26.940 --> 12:29.940
of production in the lux mixture,

12:29.940 --> 12:32.940
and we will expect that now we will not need

12:32.940 --> 12:35.940
300 grams of nuts, as it was before,

12:35.940 --> 12:38.940
but 2.3 kilograms of nuts.

12:38.940 --> 12:40.940
So it is.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.940
Now pay attention,

12:42.940 --> 12:44.940
here in these three cells

12:44.940 --> 12:46.940
our sales are calculated.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.940
Sales are simply the sum of

12:48.940 --> 12:50.940
the paired products,

12:50.940 --> 12:53.940
the price of sales per production.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.940
Here the function XL is used,

12:56.940 --> 12:58.940
the sum of sales,

12:59.940 --> 13:03.940
it has an English name.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.940
Accordingly, our costs are also considered

13:08.940 --> 13:11.940
as the sum of sales,

13:11.940 --> 13:15.940
as the price per use of the corresponding

13:15.940 --> 13:19.940
quantity of the corresponding nut.

13:19.940 --> 13:22.940
And, of course, our profit is considered

13:22.940 --> 13:25.940
as the difference between our sales

13:25.940 --> 13:27.940
and our costs.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.940
We want to use the function,

13:31.940 --> 13:34.940
or rather the XL overhaul,

13:34.940 --> 13:37.940
which is called the search for a solution.

13:37.940 --> 13:39.940
In order to use it,

13:39.940 --> 13:41.940
you need to install it first.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.940
You should probably turn to your manual,

13:44.940 --> 13:46.940
that is, to the reference system,

13:46.940 --> 13:48.940
because in different versions

13:48.940 --> 13:51.940
it happens in several different ways.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.940
Most likely, if the overhaul is not installed,

13:54.940 --> 13:57.940
and by default it is not installed,

13:57.940 --> 14:00.940
you will need to resort to the help

14:00.940 --> 14:03.940
of your distributive disk.

14:04.940 --> 14:07.940
Okay, we want to use

14:07.940 --> 14:10.940
the search for a solution.

14:16.940 --> 14:20.940
What is the conclusion of this function?

14:21.940 --> 14:25.940
It asks what target function we want to see.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.940
First of all, we choose the target function

14:28.940 --> 14:30.940
and the target profit.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.940
As we agreed,

14:32.940 --> 14:34.940
as it is known,

14:34.940 --> 14:36.940
the purpose of any company

14:36.940 --> 14:38.940
is to get its profits

14:38.940 --> 14:40.940
by exploiting people.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.940
We will maximize the profit

14:43.940 --> 14:46.940
by changing the production.

14:46.940 --> 14:49.940
We will have to impose certain restrictions

14:49.940 --> 14:52.940
on the consumption of our nuts,

14:52.940 --> 14:54.940
because we understand

14:54.940 --> 14:57.940
that we cannot consume peanuts

14:57.940 --> 14:59.940
more than 300 kg

14:59.940 --> 15:02.940
and cedar nuts more than 100 kg.

15:02.940 --> 15:06.940
These are so-called budget restrictions.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.940
In addition,

15:14.940 --> 15:16.940
we will now see

15:16.940 --> 15:19.940
that we will need other restrictions.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.940
We clicked the Execute button.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.940
At the same time,

15:28.940 --> 15:32.940
Excel gives us an optimal solution.

15:32.940 --> 15:35.940
Okay, let's see what happened.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.940
We have a negative value

15:38.940 --> 15:41.940
in the production graph.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.940
What does this mean?

15:45.940 --> 15:48.940
From the point of view of Excel,

15:48.940 --> 15:51.940
from the point of view of its implementation

15:51.940 --> 15:53.940
of linear programming,

15:53.940 --> 15:56.940
we can buy a peanut mixture,

15:56.940 --> 15:59.940
disassemble it into component parts

15:59.940 --> 16:02.940
and use it in practice.

16:02.940 --> 16:05.940
We probably won't like it,

16:05.940 --> 16:09.940
so I suggest adding another restriction.

16:09.940 --> 16:11.940
It is clear that our production

16:11.940 --> 16:13.940
should not be less than zero.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.940
Let's run the search again.

16:16.940 --> 16:19.940
You will see that the numbers of the new solution

16:19.940 --> 16:21.940
will differ significantly.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.940
We will add another restriction.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.940
Click the Add button.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.940
Link to cell.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.940
Here you can use block links.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.940
Not less than or equal to,

16:36.940 --> 16:39.940
but more than or equal to zero.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.940
Pay attention to the drop-down menu.

16:42.940 --> 16:44.940
Less than or equal to,

16:44.940 --> 16:46.940
more than or equal to,

16:46.940 --> 16:48.940
whole or double.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.940
It is best to use less than or equal to,

16:51.940 --> 16:53.940
less than or equal to,

16:53.940 --> 16:55.940
or more than or equal to.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.940
Whole increases the size of the problem.

16:58.940 --> 17:01.940
Excel will take much longer

17:01.940 --> 17:04.940
to sort out its solution.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.940
The sign is equal.

17:06.940 --> 17:08.940
It is a very tough sign.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.940
Excel will have a much harder time

17:11.940 --> 17:14.940
solving the problem.

17:14.940 --> 17:17.940
We will talk about how to solve it later.

17:17.940 --> 17:21.940
For now, let's use the search function again.

17:28.940 --> 17:30.940
As you can see,

17:30.940 --> 17:33.940
Excel gave us a zero.

17:33.940 --> 17:36.940
It won't change anything.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.940
What happened?

17:41.940 --> 17:44.940
We ran out of hazelnuts.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.940
We ran out of cedar nuts.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.940
It turned out that the margin

17:50.940 --> 17:53.940
for the sale of the nut mix

17:53.940 --> 17:56.940
Lux is quite high.

17:56.940 --> 17:59.940
All the others.

17:59.940 --> 18:02.940
We ran out of cedar nuts,

18:02.940 --> 18:05.940
and at the same time we ran out of hazelnuts.

18:06.940 --> 18:10.940
Since the hazelnut is a part of all the nuts,

18:10.940 --> 18:13.940
we can't sell anything else.

18:13.940 --> 18:17.940
Let's try to start with a few other initial conditions

18:17.940 --> 18:20.940
to see what happens

18:20.940 --> 18:23.940
if we had more hazelnuts.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.940
Then we will come to the conclusion

18:26.940 --> 18:29.940
that some other nut will run out.

18:29.940 --> 18:33.940
The hazelnut should not be the first to run out.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.940
Let's run the search again.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.940
Sometimes it takes some time.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.940
Pay attention.

18:48.940 --> 18:52.940
Now not all sales are related to cedar nuts.

18:57.940 --> 19:01.940
As you can see, cedar nuts are used completely.

19:02.940 --> 19:05.940
This is normal.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.940
Pecan is used completely.

19:14.940 --> 19:17.940
Then the following task arises.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.940
Imagine that you are in a situation

19:20.940 --> 19:23.940
when you run out of pecan,

19:23.940 --> 19:26.940
and you run out of cedar nuts.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.940
Someone comes to you

19:30.940 --> 19:33.940
and offers to buy 200 kg of pecan,

19:33.940 --> 19:36.940
but not for $ 4 per kg,

19:36.940 --> 19:39.940
but for $ 8 per kg.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.940
Yes, the price is higher than your usual price,

19:42.940 --> 19:45.940
but on the other hand,

19:45.940 --> 19:48.940
while you have no pecan,

19:48.940 --> 19:51.940
if you can't get it anywhere on the market,

19:51.940 --> 19:54.940
you can't produce any more nuts.

19:54.940 --> 19:57.940
How to solve this problem?

19:58.940 --> 20:01.940
Is it worth buying twice as much?

20:01.940 --> 20:04.940
It turns out that Excel gives us this answer.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.940
Let's run the search again.

20:14.940 --> 20:17.940
And we will ask Excel

20:17.940 --> 20:20.940
to choose stability as a type of report.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.940
Pay attention.

20:30.940 --> 20:33.940
I don't know why Microsoft chose the name

20:33.940 --> 20:36.940
for this graph,

20:36.940 --> 20:39.940
but the name is much more intuitive.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.940
It is Shadow Price.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.940
Before such a price,

20:45.940 --> 20:48.940
you should be ready to pay

20:48.940 --> 20:51.940
for 1 kg of pecan,

20:51.940 --> 20:54.940
and then you can buy

20:54.940 --> 20:57.940
a corresponding nut

20:57.940 --> 21:00.940
at this price.

21:00.940 --> 21:03.940
This number shows

21:03.940 --> 21:06.940
the point where you will work at zero

21:06.940 --> 21:09.940
by buying a corresponding nut

21:09.940 --> 21:12.940
at this price.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.940
You saw how Solr works.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.940
It is a search engine.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.940
As I promised,

21:22.940 --> 21:25.940
we will talk about

21:25.940 --> 21:28.940
how to use the restrictions

21:28.940 --> 21:31.940
that we can impose

21:31.940 --> 21:34.940
when solving our tasks.

21:34.940 --> 21:37.940
The best restrictions are

21:37.940 --> 21:40.940
the non-strict restrictions

21:40.940 --> 21:43.940
on the top and bottom,

21:43.940 --> 21:46.940
that is, less or equal.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.940
The restrictions of the type equal

21:49.940 --> 21:52.940
to the number of nuts.

21:52.940 --> 21:55.940
Solver is not a strict tool.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.940
Try to give it a chance

21:58.940 --> 22:01.940
to oscillate

22:01.940 --> 22:04.940
within the range

22:04.940 --> 22:07.940
of 1.1 to 50 kg.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.940
This is a good solution.

22:10.940 --> 22:13.940
Solver is not a strict tool.

22:13.940 --> 22:16.940
Try to give it a chance

22:16.940 --> 22:19.940
to oscillate

22:19.940 --> 22:22.940
within the range

22:22.940 --> 22:25.940
of 1.1 to 50 kg.

22:25.940 --> 22:28.940
Solver will not experience

22:28.940 --> 22:31.940
significant jumps

22:31.940 --> 22:34.940
and will work much more stable.

22:34.940 --> 22:37.940
It will take much less time

22:37.940 --> 22:40.940
and its solution will be much more

22:40.940 --> 22:43.940
accurate and much more acceptable for you.

22:46.940 --> 22:49.940
What does the solution

22:49.940 --> 22:52.940
of the task in space look like?

22:52.940 --> 22:55.940
Imagine that you have only two nuts.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.940
In space, it looks like this.

22:58.940 --> 23:01.940
You have one axis, that is, one nut,

23:01.940 --> 23:04.940
the second axis, that is, another nut,

23:04.940 --> 23:07.940
and a certain plane

23:07.940 --> 23:10.940
that is your profit.

23:10.940 --> 23:13.940
It depends on how much you spend.

23:13.940 --> 23:16.940
One axis is one nut,

23:16.940 --> 23:19.940
the other is another nut.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.940
The plane in space is your profit.

23:22.940 --> 23:25.940
The limitations that we impose

23:25.940 --> 23:28.940
in space cut off certain parts

23:28.940 --> 23:31.940
of our solution plane.

23:31.940 --> 23:34.940
Our plane is a part of the solution

23:34.940 --> 23:37.940
that we are trying to solve.

23:37.940 --> 23:40.940
The solution is not a part of the solution.

23:40.940 --> 23:43.940
Accordingly, our plane

23:43.940 --> 23:46.940
from an infinite plane

23:46.940 --> 23:49.940
turns into a limited figure.

23:49.940 --> 23:52.940
If we start maximizing the function,

23:52.940 --> 23:55.940
it can take maximum value

23:55.940 --> 23:58.940
only at the point

23:58.940 --> 24:01.940
where several solutions converge,

24:01.940 --> 24:04.940
or at the edge, and so on.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.940
In space, it looks like a limited figure

24:07.940 --> 24:10.940
with several possible sides.

24:10.940 --> 24:13.940
It is difficult to imagine

24:13.940 --> 24:16.940
more than in three-dimensional space.

24:16.940 --> 24:19.940
Therefore, it is quite possible

24:19.940 --> 24:22.940
to imagine it in three-dimensional space.

24:22.940 --> 24:25.940
Try to do it.

24:25.940 --> 24:28.940
What else is necessary to talk about?

24:28.940 --> 24:31.940
Solver.

24:31.940 --> 24:34.940
Of course, everything works better

24:34.940 --> 24:37.940
with a solver, but it does not mean

24:37.940 --> 24:40.940
that it cannot be used for nonlinear solutions.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.940
However, as I said,

24:43.940 --> 24:46.940
it can find a local minimum

24:46.940 --> 24:49.940
or a local maximum,

24:49.940 --> 24:52.940
not finding a global minimum or maximum.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.940
The only way to deal with this

24:55.940 --> 24:58.940
is to move to solutions from different sides,

24:58.940 --> 25:01.940
that is, from different starting points.

25:01.940 --> 25:04.940
Unfortunately, in this case,

25:04.940 --> 25:07.940
there is only one possible option.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.940
As for the fairness of the solution,

25:10.940 --> 25:13.940
if we do not talk about the possibility

25:13.940 --> 25:16.940
of locking the solver in one of the existing minimums,

25:16.940 --> 25:19.940
then the solver solution is quite good.

25:19.940 --> 25:22.940
Nevertheless, if you have a lot of variables,

25:22.940 --> 25:25.940
try to get it out of balance.

25:25.940 --> 25:28.940
It is necessary to apply the solver

25:28.940 --> 25:31.940
many times already on the finished solution.

25:31.940 --> 25:34.940
Try to get it out of balance,

25:34.940 --> 25:37.940
changing the initial conditions a little bit

25:37.940 --> 25:40.940
or maybe even quite strongly.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.940
Okay, now we have talked

25:43.940 --> 25:46.940
about linear programming.

25:46.940 --> 25:49.940
According to the existing tradition,

25:49.940 --> 25:52.940
I will give you two simple tasks.

25:52.940 --> 25:55.940
The first of them is to find a solution

25:55.940 --> 25:58.940
and the second is to solve it.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.940
The first of them is similar to logistics.

26:01.940 --> 26:04.940
Both of them can be used

26:04.940 --> 26:07.940
to implement a general operating principle.

26:07.940 --> 26:10.940
Imagine a situation.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.940
Four people are standing

26:13.940 --> 26:16.940
in front of a narrow bridge across the river at night.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.940
One of them is fast enough

26:19.940 --> 26:22.940
and can cross the bridge in one minute,

26:22.940 --> 26:25.940
while the other is old enough

26:25.940 --> 26:28.940
and can't stand the weight of more than two people.

26:28.940 --> 26:31.940
Besides, there is no rail on the bridge,

26:31.940 --> 26:34.940
so it is impossible to walk on it at night.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.940
There is a flashlight, but it is only one.

26:37.940 --> 26:40.940
Someone has to give it to someone.

26:40.940 --> 26:43.940
Unfortunately, they cannot throw it away,

26:43.940 --> 26:46.940
because they risk to drop it.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.940
The task is to move all the people

26:49.940 --> 26:52.940
who have approached the bridge to the other side of the river.

26:52.940 --> 26:55.940
As a hint, as I said,

26:55.940 --> 26:58.940
when solving this task,

26:58.940 --> 27:01.940
you need to use a general operating principle.

27:01.940 --> 27:04.940
This was the first hint.

27:04.940 --> 27:07.940
If you don't want to wait for the second hint,

27:07.940 --> 27:10.940
stop the lecture now.

27:10.940 --> 27:13.940
The second hint will be a little later.

27:13.940 --> 27:16.940
The second hint.

27:16.940 --> 27:19.940
The solution is at the end of the lecture.

27:19.940 --> 27:22.940
Another task.

27:22.940 --> 27:25.940
It is called camel logistics.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.940
The task is this.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.940
There is a banana plantation on one edge of the desert,

27:31.940 --> 27:34.940
a thousand kilometers wide, and a store on the other.

27:34.940 --> 27:37.940
The crop of bananas this year was 3,000 pieces.

27:37.940 --> 27:40.940
We have one single vehicle, namely a camel.

27:40.940 --> 27:43.940
It is a modern camel with a self-loading and self-unloading device,

27:43.940 --> 27:46.940
a cruise stability system, GPS navigation, and so on.

27:46.940 --> 27:49.940
The camel's load is 1,000 bananas.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.940
But in order for the camel not to starve,

27:52.940 --> 27:55.940
it must eat one banana per kilometer.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.940
It doesn't matter if it carries 1,000 bananas,

27:58.940 --> 28:01.940
20 bananas, or nothing at all.

28:01.940 --> 28:04.940
It must eat anyway.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.940
The task is this.

28:07.940 --> 28:10.940
What is the maximum number of bananas

28:10.940 --> 28:13.940
that a camel can carry from a plantation to a store?

28:13.940 --> 28:16.940
Once again.

28:16.940 --> 28:19.940
The width of the desert is 1,000 kilometers.

28:19.940 --> 28:22.940
The load is 1,000 bananas.

28:22.940 --> 28:25.940
It eats one banana per kilometer.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.940
What is the maximum number of bananas

28:28.940 --> 28:31.940
that a camel can carry from a plantation to a store?

28:31.940 --> 28:34.940
And the hint that was mentioned in the previous task.

28:34.940 --> 28:37.940
When solving this task,

28:37.940 --> 28:40.940
we have to consider the following.

28:40.940 --> 28:43.940
We have discussed statistics,

28:43.940 --> 28:46.940
we have discussed linear programming.

28:46.940 --> 28:49.940
Linear programming assumes

28:49.940 --> 28:52.940
that you are in the deterministic world.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.940
When we were solving the task about nuts,

28:55.940 --> 28:58.940
we secretly assumed

28:58.940 --> 29:01.940
that all the nut mixtures

29:01.940 --> 29:04.940
that we produce will be bought from us.

29:04.940 --> 29:07.940
And at the prices that we set.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.940
But are we always so sure?

29:10.940 --> 29:13.940
Of course, not always.

29:13.940 --> 29:16.940
In fact, it is unlikely that a person

29:16.940 --> 29:19.940
can be so seriously sure.

29:19.940 --> 29:22.940
Unless we are talking about abstract mathematics.

29:22.940 --> 29:25.940
Imagine this situation.

29:25.940 --> 29:28.940
You are a boy who sells newspapers.

29:28.940 --> 29:31.940
You are a boy who sells newspapers.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.940
You buy newspapers from the editorial office for $1

29:34.940 --> 29:37.940
and sell them for $2.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.940
If you fail to sell all the newspapers,

29:40.940 --> 29:43.940
the editorial office is so kind to you

29:43.940 --> 29:46.940
that they take these newspapers for 50 cents each.

29:46.940 --> 29:49.940
You are a smart boy

29:49.940 --> 29:52.940
and you have managed to calculate

29:52.940 --> 29:55.940
that the average demand for your newspapers

29:55.940 --> 29:58.940
is 100 pieces of cloth per day.

29:58.940 --> 30:01.940
But this is the average demand.

30:01.940 --> 30:04.940
And the standard deviation is, let's say,

30:04.940 --> 30:07.940
20 newspapers.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.940
Under the conditions of this task,

30:10.940 --> 30:13.940
what should be the optimal order?

30:13.940 --> 30:16.940
As usual, we optimize the profit.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.940
It should be less than 100,

30:19.940 --> 30:22.940
exactly 100, more than 100.

30:22.940 --> 30:25.940
And if it is more than 100 or less than 100,

30:25.940 --> 30:28.940
then it should be more or less.

30:28.940 --> 30:31.940
And here a certain probability is involved,

30:31.940 --> 30:34.940
a certain uncertainty.

30:34.940 --> 30:37.940
Uncertainty is a broader concept than probability,

30:37.940 --> 30:40.940
as we have already noted.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.940
Nevertheless, we will consider

30:43.940 --> 30:46.940
that in this case we are dealing

30:46.940 --> 30:49.940
not with uncertainty as such,

30:49.940 --> 30:52.940
but with its part, probability.

30:53.940 --> 30:56.940
To solve such a problem,

30:56.940 --> 30:59.940
in general, this particular problem

30:59.940 --> 31:02.940
has a fairly accurate solution.

31:02.940 --> 31:05.940
But to solve such a problem,

31:05.940 --> 31:08.940
the so-called Monte Carlo method is used.

31:08.940 --> 31:11.940
A beautiful and loud name.

31:11.940 --> 31:14.940
Everyone immediately imagines

31:14.940 --> 31:17.940
James Bond sitting in Monte Carlo

31:17.940 --> 31:20.940
and winning roulette.

31:20.940 --> 31:23.940
Monte Carlo is a method

31:23.940 --> 31:26.940
of numerical solving of problems

31:26.940 --> 31:29.940
by a certain random number generator.

31:29.940 --> 31:32.940
In Excel, in Russian-language Excel,

31:32.940 --> 31:35.940
the function that generates random numbers

31:35.940 --> 31:38.940
is called sultchisl.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.940
In general, in all other programming languages

31:41.940 --> 31:44.940
it is called rand,

31:44.940 --> 31:47.940
from the word random, from English.

31:48.940 --> 31:51.940
This function gives the value

31:51.940 --> 31:54.940
evenly distributed between 0 and 1.

31:54.940 --> 31:57.940
Why exactly from 0 to 1?

31:57.940 --> 32:00.940
Because probability can take values

32:00.940 --> 32:03.940
from 0 to 1.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.940
Accordingly, the value of the function

32:06.940 --> 32:09.940
sultchisl is distributed from 0 to 1.

32:09.940 --> 32:12.940
But how do we use the function sultchisl

32:12.940 --> 32:15.940
for solving a problem

32:16.940 --> 32:19.940
to create a different distribution,

32:19.940 --> 32:22.940
different from 0 to 1?

32:26.940 --> 32:29.940
The so-called reverse distribution

32:29.940 --> 32:32.940
serves these purposes.

32:32.940 --> 32:35.940
In our case, since we believe

32:35.940 --> 32:38.940
that sales of newspapers are distributed

32:38.940 --> 32:41.940
normally, we will use a function

32:41.940 --> 32:44.940
that is used in Russian-language Excel.

32:44.940 --> 32:47.940
It is called normstobr.

32:47.940 --> 32:50.940
It is a normal standard reverse distribution.

32:50.940 --> 32:53.940
What will this function do?

32:53.940 --> 32:56.940
A normal cumulative distribution

32:56.940 --> 32:59.940
looks like this.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.940
It increases slowly and reaches 1.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.940
Thus, the function sultchisl,

33:05.940 --> 33:08.940
a random number,

33:08.940 --> 33:11.940
imagine an interval from 0 to 1,

33:11.940 --> 33:14.940
where this function is executed.

33:14.940 --> 33:17.940
The random number will give

33:17.940 --> 33:20.940
the value from 0 to 1.

33:20.940 --> 33:23.940
Accordingly, we will look for

33:23.940 --> 33:26.940
the corresponding point on this graph

33:26.940 --> 33:29.940
horizontally.

33:29.940 --> 33:32.940
Then we will mark the number

33:32.940 --> 33:35.940
of standard deviations

33:35.940 --> 33:38.940
at which this point is located.

33:38.940 --> 33:41.940
After generating a random number

33:41.940 --> 33:44.940
with a corresponding distribution,

33:44.940 --> 33:47.940
we will repeat this operation many times

33:47.940 --> 33:50.940
and get the result

33:50.940 --> 33:53.940
that we can already process.

33:53.940 --> 33:56.940
In the case of a boy,

33:56.940 --> 33:59.940
we will generate the sequence

33:59.940 --> 34:02.940
of demands for his product

34:02.940 --> 34:05.940
and compare what is the distribution

34:05.940 --> 34:08.940
of orders to the highest profit.

34:08.940 --> 34:11.940
It should be noted that

34:11.940 --> 34:14.940
this is not a Svender model,

34:14.940 --> 34:17.940
this is not the only task

34:17.940 --> 34:20.940
that can be solved in this way.

34:20.940 --> 34:23.940
Of course, the Monte Carlo method

34:23.940 --> 34:26.940
can solve anything.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.940
As an example, we will look

34:29.940 --> 34:32.940
at the modeling of gambling games.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.940
Gambling games are a very favorable

34:35.940 --> 34:38.940
basis for using the Monte Carlo method

34:38.940 --> 34:41.940
for one simple reason.

34:41.940 --> 34:44.940
The uncertainty used there

34:44.940 --> 34:47.940
is almost a pure probability.

34:47.940 --> 34:50.940
Yes, the Monte Carlo method

34:50.940 --> 34:53.940
lacks elegance and strictness.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.940
Of course, sophisticated mathematicians

34:56.940 --> 34:59.940
will never accept the results

34:59.940 --> 35:02.940
obtained by the Monte Carlo method.

35:02.940 --> 35:05.940
The solution to the Monte Carlo method

35:05.940 --> 35:08.940
may require a significant computational power.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.940
Here the so-called curse of dimensionality

35:11.940 --> 35:14.940
begins to work.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.940
Imagine that you are modeling

35:17.940 --> 35:20.940
the Monte Carlo method,

35:20.940 --> 35:23.940
for example, with the American option.

35:23.940 --> 35:26.940
This option can be realized at any time

35:26.940 --> 35:29.940
depending on the duration of its operation.

35:29.940 --> 35:32.940
For example, the duration of the operation

35:32.940 --> 35:35.940
is 90 days,

35:35.940 --> 35:38.940
and you want to simulate

35:38.940 --> 35:41.940
a thousand simulations every time.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.940
You do a thousand simulations

35:44.940 --> 35:47.940
on the first day,

35:47.940 --> 35:50.940
and from the end of each simulation

35:50.940 --> 35:53.940
you do a thousand simulations,

35:53.940 --> 35:56.940
and so on.

35:56.940 --> 35:59.940
By the 90th day,

35:59.940 --> 36:02.940
the computational power of all existing

36:02.940 --> 36:05.940
computers will be exhausted.

36:05.940 --> 36:08.940
Unfortunately, yes,

36:08.940 --> 36:11.940
sometimes this requires significant

36:11.940 --> 36:14.940
computational power,

36:14.940 --> 36:17.940
but fortunately not always.

36:17.940 --> 36:20.940
Therefore, the Monte Carlo method

36:20.940 --> 36:23.940
is desirable to have a reliable

36:23.940 --> 36:26.940
and reproducible random number generator.

36:26.940 --> 36:29.940
Why should the random number generator

36:29.940 --> 36:32.940
be reproducible?

36:32.940 --> 36:35.940
If you change something in your model,

36:35.940 --> 36:38.940
you must understand that the result

36:38.940 --> 36:41.940
that appeared is primarily related

36:41.940 --> 36:44.940
to changes in the model,

36:44.940 --> 36:47.940
and not to changes in the fact

36:47.940 --> 36:50.940
that the model is reproducible.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.940
This is a useful thing.

36:53.940 --> 36:56.940
Of course, it should be said

36:56.940 --> 36:59.940
that the random number generators

36:59.940 --> 37:02.940
used in the Monte Carlo method

37:02.940 --> 37:05.940
are based on simple numbers,

37:05.940 --> 37:08.940
on a pair of two simple numbers,

37:08.940 --> 37:11.940
and recently the calculation of random numbers

37:11.940 --> 37:14.940
has become a serious business.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.940
The task is simple,

37:17.940 --> 37:20.940
or more complicated,

37:20.940 --> 37:23.940
you come to the casino

37:23.940 --> 37:26.940
and play such a game.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.940
The probability of winning is 52%,

37:29.940 --> 37:32.940
you have a large amount of money,

37:32.940 --> 37:35.940
10 thousand dollars,

37:35.940 --> 37:38.940
and since you know that your game

37:38.940 --> 37:41.940
is winnable, you choose

37:41.940 --> 37:44.940
to play it.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.940
At the same time,

37:47.940 --> 37:50.940
since the game is quite strange,

37:50.940 --> 37:53.940
you play exactly a thousand times,

37:53.940 --> 37:56.940
and your goal is to take as much money

37:56.940 --> 37:59.940
as possible with you.

37:59.940 --> 38:02.940
Or, if you want,

38:02.940 --> 38:05.940
you can look at it differently.

38:05.940 --> 38:08.940
Two different players come to the casino,

38:08.940 --> 38:11.940
and one of them always bets 15%

38:11.940 --> 38:14.940
of what he has in stock.

38:14.940 --> 38:17.940
Let's see.

38:17.940 --> 38:20.940
Here is a graph of the amount

38:20.940 --> 38:23.940
at the disposal of a particular player.

38:23.940 --> 38:26.940
Okay, here they are both unlucky.

38:26.940 --> 38:29.940
Despite the fact that the game was winnable,

38:29.940 --> 38:32.940
both of them lost.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.940
But, let's say,

38:35.940 --> 38:38.940
the first player,

38:38.940 --> 38:41.940
who bets 15% of his fortune,

38:41.940 --> 38:44.940
lost a long time ago and hopelessly.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.940
The second player still has some money.

38:47.940 --> 38:50.940
Now I will press the F9 button,

38:50.940 --> 38:53.940
and so every time

38:53.940 --> 38:56.940
a new round of 1000 games will be re-read.

38:56.940 --> 38:59.940
Here the first player

38:59.940 --> 39:02.940
seems to be even lucky.

39:03.940 --> 39:06.940
The first player earned more than 90 thousand dollars,

39:06.940 --> 39:09.940
that is, 110 thousand minus

39:09.940 --> 39:12.940
the 10,000 he came with.

39:12.940 --> 39:15.940
But in the end,

39:15.940 --> 39:18.940
everything returned to its own in the circle,

39:18.940 --> 39:21.940
and the first player went bankrupt.

39:21.940 --> 39:24.940
While the second player fluctuated a little,

39:24.940 --> 39:27.940
and in the end remained

39:27.940 --> 39:30.940
with a more or less noticeable and acceptable amount.

39:30.940 --> 39:33.940
So, no matter how many times we press the F9 button,

39:33.940 --> 39:36.940
the player who bets the least amount

39:36.940 --> 39:39.940
will win almost always.

39:39.940 --> 39:42.940
Pay attention,

39:42.940 --> 39:45.940
he is in lilac color,

39:45.940 --> 39:48.940
here he even earned a decent amount.

39:48.940 --> 39:51.940
And so on.

39:51.940 --> 39:54.940
In exceptional cases,

39:54.940 --> 39:57.940
under conditions of very high luck,

39:57.940 --> 40:00.940
it is possible to win the first player,

40:00.940 --> 40:03.940
but it will be extremely rare.

40:03.940 --> 40:06.940
The situation will get even worse

40:06.940 --> 40:09.940
if we change the probability of winning

40:09.940 --> 40:12.940
from 52% to, say, 50.2%.

40:12.940 --> 40:15.940
Here, in fact, it is 50.2%.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.940
I'll just show you that it is really 50.2%.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.940
Then we need to bet

40:21.940 --> 40:24.940
not even 4%,

40:24.940 --> 40:27.940
but 0.4%

40:27.940 --> 40:30.940
so that our players

40:30.940 --> 40:33.940
will be able to win.

40:33.940 --> 40:36.940
And this is the most important thing.

40:36.940 --> 40:39.940
The most important thing is

40:39.940 --> 40:42.940
to win 0.4%

40:42.940 --> 40:45.940
so that our money grows

40:45.940 --> 40:48.940
as fast as possible.

40:48.940 --> 40:51.940
Let's see.

40:55.940 --> 40:58.940
The game is quite boring for the player,

40:58.940 --> 41:01.940
but nevertheless,

41:01.940 --> 41:04.940
if you pay attention,

41:04.940 --> 41:07.940
the first player's game is very fun,

41:08.940 --> 41:11.940
and of course,

41:11.940 --> 41:14.940
we have some unrealistic assumptions

41:14.940 --> 41:17.940
that the player's probability of winning

41:17.940 --> 41:20.940
is 50.2%.

41:20.940 --> 41:23.940
The player's probability of winning

41:23.940 --> 41:26.940
never reaches 50%.

41:26.940 --> 41:29.940
Of course, if the probability of winning is 49%,

41:29.940 --> 41:32.940
it is necessary to ask

41:32.940 --> 41:35.940
how much money

41:36.940 --> 41:39.940
to bet on the player.

41:39.940 --> 41:42.940
But sometimes,

41:42.940 --> 41:45.940
in some cases,

41:45.940 --> 41:48.940
one player will either stay at 0%

41:48.940 --> 41:51.940
or lose a little bit.

41:51.940 --> 41:54.940
But if you pay attention,

41:54.940 --> 41:57.940
a player who bets 15%

41:57.940 --> 42:00.940
will lose very quickly.

42:00.940 --> 42:03.940
This task is solved

42:03.940 --> 42:06.940
by Monte Carlo's method

42:06.940 --> 42:09.940
of simulation of existing values.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.940
Let's go back to the task

42:12.940 --> 42:15.940
of the newspaper seller.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.940
As I said,

42:18.940 --> 42:21.940
the price of a newspaper purchase is $1,

42:21.940 --> 42:24.940
the price of a newspaper sale is $2,

42:24.940 --> 42:27.940
and the price of a newspaper sale is $3.

42:27.940 --> 42:30.940
The price of a newspaper purchase is $1,

42:30.940 --> 42:33.940
the price of a newspaper sale is $2,

42:33.940 --> 42:36.940
and the price of a newspaper sale is $3.

42:36.940 --> 42:39.940
The cost of pre-order is $1,

42:39.940 --> 42:42.940
and the cost of over-order is $0.50.

42:42.940 --> 42:45.940
The publisher buys a newspaper

42:45.940 --> 42:48.940
purchased for $1 for $0.50.

42:48.940 --> 42:51.940
The average demand for a newspaper is $100,

42:51.940 --> 42:54.940
and the standard deviation is $20.

42:55.940 --> 42:58.940
What are we going to do here?

42:58.940 --> 43:01.940
We are going to simulate demand.

43:01.940 --> 43:04.940
The distribution will be approximately normal.

43:04.940 --> 43:07.940
The distribution will be slightly different

43:07.940 --> 43:10.940
from the normal one,

43:10.940 --> 43:13.940
but this is not very critical.

43:13.940 --> 43:16.940
We will simulate demand

43:16.940 --> 43:19.940
and we will see

43:19.940 --> 43:22.940
how the price of a newspaper

43:23.940 --> 43:26.940
affects the demand.

43:26.940 --> 43:29.940
We have different boys in this line.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.940
One boy orders 106 newspapers,

43:32.940 --> 43:35.940
the other 108,

43:35.940 --> 43:38.940
the third 110,

43:38.940 --> 43:41.940
the fourth 112,

43:41.940 --> 43:44.940
and so on.

43:44.940 --> 43:47.940
We will see how the demand

43:47.940 --> 43:50.940
affects the profit they get.

43:50.940 --> 43:53.940
We will run the simulation

43:53.940 --> 43:56.940
and leave the computer to count.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.940
As you can see,

44:05.940 --> 44:08.940
we have generated

44:08.940 --> 44:11.940
a little over 1,000 different demand values.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.940
We will build a graph

44:14.940 --> 44:17.940
of how the level of demand

44:17.940 --> 44:20.940
affects the profit.

44:20.940 --> 44:23.940
Here we have several different demand levels

44:23.940 --> 44:26.940
and the profit corresponding to them.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.940
We will insert a graph here.

44:29.940 --> 44:32.940
As usual, it will be a point graph.

44:32.940 --> 44:35.940
We will use our order as x

44:35.940 --> 44:38.940
and our profit as y.

44:42.940 --> 44:45.940
The graph shows that the optimal demand

44:46.940 --> 44:49.940
will be somewhere around $108-110.

44:49.940 --> 44:52.940
The optimal demand is affected

44:52.940 --> 44:55.940
by several conditions.

44:55.940 --> 44:58.940
In particular,

44:58.940 --> 45:01.940
the fact that we used

45:01.940 --> 45:04.940
a slightly shifted distribution.

45:04.940 --> 45:07.940
In addition, every time we generate

45:07.940 --> 45:10.940
a new batch of data,

45:10.940 --> 45:13.940
we will fluctuate a little

45:13.940 --> 45:16.940
and the optimal demand will be somewhere

45:16.940 --> 45:19.940
around $112-113.

45:19.940 --> 45:22.940
It would seem that the difference

45:22.940 --> 45:25.940
between the person who ordered 124

45:25.940 --> 45:28.940
and the one who ordered 108

45:28.940 --> 45:31.940
is not that big.

45:31.940 --> 45:34.940
But let's think about it.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.940
Is it a lot or a little?

45:37.940 --> 45:40.940
The graph does not show

45:40.940 --> 45:43.940
all possible expenses,

45:43.940 --> 45:46.940
in particular, rent, food etc.

45:46.940 --> 45:49.940
Imagine that the necessary expenses

45:49.940 --> 45:52.940
are $90,000.

45:52.940 --> 45:55.940
Thus, the person who ordered 124

45:55.940 --> 45:58.940
gets a profit of a little less than $1,000.

45:58.940 --> 46:01.940
While the person who ordered

46:01.940 --> 46:04.940
108 gets a profit of almost $4,000.

46:04.940 --> 46:07.940
This is almost 4 times higher

46:08.940 --> 46:11.940
than the level of 124 newspapers.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.940
It is clear that the 100 newspapers

46:19.940 --> 46:22.940
will be located at the level of 92,000.

46:22.940 --> 46:25.940
Nevertheless, the difference will be significant.

46:25.940 --> 46:28.940
If we are talking about profit,

46:28.940 --> 46:31.940
not sales,

46:31.940 --> 46:34.940
then the difference will be significant.

46:35.940 --> 46:38.940
Let's look at the histogram of our distribution.

46:38.940 --> 46:41.940
It looks like a normal distribution.

46:47.940 --> 46:50.940
Notice that the demand was several times

46:50.940 --> 46:53.940
around zero.

46:53.940 --> 46:56.940
Of course, we limited the demand

46:56.940 --> 46:59.940
from below zero.

46:59.940 --> 47:02.940
It is unlikely that someone will come

47:02.940 --> 47:05.940
and say that the demand is too high.

47:05.940 --> 47:08.940
Despite the fact that our average

47:08.940 --> 47:11.940
is only around 100 newspapers,

47:11.940 --> 47:14.940
the demand was several times

47:14.940 --> 47:17.940
significantly higher.

47:17.940 --> 47:20.940
Fortunately, the model of newspaper sellers

47:20.940 --> 47:23.940
has a strict solution.

47:23.940 --> 47:26.940
You can find it in the course application.

47:26.940 --> 47:29.940
The point is not in a strict solution.

47:30.940 --> 47:33.940
As a tradition,

47:33.940 --> 47:36.940
after the course is over,

47:36.940 --> 47:39.940
there are two tasks.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.940
Then, after a while,

47:42.940 --> 47:45.940
there are six tasks.

47:45.940 --> 47:48.940
The first task was given

47:48.940 --> 47:51.940
at the Moscow City Mathematical Olympiad

47:51.940 --> 47:54.940
for fifth-grade students.

47:54.940 --> 47:57.940
Two friends in the park met.

47:57.940 --> 48:00.940
The question was how old they were.

48:00.940 --> 48:03.940
The answer was strange.

48:03.940 --> 48:06.940
The number of pigeons was the same

48:06.940 --> 48:09.940
as the number of pigeons on the bench.

48:09.940 --> 48:12.940
The man said that he was not old enough.

48:12.940 --> 48:15.940
The second friend's son was older than him.

48:15.940 --> 48:18.940
Then it was clear.

48:18.940 --> 48:21.940
You need to guess

48:21.940 --> 48:24.940
how old the second friend's son was.

48:24.940 --> 48:27.940
There is a collection of coins.

48:27.940 --> 48:30.940
You can count them with your eyes closed.

48:30.940 --> 48:33.940
It is known that exactly 26 coins

48:33.940 --> 48:36.940
are on the top of the head.

48:36.940 --> 48:39.940
The coins should be divided into two piles

48:39.940 --> 48:42.940
so that there is an equal number of coins

48:42.940 --> 48:45.940
on each pile.

48:45.940 --> 48:48.940
You cannot distinguish the head from the eagle.

48:48.940 --> 48:51.940
You cannot distinguish the coin by touch.

48:51.940 --> 48:54.940
Here is a hint.

48:54.940 --> 48:57.940
All you can do with coins is to count and flip.

48:57.940 --> 49:00.940
The first task.

49:00.940 --> 49:03.940
A 32-kilogram cast-iron boat

49:03.940 --> 49:06.940
floats in the pool.

49:06.940 --> 49:09.940
The boat is thrown into the pool.

49:09.940 --> 49:12.940
How will the water level in the pool change?

49:12.940 --> 49:15.940
The water level in the pool will decrease.

49:15.940 --> 49:18.940
While the boat is in the pool,

49:18.940 --> 49:21.940
the water level in the pool will be 32 liters.

49:31.940 --> 49:34.940
When the boat is at the bottom,

49:34.940 --> 49:37.940
it takes only the volume of the water.

49:37.940 --> 49:40.940
It takes about 4 liters.

49:40.940 --> 49:43.940
The density of cast-iron is 8.

49:43.940 --> 49:46.940
The volume of the boat is about 4 liters.

49:46.940 --> 49:49.940
The water level in the pool is 28 liters.

49:49.940 --> 49:52.940
The water level will decrease.

49:52.940 --> 49:55.940
Next.

49:55.940 --> 49:58.940
There is a cup of water on the lever scales.

49:58.940 --> 50:01.940
You put your finger into the cup.

50:01.940 --> 50:04.940
Of course, without separating it.

50:04.940 --> 50:07.940
It seems that you hold the finger yourself.

50:07.940 --> 50:10.940
However, you probably do not take into account

50:10.940 --> 50:13.940
that the other people

50:13.940 --> 50:16.940
push their finger into the water.

50:16.940 --> 50:19.940
You overcome some resistance.

50:19.940 --> 50:22.940
What happens in this case?

50:22.940 --> 50:25.940
The cup is raised.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.940
The cup does not know

50:28.940 --> 50:31.940
that it has a finger in it.

50:31.940 --> 50:34.940
The water level has risen.

50:34.940 --> 50:37.940
The pressure has increased.

50:37.940 --> 50:40.940
The cup honestly transfers this pressure.

50:41.940 --> 50:44.940
The cup will weigh.

50:44.940 --> 50:47.940
The task with the bridge.

50:47.940 --> 50:50.940
The first thing that comes to mind

50:50.940 --> 50:53.940
is to send the fastest one.

50:53.940 --> 50:56.940
Let him run and wear this flashlight.

50:56.940 --> 50:59.940
This way you will get the result in 19 minutes.

50:59.940 --> 51:02.940
You can check.

51:02.940 --> 51:05.940
In fact, there is a general operational principle

51:05.940 --> 51:08.940
of the bridge.

51:09.940 --> 51:12.940
What is it?

51:12.940 --> 51:15.940
The principle is quite simple.

51:15.940 --> 51:18.940
If you have two long processes,

51:18.940 --> 51:21.940
you need to run them in parallel.

51:21.940 --> 51:24.940
Thus, those people who go 5 and 10 minutes

51:24.940 --> 51:27.940
should go together.

51:27.940 --> 51:30.940
How to do this?

51:30.940 --> 51:33.940
Of course, they cannot be let go first.

51:33.940 --> 51:36.940
Those who pass the bridge in 1 and 2 minutes should go first.

51:36.940 --> 51:39.940
Then 5 and 10 should go to the other side of the river.

51:39.940 --> 51:42.940
The second of the first two should return.

51:42.940 --> 51:45.940
And again they should go again.

51:45.940 --> 51:48.940
Thus, we get 2 minutes there,

51:48.940 --> 51:51.940
1 minute back,

51:51.940 --> 51:54.940
10 minutes there,

51:54.940 --> 51:57.940
2 minutes back,

51:57.940 --> 52:00.940
15 minutes,

52:00.940 --> 52:03.940
and 2 minutes forward, 17 minutes.

52:03.940 --> 52:06.940
This is almost 10% better than the decision

52:06.940 --> 52:09.940
that comes to mind automatically.

52:09.940 --> 52:12.940
It seems to me that 5 minutes of thinking

52:12.940 --> 52:15.940
is worth 10% improvement in performance.

52:15.940 --> 52:18.940
The task with the camel.

52:18.940 --> 52:21.940
There is another general operational principle.

52:21.940 --> 52:24.940
I'll tell you which one.

52:24.940 --> 52:27.940
The first one is how to solve it.

52:27.940 --> 52:30.940
It becomes clear almost immediately

52:30.940 --> 52:33.940
that if you load a thousand bananas on a camel

52:33.940 --> 52:36.940
and let it go to the maximum distance,

52:36.940 --> 52:39.940
then, of course, the camel will not reach any banana.

52:39.940 --> 52:42.940
Moreover, it will not be able to return even back.

52:42.940 --> 52:45.940
All this camel tuning,

52:45.940 --> 52:48.940
self-loading, self-unloading,

52:48.940 --> 52:51.940
the system of cargo sustainability, GPS and the desert

52:51.940 --> 52:54.940
serve the same purpose.

52:54.940 --> 52:57.940
The camel should be able to remove some part of the cargo from itself.

52:57.940 --> 53:00.940
And then return to the same place,

53:00.940 --> 53:03.940
knowing that the cargo will remain in safety.

53:03.940 --> 53:06.940
Thus, the first step to the solution would probably be like this.

53:06.940 --> 53:09.940
The camel takes a thousand bananas,

53:09.940 --> 53:12.940
goes 400 kilometers,

53:12.940 --> 53:15.940
throws 200 bananas,

53:15.940 --> 53:18.940
returns back, takes a thousand again,

53:18.940 --> 53:21.940
goes 400 kilometers, throws 200 bananas,

53:21.940 --> 53:24.940
returns back, takes a thousand,

53:24.940 --> 53:27.940
goes 400 kilometers.

53:27.940 --> 53:30.940
Here we find that in the place where it left the bananas,

53:30.940 --> 53:33.940
400 bananas are already lying.

53:33.940 --> 53:36.940
And it ate 400 bananas.

53:36.940 --> 53:39.940
It loads 400 bananas on itself,

53:39.940 --> 53:42.940
goes the remaining 600 kilometers,

53:42.940 --> 53:45.940
and thus it can deliver 400 bananas.

53:45.940 --> 53:48.940
Then the question arises,

53:48.940 --> 53:51.940
is this quantity the maximum?

53:51.940 --> 53:54.940
Maybe we can do something

53:54.940 --> 53:57.940
if, for example,

53:57.940 --> 54:00.940
we change the camel's first pass.

54:00.940 --> 54:03.940
Or maybe we can make more stops,

54:03.940 --> 54:06.940
and then the camel will be able to deliver more.

54:06.940 --> 54:09.940
It turns out that the general operational principle is this.

54:09.940 --> 54:12.940
If you have the equipment,

54:12.940 --> 54:15.940
it is desirable that it works with maximum load.

54:15.940 --> 54:18.940
That is, we need to break our thousand kilometers

54:18.940 --> 54:21.940
so that the camel starts with maximum load

54:21.940 --> 54:24.940
from each new point.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.940
If it starts with a thousand bananas

54:27.940 --> 54:30.940
three times from the first point,

54:30.940 --> 54:33.940
then it should start twice from the second point

54:33.940 --> 54:36.940
with a thousand bananas.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.940
And from the third point it should start once

54:39.940 --> 54:42.940
with a thousand bananas.

54:42.940 --> 54:45.940
If you write down the equation,

54:45.940 --> 54:48.940
that is, to get to the first stop,

54:48.940 --> 54:51.940
the camel should go back and forth,

54:51.940 --> 54:54.940
back and forth, five times.

54:54.940 --> 54:57.940
It should spend a thousand bananas for these five times.

54:57.940 --> 55:00.940
It is easy to determine

55:00.940 --> 55:03.940
that the distance it should cover is 200 kilometers.

55:03.940 --> 55:06.940
Now we have 2,000 bananas left at the second point.

55:06.940 --> 55:09.940
We need to go back and forth

55:09.940 --> 55:12.940
and spend a thousand bananas for this time.

55:12.940 --> 55:15.940
Of course, the distance should be 333.1 kilometers.

55:15.940 --> 55:18.940
Thus, from the third point,

55:18.940 --> 55:21.940
which is 200 plus 333.1,

55:21.940 --> 55:24.940
the camel starts again with a thousand bananas.

55:24.940 --> 55:27.940
It will eat as many bananas as it can,

55:27.940 --> 55:30.940
but it will be able to deliver the same 533.1.

55:30.940 --> 55:33.940
This is the optimal amount.

55:33.940 --> 55:36.940
You can check it in other ways.

55:36.940 --> 55:39.940
The task about two friends.

55:39.940 --> 55:42.940
It is an interesting task.

55:42.940 --> 55:45.940
As you have probably already seen,

55:45.940 --> 55:48.940
there is information where it is,

55:48.940 --> 55:51.940
and where it is not.

55:51.940 --> 55:54.940
The information starts with the phrase

55:54.940 --> 55:57.940
that two sons of a preschooler grow up.

55:57.940 --> 56:00.940
We assume that a preschooler is a child

56:00.940 --> 56:03.940
who is 7 or younger.

56:03.940 --> 56:06.940
What happens next?

56:06.940 --> 56:09.940
The person says that the number of pigeons

56:09.940 --> 56:12.940
is equal to the number of pigeons

56:12.940 --> 56:15.940
around that bench, and this is not enough.

56:15.940 --> 56:18.940
The solution is two-dimensional.

56:18.940 --> 56:21.940
Let's think further.

56:21.940 --> 56:24.940
What information is there

56:24.940 --> 56:27.940
that the elder looks like his mother?

56:27.940 --> 56:30.940
Of course, it's not that he looks like his mother.

56:30.940 --> 56:33.940
The information is that there is an elder.

56:34.940 --> 56:37.940
So, before that,

56:37.940 --> 56:40.940
when the first friend said

56:40.940 --> 56:43.940
that he did not have enough information,

56:43.940 --> 56:46.940
he was afraid that

56:46.940 --> 56:49.940
these sons could be twins.

56:49.940 --> 56:52.940
But since he was afraid that

56:52.940 --> 56:55.940
these sons could be twins,

56:55.940 --> 56:58.940
it greatly simplifies our decision.

56:58.940 --> 57:01.940
We will look for an answer in advance

57:01.940 --> 57:04.940
to the question of full squares.

57:04.940 --> 57:07.940
Thank God, there are not so many full squares.

57:07.940 --> 57:10.940
For some reason,

57:10.940 --> 57:13.940
you can immediately discard such numbers

57:13.940 --> 57:16.940
as 3, 5 and 7.

57:16.940 --> 57:19.940
Let's discuss.

57:19.940 --> 57:22.940
Let's say we take 49.

57:22.940 --> 57:25.940
What are the options?

57:25.940 --> 57:28.940
Either 1 and 49, or 7 and 70.

57:28.940 --> 57:31.940
Let's go on.

57:31.940 --> 57:34.940
36. What are the options?

57:34.940 --> 57:37.940
6 and 6,

57:37.940 --> 57:40.940
2 and 18,

57:40.940 --> 57:43.940
3 and 12,

57:43.940 --> 57:46.940
4 and 9.

57:46.940 --> 57:49.940
25 is the same,

57:49.940 --> 57:52.940
5 and 5, 1 and 25 do not work.

57:52.940 --> 57:55.940
16.

57:55.940 --> 57:58.940
What are the options?

57:58.940 --> 58:01.940
1 and 16, 2 and 8, 4 and 4.

58:01.940 --> 58:04.940
4 and 4, since there is an elder,

58:04.940 --> 58:07.940
2 and 8, 8 is an underage.

58:07.940 --> 58:10.940
The same thing happens with 3 and 3,

58:10.940 --> 58:13.940
or 1 and 9.

58:13.940 --> 58:16.940
9 is no underage.

58:16.940 --> 58:19.940
1 and 1, there is only one option left,

58:19.940 --> 58:22.940
that they are twins and they are one year old.

58:22.940 --> 58:25.940
2 and 2 are not working,

58:25.940 --> 58:28.940
so the second son is 1 and 4 years old.

58:28.940 --> 58:31.940
Another question about coins.

58:31.940 --> 58:34.940
It's a funny question.

58:34.940 --> 58:37.940
It's quite simple.

58:37.940 --> 58:40.940
Pay attention.

58:40.940 --> 58:43.940
The condition of the question says

58:43.940 --> 58:46.940
that the coins should be divided into two piles

58:46.940 --> 58:49.940
so that there are the same number of coins

58:49.940 --> 58:52.940
and the other pile should be the same.

58:52.940 --> 58:55.940
So, you can use the logic

58:55.940 --> 58:58.940
that a double negation is the same as a positive.

58:58.940 --> 59:01.940
Or, to put it simply,

59:01.940 --> 59:04.940
a minus to a minus gives a plus.

59:04.940 --> 59:07.940
You count 26 coins.

59:07.940 --> 59:10.940
Let's say, among them

59:10.940 --> 59:13.940
you got a K-coin with a top.

59:13.940 --> 59:16.940
Then how many coins are left in the second pile?

59:17.940 --> 59:20.940
26 minus K.

59:20.940 --> 59:23.940
Now, you flip the 26 coins

59:23.940 --> 59:26.940
with K-coins and a top.

59:26.940 --> 59:29.940
Now, in this pile

59:29.940 --> 59:32.940
there are 26 minus K coins.

59:32.940 --> 59:35.940
The K-coins with a top

59:35.940 --> 59:38.940
are now in the top.

59:38.940 --> 59:41.940
The coins with a minus K

59:41.940 --> 59:44.940
are now in the top.

59:44.940 --> 59:47.940
And the 26 minus K coins are left in the left pile.

59:47.940 --> 59:50.940
Thus, we got the same number of K-coins.

59:50.940 --> 59:53.940
There are many such interesting tasks.

59:53.940 --> 59:56.940
We need to solve them

59:56.940 --> 59:59.940
to make our brain work.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.940
It's very useful to solve them.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.940
Thank you.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.940
The course is over.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.940
I'd like to draw your attention

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.940
to statistics.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.940
Statistics is not a recurring thing.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.940
But statistics often allows us

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.940
to get more or less certain predictions.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:26.940
If not predictions,

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.940
then preliminary results.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.940
Let's call it so.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.940
Because it's not possible to predict

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.940
anything in general.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.940
Preliminary results will help you

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.940
to cope better with your business.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.940
Of course, such things as linear programming

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.940
and Monte Carlo method

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.940
are also very useful.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.940
But I'd like to draw your attention

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.940
to statistics.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.940
Of course, the question of statistics

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.940
is very complicated.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.940
But we have no other choice

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.940
than to believe

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.940
that the conditions

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.940
that existed in the past

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.940
will be repeated in the future.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.940
Study statistics and its application in business.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.940
Good luck to everyone!
