00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What is the position of the French marketing encyclopedia Mercatorgue?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Let's start with the definition.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
I would like to refer to the famous definition of the French marketing encyclopedia Mercatorgue.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Positioning can be defined as a strategically justified choice,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
with the aim of giving a particular attractive position to a product or a brand,

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
among other offers on the market in the consumer's consciousness.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
The term positioning was first proposed by Mr. Trout.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Yes, it is his merit.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
I would like to say that when I ask what word you associate positioning with,

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
I want to hear one thing, namely that positioning occurs in the consumer's consciousness.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
It is what remains of your activity in the consumer's consciousness.

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
There are two directions of positioning, which, for example, the encyclopedia Mercatorgue considers.

01:07.000 --> 01:17.000
The first is identification, which is what you plan to position, a product, a brand, a group of products.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
And the second is differentiation, a term widely used by Michael Porter.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
Differentiation is the definition of one or several features of a given offer,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
which distinguishes it from offers from the same area of reference.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
Today, the art of marketology is to find the right approach to the differentiation of one's business.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
The traditional approach looked like this.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
I often ask my students, please tell me what you are different from your competitors.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I am told quality, someone says price, someone says price-quality.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
I usually refer to such a standard formulation, we have the best price-quality ratio.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
And sometimes I ask these people, tell me, can your competitors say this?

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
And they answer, unfortunately, they often say so.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
It is the art of positioning that is the most important for Russian practice.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
And, to tell the truth, what is called today in Russia is a feature from this area.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
How to come up with features, how to make a consumer come to a store or call my office.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
This is the theme of positioning.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Look at this slide. Russian vodka. What is the difference?

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
Different kinds of vodka are sold in Russia, and note that their prices are very different.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Yermak is sold for about 59 rubles, and Kaufman Whitehall for 969 rubles.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
This is not only due to the volume of the bottle, but also to something else.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
As you know, the composition of vodka is absolutely the same, with slight differences in ingredients.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
Therefore, in order to learn how to sell vodka for 378 or 969 rubles, a certain art is required.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
And this art is related to positioning.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
Look at how the manufacturers explain the difference between expensive vodka and cheap vodka.

03:26.000 --> 03:37.000
In expensive vodka, the manufacturer claims that there are certain ingredients, that is, recipes that allow it to be distinguished.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
But the Forbes magazine notes that the cost of these ingredients is so low,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
at least it distinguishes itself in the best case for a ruble, if not for a penny.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
But the final price is just incredibly different.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.000
Before we get back to the topic of segmentation, I would like to dive into the story.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
The basis of segmentation was first developed by the famous Harvard professor Michael Porter.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
He has a whole theory of strategy as a market position.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
For the first time, Michael Porter drew attention to the fact that a company, if it wants to survive in a competitive market environment,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
must adhere to certain strategies.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Moreover, this is also applied to those companies that do not even imagine that such strategies exist.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
If I want to survive in the market, the first strategy is to sell at the lowest price.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Many companies in Russia adhere to this strategy.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
For example, the Euro network for a long time, or the American Walmart network.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
It seems to me that the whole of China as a country adheres to the strategy of leadership in costs.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
If we sell at a low price, there is always a buyer, whether it is the labor force or our product.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Because there is a huge segment of the economy class in the world.

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
But if for some reason you cannot sell at a low price, for example, your shareholder does not want to get a low profit,

05:07.000 --> 05:17.000
or the market is ready to pay a higher salary, then you start working in a quadrant called differentiation.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Moreover, if you are a market leader, then you must demonstrate leadership in differentiation.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
If you are a small company, then your strategy is called the focus of differentiation.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
What does differentiation mean?

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
This is an explanation to customers why it is you that they should choose, not their competitors.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
This is a very serious task.

05:38.000 --> 05:47.000
And, for example, such a strategic approach assumes that leadership in differentiation is based on four important elements.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Let's look at the next slide.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
You can sell your product more expensively than your competitor if you have a technical superiority of your product.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
For example, your car has more options.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Your laptop has more options.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Your video camera has more options.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
If this is not the case, then you can explain to your consumer that you have a higher quality.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
Yes, if the product is in high demand, it can always be sold at a higher price.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
Many consumers, when setting a price, are oriented towards the service.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
And it is such customers, sensitive to the service, who are ready to pay more for it.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Therefore, another explanation of differentiation is complex service.

06:35.000 --> 06:44.000
And finally, the fourth source of higher price, so-called differentiation, is the brand itself.

06:44.000 --> 06:54.000
Porter called it the creation of value signs, the impression that the value of the product is higher than that of the similar product of competitors.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
In fact, Porter expressed such a point of view.

06:58.000 --> 07:08.000
If you sell a product at a high price, there are four reasons to explain to the consumer the technical superiority, quality, complex service and the creation of a brand.

07:08.000 --> 07:18.000
But today the market is so saturated that for the first time we faced an unusual situation, which was noticed by another American, Jack Trout.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
What did he note?

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
He noted the following thing, that the quality and orientation of the buyer is not the most successful idea of differentiation.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
The 21st century shows an interesting thing.

07:30.000 --> 07:42.000
Porter, who wrote his work in the 80s, said that if you sell a high-quality product or provide a good service, then you are worthy of selling a product at a higher price.

07:42.000 --> 07:52.000
But Trout notes that the quality and orientation of the buyer is a common achievement.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
What does it mean?

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
If today you are talking about quality, then many of your competitors will say that we also have high-quality products.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
The world has changed so quickly by the 21st century that there is almost no place for low-quality products.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Everyone makes a high-quality product.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
The other thing is that some have less functional characteristics, others have more of this product or service.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
Therefore, to say that you have a high-quality product is not original, you do not stand out from the consciousness of the consumer.

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
The second thing is that many in Russia are still convinced that the reason for a higher price is the orientation of the buyer in the service.

08:30.000 --> 08:40.000
Some say that we have a good service, but Jack Trout notes that today the whole world understands that it is impossible to kick a client.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
You need to try to create a client-oriented company.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
Therefore, today there are more and more companies on the market that provide good service.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
Trout is the first to draw the conclusion that the quality and orientation of the buyer are not the most successful idea of differentiation.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Too many competitors play this role.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
The second element is that creativity should not be considered as an idea of differentiation.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
Creativity itself or creative marketing is a very good marketing to push a product in a very short period of time.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
This is a mistake of Russian marketers and companies that are looking for a new stock to increase their sales.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
But this way we do not differentiate our product, we are more likely to push customers to make another purchase.

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
Moreover, the Western world is very happy to observe Russian creativity, which is often limited to some criminality.

09:44.000 --> 09:53.000
I will not comment on this fact, but creativity itself, if it creates differentiation, is very often not easy.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
The third point is that the price is not the most successful idea of differentiation.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Trout has an interesting fact.

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
You can, of course, differentiate based on the price pyramid and find that niche in which your competitor is absent.

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
But often the price is not the source of choice for the customer.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
Even a high price does not mean that you will buy this product.

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
Although many people associate this with a fairly high quality and service.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
And finally, the last point is that the range of the assortment is not the easiest way of differentiation.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Many distributors are proud of their full stock and wide range.

10:40.000 --> 10:50.000
But you understand that the stock is an additional difficulty in capital turnover and, accordingly, in profitability.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
Thus, a new approach, which is declared by Mr. Jack Trout, is that if you want to differentiate,

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
you have the opportunity within the so-called 8 directions that he comments on.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Look at some of them, and I think this is a very justified recommendation.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
The first direction is called the ownership of the attribute.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
Each of us thinks about what attribute of his product or service is defining for the client.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Usually we do the following.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
I ask you to name several parameters of your service or product that are very significant for the client.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
This is what the client says when he negotiates with you about a deal.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Or he asks about it in the store, whether it is present.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Or, one way or another, he compares this attribute with the attributes of your competitors.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
The ownership of the attribute is the basis of the so-called positioning map,

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
which shows how the company differs from the competitor.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
I can show you several examples of this.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Look at this picture.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Even most of the successful companies or trading brands have succeeded

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
in creating one attribute,

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
in choosing one word that catches the consumer's attention and makes him or her aware of it.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Volvo has been associated with safety for many years.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
Most of my listeners today, when I say the word Volvo,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
speak primarily about safety.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
What happened?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
The company created an image,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
got into people's heads,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
and introduced one attribute, safety.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Mercedes is associated with engineering, BMW with managability,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Domino pizza with delivery to the house,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Pepsi Cola with youth,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
and Nordstrom with service.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
These are examples of attributes.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
My comment is as follows.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
Even if a successful company tries to find one attribute,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
it is difficult to find one attribute that Mr. Traut refers to.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Because two attributes are often a very laborious process,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
financially demanding.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Why?

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Because it is more and more difficult for the consumer to remember several differences of yours.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Ask yourself a simple question.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
What one word would the consumer say about your company or about you?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
This is your positioning.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
This is the attribute that got into your head,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
got into his head about you.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
This is a small exercise that Peter Drucker refers to.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
It is very useful for a beginner.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Because marketing starts with what the client thinks about you.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
If the client thinks that you are a reliable company,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
this is your positioning.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
If the client thinks that you are a non-commercial company,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
this is also your positioning.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And if the client, God forbid, thinks that you are a slave,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
this is also your positioning.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Let's move on to the next slide.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
This slide shows a positioning map in the delivery industry.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
You have noticed that this map exists.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
It seems to me that it is clear that every company should look for its own attribute.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
What is it better at?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Look at the axis.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
On the axis of abscissa, the horizontal axis,

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
the rational and emotional influence of the brand is noted.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And on the axis of the coordinates,

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
the large and small companies are noted.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
The medium and small companies.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
You see that DHL, a famous American company,

14:43.000 --> 14:51.000
claims itself as one of the major companies

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
that refers to rational motives.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
No one knows Russia better than us.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
At the same time, FIDEX,

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
a major American company that delivers goods and mail,

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
claims that it is more positioned in the area of emotional values.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Take a break.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
This is FIDEX.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
You will notice how many Russian companies position themselves today.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
You will see that they are not only small,

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
but in most cases they are in the quadrant of rational motives.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And only a few of them, for example,

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
try to find an excuse for their positioning in the impact on a person's emotions.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
You can choose what touches you the most,

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
what interests you the most as a buyer.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
In this slide, I wanted to show you the kitchen,

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
namely, the marketing technology for positioning,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
finding an attribute, differentiation.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
I brought this slide from Columbia University.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
It shows how a famous company Visa,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
with its Visa card,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
tried to enter the market and withdraw from its competitors,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Discovery and American Express.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
You have noticed that the kitchen is the same,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
it is a search for one attribute.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
The left column shows the criteria

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
by which Visa marketing company determined

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
what is the most important for the customers.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
The consumer survey showed that the following attributes

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
are associated with the customer's card.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Low annual payment,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
credit line,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
low percentage of acceptance and purchase warranty.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
Then the company concluded that there are two segments in the market

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
in relation to the credit card.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Pay attention, there is a segmentation.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
The first segment accounts for 45%

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
and this segment is mainly interested in low percentage and credit line.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
The second segment is more massive,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
55% of the total, for example, of all Americans.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
For this segment, acceptance is very important,

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
and then the purchase warranty and credit line.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Such studies can be conducted very easily.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
They can make a small survey of their consumers

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
in relation to the criteria that are important for the purchase

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
and which of the criteria is the most important.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Then, by means of office analysis,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
by the usual expert assessment,

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
the marketer tried to compare each of the parameters that are important for the customer.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Pay attention to the fact that Visa turned out to be good

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
in low annual payment and acceptance.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
What does this mean?

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
This means that there are two attributes that are very important for the company.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
But now, based on this study, it is very important to understand

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
how we position ourselves, what we differentiate,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
which of these attributes.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
And the company chose the fourth attribute, acceptance.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Its first slogans were, we are accepted everywhere.

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
This was very important, because the company was a leader in this attribute.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
And most importantly, this attribute was very important for the second segment.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
Why did the company not position itself as a company with low annual payment?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Pay attention, because there is no leadership in the attribute.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Discover also offers low annual payment,

18:38.000 --> 18:50.000
but the most important thing is that both the first and the second segments are not interested in this criterion.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
Thus, you see that companies are different,

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
marketers are looking for attributes, differentiation,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
but at least each of them finds what they are better at,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
and most importantly, what is important for the client.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
Looking at the Discover card, you can see that it should be positioned based on a low percentage,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
which is very important for the first segment,

19:17.000 --> 19:27.000
and for American Express, its positioning should be based on a good credit line.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
The first segment is also interested in this criterion.

19:33.000 --> 19:45.000
So, we looked at some of the kitchen of what we call segmentation and positioning of services or products.

19:45.000 --> 19:55.000
We return again to the picture, which is called 8 criteria for the differentiation of the trout.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
I will go from top to bottom, giving comments, and we will stop at each of them in order to understand.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
Mr. Trout has a famous assumption that if you want to differentiate,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
and you do not have attributes that are important for the client,

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
and that stand out among other offers on the market,

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
then the second way of differentiation can be leadership.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
This is an instrumental approach that shows the following fact,

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
which was highlighted, for example, in Europe and the United States.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Consumers prefer companies if they are leaders in the market.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Thus, a certain inner conviction is created,

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
that if I work with a company that is a leader, I am at least protected from arbitrariness or deception.

20:51.000 --> 20:59.000
This led to the fact that companies are leaders because they attract additional clients.

20:59.000 --> 21:07.000
The word leader is often associated with good quality, good service, reliability,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
or other properties that are important for the consumer.

21:10.000 --> 21:20.000
Therefore, differentiation based on leadership has become one of the important tools for the struggle for consumers on the competitive market.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
Today, in Russia, for example, the Head & Shoulders company claims that it is number one.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Shampoo number one from Perhati.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
This is just the tool of leadership.

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
For example, when Unilever puts number one on its deodorants,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
this is also a tool of leadership.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
For a long time, LG positioned its products in Russia and Moscow,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
claiming that it is number one.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Number one in the production of microwave ovens, refrigerators, and the like.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Leadership is a very important tool.

21:57.000 --> 22:08.000
But, to tell the truth, there have been a lot of deceptions in Russia related to differentiation based on leadership.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
Many companies have started to claim that they are leaders based on the results of some poll,

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
or the results of some magazine, or made very brief comments about what they are leaders in.

22:18.000 --> 22:26.000
Therefore, today, for example, in advertising, often when you see that the company refers to the fact that you are a leader,

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
you should probably be very careful about it.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
So, the second aspect of differentiation is called leadership.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
If you are a leader, it is enough to stand out from the rest.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Tell about it, but do not deceive your customers.

22:42.000 --> 22:54.000
Third, differentiation based on distinctive heritage is one of the most common approaches.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Remember what products you bought,

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
by showing off, I say in quotation marks, that this product is produced for a long time in history.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
What does it mean?

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
Many companies, in order to achieve the preferences and loyalty of their customers,

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
start using the tool called our history.

23:22.000 --> 23:30.000
For example, the beer industry in most cases claims that this beer is produced for many centuries.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
For example, Stella Artois claims so.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
Czech beer manufacturers do so, or German.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
This is exactly what is very important for the consumer.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Consumers want to join a certain history.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
For example, the Swiss watch industry is exclusively based on the basis of heritage.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
More than 400 Swiss watch manufacturers claim that their watches are produced for several centuries.

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
This gives them a chance to stand out from their competitors from Southeast Asia or America.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
The idea of heritage is a very important element.

24:05.000 --> 24:15.000
I would like to show you some examples of how tea companies are based on the idea of heritage.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
Look, you can see this inscription on the packaging of Twining tea.

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
In 1766, Thomas Twining became a tea merchant on the London Strand.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Since then, the company has been operating at the same address, which is a surprising and unique event.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
Now, as it was then, Twining tea gives the world an incomparable joy and satisfaction.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
What is it?

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
It is nothing more than a marketing trick to gain a foothold in the consumer's consciousness based on heritage.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Yes, the company has been operating in England since 1766.

24:52.000 --> 25:02.000
The most remarkable thing is that the company is trying to show its customers that the location of the company is a sign of value to it.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Let's look at another example.

25:07.000 --> 25:16.000
This is what Twining tea writes about in its packaging.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
Twining tea has been mixing our family tea for many years.

25:22.000 --> 25:33.000
Legend has it that my ancestor, Count Grey II, received this unique recipe as a gift from his father when he left China.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
A whole generation of my family enjoyed Earl Grey tea.

25:37.000 --> 25:45.000
Today, I continue the tradition of this famous tea, which is known all over the world, called Twining's Earl Grey.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
The signature is Count Grey VI.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
This is one of the tools of differentiation based on heritage.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
There is a very strong competition in the tea market.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
More than 10,000 tea companies exist in different countries.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
In order to adjust to each other, they have to use this approach very often.

26:07.000 --> 26:25.000
The next tool of differentiation is the idea of specialization.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
What does it mean?

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
Many companies are facing the need for specialization in order to survive in the competitive market.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
It is very difficult to be universal today.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
Moreover, it is almost impossible to cover all the processes.

26:43.000 --> 26:52.000
Customers are slowly starting to prefer specialized companies that know their business better.

26:53.000 --> 27:05.000
This created a need in some businesses, especially in those with a strong competition, to create specialized businesses.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
I would like to give a few examples from Russia.

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
If you pay attention, the FM radio market in Moscow is significantly different from the FM radio market in the region.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
If you come to Moscow, you will notice that there is a very specialized radio.

27:23.000 --> 27:31.000
For example, Radio Chanson, Rock, Classic, Jazz, Humor.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Why is this important?

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Because there are too many offers on the Moscow market.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
A specialized company must give its position to attract listeners.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Such specialization determines their choice.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
It is simply not profitable to be unspecialized.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
The company loses its customer and loses its face.

27:55.000 --> 28:05.000
Specialization becomes a very important element, for example, in small business services, doctors, lawyers.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
Specialization is very important in the market of magazines and newspapers.

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
Specialization is very important in the market of repair equipment.

28:17.000 --> 28:25.000
I think this method is more relevant for small Russian businesses.

28:25.000 --> 28:33.000
The fifth approach that Trout recommends is called preferential, as a good specialization idea.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
What does this mean?

28:35.000 --> 28:50.000
If you want to withdraw from your competitor, try to find someone who has already used your product, and if he has a loud name, exploit this name.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
For example, Omega watches are said to be worn by James Bond.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
This is exactly the case when we use preferences.

29:02.000 --> 29:11.000
For example, our watch is worn by Andrea Gassi, our watch is worn by Maria Sharapova or Anna Kurnikova.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
What is this?

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
Or we supply our product to Ford's conveyor.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
These are also tools of preference.

29:19.000 --> 29:27.000
Most consulting firms are not shy to mention companies they have worked with on their websites.

29:27.000 --> 29:38.000
Yes, this may be incorrect in relation to their former clients, but this is a necessary need to survive in competitive conditions.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
So, preferences.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
If you have a service list that Ford can give you, try to use this tool.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
The product as a specialization idea.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
What does this mean?

29:52.000 --> 30:02.000
If you are an exclusive owner of a product, you can declare in your advertising that you are an exclusive distributor.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I can bring any trademark.

30:05.000 --> 30:13.000
If you are an exclusive distributor in the region, why not tell your customers about it in advertising and not make up any more stories?

30:13.000 --> 30:21.000
The newest development as a specialization idea is widely used in the IT industry.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
This is a very fast-growing industry.

30:24.000 --> 30:35.000
Of course, the creation of a new matrix, Winchester or some other peripheral always leads to some advantage.

30:35.000 --> 30:47.000
My example with the Kokuya pen showed that this new development became one of the important differences for the company to sell it on the global markets.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
The last, the eighth step is called hot goods.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
What does this mean?

30:55.000 --> 31:10.000
You did not notice that many e-stores sell household appliances, phones, software, or any products of widespread consumption begin to exploit this idea.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
Hot goods is when the company lists the top ten best sales on its websites.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
Hot goods is a very important element that many companies use to highlight a product on their shelf.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
For example, the leader of sales, the best sales, and so on.

31:28.000 --> 31:38.000
All this is an instrument that leads to the fact that we manipulate our seller, making him pay attention to one product or another, or to our company as a whole,

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
and make our differences more profitable in his eyes, in his head.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
The last comment of Trout seemed very relevant to me.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
The desire for growth can ruin the idea of differentiation.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
Companies that grow fast face this problem.

31:53.000 --> 32:02.000
They are too fond of growth and the growing market, and lose their differentiation, which sooner or later, like a boomerang, will hit their income in the future.

32:02.000 --> 32:10.000
So do not forget when you start to grow, return to this table and say, why are you different from your competitors?

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
Because growth often alternates with decline.

32:15.000 --> 32:23.000
And after that you will have to return to this and say, why should our buyers buy our products?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Why should they do this?

32:25.000 --> 32:33.000
Thus, we have looked at several instruments of differentiation that create the basis for positioning of companies.

32:34.000 --> 32:46.000
The result of all this is, of course, the development of an effective slogan that accumulates differentiation in your idea.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
Look at a few examples that I show at my seminars to understand what the slogan is for.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Pizza Domino.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Within half an hour or at our expense.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
A slogan that highlights one of the attributes that are very important for a company.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
A company in the United States delivers its product within half an hour.

33:09.000 --> 33:15.000
This slogan comes from the program of differentiation.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
First, we have determined what is important for the client, then we have determined what we are better at.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
And then we convey this to our client through the so-called slogan.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
A short message that is attached to the consumer's consciousness.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
And look, Domino has become so effective that today it has come to Russia.

33:34.000 --> 33:44.000
And our Russian partners could not find anything better than to change the famous slogan of this company to our slogan.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
Our pizza is just class, call us now.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Do you feel the difference?

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
If there is a clear differentiation and positioning, then there is absolutely nothing in this slogan,

33:56.000 --> 34:06.000
except for the creative, to some extent, creative slogan in the form of a poem.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
Avis Rente Car is a famous, you can say, classic slogan.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
We are the second number, so it is more important for us to please you.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
This is a reflection of what has happened in this industry.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
Avis Rente Car has been competing with John Hears for a long time, a company that is a market leader.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
And it is everywhere that it claims that we are number one.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
And in order to get out of this situation, Avis Rente Car has proposed a very unusual slogan,

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
which is aimed at showing a good service.

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
Yes, we are the second number, we agree that we are not the first, so it is more important for us to please you.

34:40.000 --> 34:50.000
Patek Philippe watches, pay attention, position themselves in such an attribute as the sale of watches to the next generation.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
You pass your uniqueness to the next generation.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
And finally, for me, a very important thing is the company UNISYS.

34:58.000 --> 35:06.000
We often disassemble this case at seminars, how UNISYS is competing with its competitor on the market.

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000
And it was nice for me to read, to learn about their case, their slogan, which is called, we have learned to listen.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
A very important attribute, for example, in service.

35:19.000 --> 35:28.000
The next slide shows some examples of how slogans are built in competitive industries.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
For example, mobile communication is an example of this industry.

35:32.000 --> 35:42.000
Not only is it an oligopolistic market, it depends very closely on advertising and positioning.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
Find the difference and determine which slogan is more attractive for you.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
The future depends on you, it is convenient with us, or people say.

35:54.000 --> 36:03.000
Of course, there are pros and cons in each of them, but it is very important for me to know if there is some differentiation.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
And can you tell from these slogans how you differentiate about the company?

36:09.000 --> 36:19.000
I would like to show some examples of how modern marketologists are trying to use differentiation tools

36:19.000 --> 36:28.000
in a very mobile market of hotel services, hotel business.

36:28.000 --> 36:39.000
A famous company, Starwood, which has a network of hotels in its product portfolio,

36:39.000 --> 36:51.000
has faced a competition that cannot be called anything but, for example, a competition of large beds, king size.

36:51.000 --> 37:05.000
What does it mean? American hotels began to offer their clients either low prices or to tell that their beds are huge.

37:05.000 --> 37:13.000
In 2005, a new marketologist came to this company, who offers a very unusual positioning,

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
which creates a difference in the network of Starwood hotels.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
Take a look at Weston network. It is a network of expensive hotels.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
The marketologist offers the following.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
To create a key value of the update.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.000
The guests are offered herbal drinks, candles should be lit everywhere and quiet music should be played.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Smoking is prohibited in these hotels.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
In the morning, the gym with therapeutic baths is open.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
And the new slogan, that's what you should feel, confirms the following.

37:50.000 --> 38:00.000
The hotel offers a new look at life, an update of life for its clients.

38:00.000 --> 38:08.000
The most amazing thing is that the ad shows a leaf and lotus flowers, waterfalls and not a word about hotel business.

38:09.000 --> 38:20.000
The second slide shows how the network of Starwood hotels was repositioned.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
Here is the key value of the update.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
The network has signed a contract with Yahoo.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
Now the guests can use free Wi-Fi, download music and print documents.

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
And the slogan that represents this strategy is «Don't part with your business».

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
The third slide is the same company «4 Points».

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
The key value of the convenience is that the guests get free drinking water, coffee and the most amazing thing is a rounded price.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
And the slogan is «You deserve an honest relationship».

38:54.000 --> 39:05.000
It's not a secret that marketing marketers always try to manipulate our consciousness by creating unrounded numbers.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
And the example of unrounded numbers of 4 Points deserves trust.

39:11.000 --> 39:20.000
I would like to say a few words about marketing services and the differentiation and positioning of marketing services.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
Many Russian companies are not food manufacturers.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
Small and medium-sized businesses are business services.

39:28.000 --> 39:35.000
It concerns restaurants, shops and wholesale and retail activities.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
And we face an unusual element here.

39:38.000 --> 39:47.000
We face the need to position ourselves, on the other hand, with the difficulties of what is called «your own service».

39:47.000 --> 39:57.000
The difference between a service and a product is that a service simultaneously implies both the material and non-material part of a person.

39:57.000 --> 40:05.000
If any of you have studied marketing in detail before, for example, at the university or at separate seminars,

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
you probably know that a service is characterized by the property of «non-permanence of quality».

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
What does it mean?

40:12.000 --> 40:26.000
If people are involved in the business process, they are not ready to perform the same procedure with the «permanence of quality» as automated robots.

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
For example, we come to the same restaurant and get a different quality dish.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
We come to the same hairdresser and get a different haircut.

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
This «non-permanence of quality» leads to the fact that when we talk about the differentiation and positioning of services,

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
we face the need for the inseparability of the company's activities and marketing.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
This is a very important element.

40:52.000 --> 41:04.000
Marketing as a function of one or two people in the company, in industrial companies, is replaced by marketing of all services.

41:04.000 --> 41:15.000
If you open a restaurant, hotel, hairdresser or store, you know that your marketing and advertising are worthless

41:15.000 --> 41:22.000
if your employees who contact the client do not demonstrate a marketing approach to them.

41:22.000 --> 41:33.000
The second feature of marketing services that we constantly encounter is that the service is not protected by patents.

41:33.000 --> 41:48.000
Therefore, we observe a phenomenon in the service when competitors copy our slogans, innovations, approaches and positioning.

41:48.000 --> 42:00.000
This is why marketing services require alternating approaches, a constant desire to keep the consumer in tension, a constant creativity.

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
You cannot, having once invented a slogan, be sure that customers will come to you for years.

42:06.000 --> 42:14.000
You will have to push them to come to you all the time with a new approach based on one of the eight models of differentiation.

42:14.000 --> 42:23.000
The third problem of differentiation and positioning of services is that in marketing services,

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
control over the interaction of the client's employee is very difficult.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
This is what creates the basis for earning money for small business.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
It is not an anonymous product, but a relationship with the employee and the client.

42:38.000 --> 42:54.000
Since it is difficult to reproduce the quality of the employee's service, we face the fact that any bad mood can affect the client's service.

42:54.000 --> 43:04.000
Therefore, there is a whole wheel of service that shows that if you want to have a good service, you must have motivated employees.

43:04.000 --> 43:15.000
Therefore, the problem of controlling the interaction of the employee and the client is faced with how comfortable the employee feels today.

43:15.000 --> 43:22.000
Is he not ready to pour his indignation at the boss or internal conflicts in the company on his consumers?

43:22.000 --> 43:33.000
This is a very difficult problem because not a single supervisor and not a single company manager can be present all the time in the negotiation with the employee and the client.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
The problem with the growth of the company is even more important for marketing services.

43:37.000 --> 43:44.000
I said that in marketing services the most important thing is the person providing the service.

43:44.000 --> 43:54.000
When a company grows, the previous differentiation, the previous ideology, culture of the company that creates the basis of differentiation begins to blur.

43:54.000 --> 44:04.000
Therefore, fast-growing companies lose the most in differentiation and need it most in the new repositioning.

44:04.000 --> 44:13.000
The problem of labor productivity is due to the fact that we cannot make a person do many times more than he does today.

44:13.000 --> 44:22.000
Yes, we can buy more efficient machines, but we cannot make the waiter serve not 10, but 100 people.

44:22.000 --> 44:41.000
The problem of innovation. It is not a secret that in marketing services, innovations are welcomed, but they can be offered much less than innovations in technology or production.

44:41.000 --> 44:51.000
And finally, in any country there are restrictive standards related to work and personnel, and, accordingly, this suggests that this limits our differentiation.

44:51.000 --> 44:58.000
We cannot provide a 24-hour service if employees have to go to work in 8 hours.

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
In addition, you understand that different employees provide different services.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
The machine can work 24 hours, the employee cannot.

45:07.000 --> 45:14.000
In this regard, I would like to tell a funny story. Bad news for business services.

45:14.000 --> 45:22.000
If you are in business, the problem of positioning is very important for you.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
You will have to compete with Nordstrom, Disneyland and McDonald's. What does this mean?

45:28.000 --> 45:46.000
When we are engaged in service, we often have to do not only better than our direct competitors, but often do better than those service companies that our client encounters.

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
At my seminars, I often tell funny stories that happened in Seattle.

45:52.000 --> 46:02.000
One of the banks that serves VIP clients encountered an unusual situation.

46:02.000 --> 46:09.000
The annual survey of clients showed that they were not satisfied with the services of the bank.

46:09.000 --> 46:15.000
The manager, who faithfully believed in the quality of the service of his company, was simply surprised by this.

46:15.000 --> 46:22.000
He kept asking the marketer why they were satisfied last year, and why these clients were not satisfied this year.

46:22.000 --> 46:36.000
This year we have improved our service much more. We bought furniture, trained our employees, installed coffee machines, and hung beautiful paintings.

46:37.000 --> 46:55.000
When a marketing agency surveyed the dissatisfied clients, they found out that the clients were dissatisfied with the service of the bank only because Nordstrom opened in Seattle.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
Nordstrom is a chain of shops that sells shoes and clothes.

47:01.000 --> 47:10.000
The manager could not understand what Nordstrom had to do with it when the marketing agency brought this information to them.

47:11.000 --> 47:32.000
If I come to a bank, I compare your service with the places where I was, the hotels where I was, the shops where I go to buy clothes, or the restaurants where I have dinner.

47:32.000 --> 47:46.000
If we are engaged in business services, we often have to do our service no worse than the service of the companies that our clients visit.

47:46.000 --> 47:53.000
You probably know this slide, I just wanted to comment on it.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
There are three stages of product or service development.

47:57.000 --> 48:04.000
1. Acceptable product. What does this mean? Our product must have minimum acceptable standards.

48:04.000 --> 48:12.000
This was observed in Russia, for example, in the late 80s and 90s. What did this mean?

48:12.000 --> 48:25.000
You only had to bring this product, and the hunger that the economy and consumers experienced was enough to grab this product, regardless of what quality you offer or what service you demonstrate.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
2. Acceptable product. This is the stage of product development.

48:29.000 --> 48:37.000
For example, in America, the times have changed from the early 1900s to the 1930s.

48:37.000 --> 48:43.000
Ford was able to produce one car model, and this was enough for customers to buy it.

48:43.000 --> 48:49.000
It was important for consumers to have a product of their own, and to be able to buy a cheap black car.

48:49.000 --> 49:00.000
But the competition grew and the market became what is called an acceptable product.

49:00.000 --> 49:06.000
The West has experienced this for decades, and Russia has quickly come to this.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
What is an acceptable product? It is a response to the needs of the consumer.

49:09.000 --> 49:18.000
Today, many companies face the problem of wanting to understand what the consumer wants, and to build a service or product to meet their needs.

49:18.000 --> 49:26.000
This is where the mass marketing research comes from, and the demand for marketing activities.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
The point is to understand what else the customer needs to buy.

49:32.000 --> 49:40.000
But the most surprising thing is that Russia and the rest of the world are entering the third stage of product development, which is called an acceptable product.

49:40.000 --> 49:47.000
What does this mean? It doesn't matter how you cut, it doesn't matter how you serve the customer.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It is important to surprise them.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
You can't do better in your restaurant than in a competitor's restaurant.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
Very often you don't have enough money for this, so try to do it differently.

50:00.000 --> 50:09.000
Service is the area where real wars for differentiation begin.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
The conclusion is not to think about how to do something better, but to think about how to do it differently.

50:14.000 --> 50:20.000
This is the area that created the school called the Blue Kenan strategy.

50:20.000 --> 50:25.000
Do it differently, and only then will you find a new niche and be able to make money.

50:25.000 --> 50:33.000
Don't repeat the competitor. You didn't have time, you were late. You need to do something differently.

50:33.000 --> 50:50.000
Commenting on the fact that in service you have to compete with other organizations, not with competitors, I would like to show you the famous matrix of the 5-force competitor's porter and the added idea of Groove.

50:50.000 --> 51:06.000
If you want to survive in this market, the famous CEO of Intel said, if you want to survive, you have to learn to make your products differently.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
This is the most correct way of differentiation.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Don't do it like others, it won't help you survive.

51:12.000 --> 51:21.000
Do it differently. Do it differently. Service in a restaurant, in a hotel, do your seminars differently.

51:21.000 --> 51:27.000
Thus, we finish this topic and move on to the next slide.

51:27.000 --> 51:33.000
8 ways to improve your business.

51:33.000 --> 51:39.000
I think this slide is very instructive to say what can be done to get rid of competitors.

51:39.000 --> 51:49.000
If you are a small and medium-sized business, you will have an idea of how to adjust to the consumer's consciousness.

51:49.000 --> 51:55.000
The first step is to bring elements of your hobby into your business.

51:55.000 --> 52:01.000
This is especially true for restaurants or services.

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
If you collect coins, try to show them to your clients.

52:07.000 --> 52:16.000
If you collect silver utensils, spoons, teapots, samovars, decorate the interior of your restaurant.

52:16.000 --> 52:23.000
It is your hobby that makes your business irreplaceable, unique.

52:23.000 --> 52:31.000
This is often true for services, whether it is hotels, hairdressers, restaurants, or a training center.

52:31.000 --> 52:41.000
Remember, your hobby will tell you how to make your business unforgettable, and most importantly, unique.

52:41.000 --> 52:49.000
The second thing that gives you an opportunity to position yourself well is the nonsense of your employees.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
I wrote this in quotes, understanding how often we listen to our employees.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
They often come up with very unusual ideas.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
These ideas are the basis of what we call differentiation.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
We teach our employees to see differently.

53:06.000 --> 53:13.000
For example, Starbucks has heard from its employees that they can sell music discs in coffee shops.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
This is also a difference that is very difficult to reproduce.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Bring in the element of scandal.

53:19.000 --> 53:26.000
The experience of the Euro network in Russia shows that we can often adapt to the competition with scandal.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
Scandal can be of different nature, both decent and indecent.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
The experience of the Euro network has shown that Russia values this scandal, even some kind of sloppiness.

53:35.000 --> 53:44.000
Of course, I do not call for such body art, which the Euro network demonstrated in its PR promotions.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
Nevertheless, some element of scandal always attracts customers, making them talk about you.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Change one of the elements of business sharply.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
This is a very important tool for adapting to competitors.

53:57.000 --> 54:06.000
If we talk seriously about this, the model of changing four elements of business appeared for the first time in the framework of the Blue Ocean School.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
Think about what needs to be done to adapt to competitors.

54:11.000 --> 54:20.000
Change the price, change the workplace, change the office, the location of the business, or something else.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
For example, cashier and cashier.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Can you imagine a store without a cashier?

54:26.000 --> 54:32.000
Yes, Walmart. Today, in the United States, Walmart offers such a system.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
You made a purchase and you do not need a cashier. You can pay automatically.

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
The same applies, for example, to what would happen to your business if you removed your office.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
For example, you opened a hairdresser's and removed your office.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
There is no room at all.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Will business change? Yes.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
But you will not disappear. You will leave others.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
Because thousands of people repeat the same thing.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
They remove the square, place chairs there and start cutting.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
Think about what would happen if you did not remove the square.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Dig in the old.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
I think this is the most interesting.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Today is the most interesting move.

55:13.000 --> 55:22.000
In Russia, people are more and more interested in their history and in the use of some elements of antiquity in their business.

55:22.000 --> 55:28.000
Old literatures, imitation of antiquity, legends, what Tvanins does.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
All this creates a certain aura, what we call differentiation.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
It gets into people's brains.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Make your cherished dream come true.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
This is another piece of advice.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
Of course, some of us have hobbies, but some of us have dreams.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Someone dreamed of being an artist.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Someone dreamed of becoming a poet.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
You can bring this dream into your business.

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
You know, the symbiosis of two elements creates what we call unusuality.

55:54.000 --> 56:01.000
At the junction of new hobbies, new approaches, what is very difficult to reproduce is born.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Listen to the complaints of your clients.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
I think this is one of the most important elements in building your business correctly.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
Often, complaints from clients are not just complaints, they are priceless tips.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Sometimes, people should be paid for complaints.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Because they gave you advice for free.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
What to do to improve your business.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
How often we take it with some rejection.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
Thinking that we are offended or want to point out something bad.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
But in reality, we hear something more.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
We see ways to develop business.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
For me, it is very important when people say, we would like to hear this.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
We are not interested in this.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
I see how people are interested in this.

56:46.000 --> 56:52.000
And then I start thinking quickly about how to change this in my training programs.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
And the last step is very important.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
When you look in a neighboring restaurant and hairdresser, you better not do it.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
It is no longer interesting.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
No one needs such a benchmark.

57:03.000 --> 57:09.000
A real benchmark starts when you look in neighboring areas.

57:09.000 --> 57:17.000
Usually, new products, unusual differentiation appears when we are completely different.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
We borrow something from another sphere.

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
I always ask the question, what can you borrow for a training business?

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Where to copy from?

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Yes, you can go to the trainings of other coaches.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
But we will not do anything better from this.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
We can repeat what a successful coach has done.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
But maybe you need to go to a neighboring industry and see how they do it.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
What is related to training? What kind of business?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
For example, it can be a show business.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
Therefore, go to a concert or a theater.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
See how these companies do it.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
And bring this element.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
The task is to adjust to other competitors.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
Learn to be interested not only in what you do,

57:58.000 --> 58:04.000
but look for ideas around your business in adjacent industries that resemble your business.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Thus, we have gone through 8 ways to improve your business.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
Each of which can disquiet you from the competitor.

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
Catch you in your mind as an unusual company that needs to be addressed once again.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Let's move on to the next slide.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
I wanted to show you funny ways to focus some Western companies.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I hope they will be interesting for you.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Look.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
IKEA today claims that it is not a furniture manufacturer,

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
but a company that strives to make everyday life better.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
Disney claims that it does not produce movies and even amusement parks,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
but makes people happy.

58:46.000 --> 58:52.000
But the funniest are two famous TV manufacturers, Sony and Ben Contolofsen.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
These companies claim that...

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
Actually, they are not a manufacturer of household electronics.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
Sony, it turns out, perfects miniature art.

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
And Ben Contolofsen, a famous Danish company that produces unusually expensive TVs,

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
claims that it perfects the art of poetry.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
When I stand in front of Ben Contolofsen TV once again,

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
I always remember whether it is poetry.

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
That is why these TVs cost 10,000 dollars, not 2,000 like Sony.

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
And finally, look at the funny way Absolut positions itself.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
It claims that our consumer should feel like a sensible,

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
intelligent and creative person because he drinks Absolut.

59:42.000 --> 59:48.000
So, I wanted to show you that there are some approaches

59:48.000 --> 59:54.000
that treat what customers come to us for in a completely different way.
