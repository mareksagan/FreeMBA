00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
Good afternoon. I am Oleg Levitsky, a professor at the Russian Economic Academy.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
At the Academy, I teach MBA courses, human resources management, management of organizations, and sociology.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
I am also an active HR consultant and advise many foreign and domestic companies.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
The topic of our meeting today is the analysis of the variety of approaches that exist in foreign and Russian companies,

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
which change their sphere of activity, which change their functioning.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
That is, the whole complex of the sphere of problems is associated with changes in the company,

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
with changes in the team in the company, with changes in the interaction of the management system.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
Of course, the first question that arises in this regard is what we will understand under the organizational changes.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
It should be said that despite the fact that the problem of change is a traditional problem of management

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
and has been analyzed and studied for about a century and a half,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
nevertheless, there is a common opinion and a common approach to what change is,

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
what are its qualitative characteristics, what quantitative aspects are associated with it, still does not exist.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
We, of course, will not go into theoretical debate about what organizational changes are,

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
but will pay attention to those significant characteristics that, if necessary, have practical significance

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
and indicate that the company has somehow changed, changed its sphere of activity,

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
changed its method of work, changed its methodology of providing services,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
methodology of positioning on the market, changed its brand.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
When we talk about organizational development, about organizational changes,

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
then usually we understand a certain normative strategy of retraining.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
There is a company, there are employees of this company, there is a certain product that this company produces

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
and provides for the market, which is its competitive advantage,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
which is the niche that the company occupies on the market.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Naturally, since the events that take place on the market,

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
since the demands of consumers, the needs of consumers, the psychology of consumers are constantly changing,

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
then in this regard, if the company wants to constantly be in the framework of economic development,

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
it must react to these changes, it must join the feedback that exists,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
and, accordingly, it must change if necessary.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
If the company, no matter how successful it is, stops changing,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
then there is a period of stagnation, a period of stagnation,

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
which will inevitably end with the company losing its position and generally ceasing to exist.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
The corresponding examples are all what we will look at next.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
So, when we talk about organizational development,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
we mean, first of all, the presence of a retraining strategy.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Organizational development is not a 7-minute process.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
That is, someone wanted to change something, and we make changes.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
If we are talking about organization and organizational development,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
then, first of all, there is a certain planned strategy,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
when there is a goal that needs to be achieved,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
when there are ways to achieve this goal,

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
when there is a business plan, a business planning that concerns the processes that will be associated with the changes,

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
when certain funds are invested,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
when significant effort is invested to make these changes happen,

03:58.000 --> 04:06.000
and, accordingly, we must always know at the very beginning what we want to get in the end.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
Only in this case can we say that organizational development will be purposeful, not accidental.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
If we know what the changes are for and for what purpose,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
both inside and within the operating company.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
As for the retraining strategy, the development strategy,

04:27.000 --> 04:36.000
it is primarily aimed at changing beliefs, assessments and attitudes to work.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
For these are the main subjective factors that are largely central

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
in terms of obtaining the desired result,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
in terms of positioning the company in the market,

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
in terms of obtaining the desired business results, the desired commercial success.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
In addition to the retraining strategy, aimed at changing beliefs, assessments and attitudes to work,

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
the central issue of organizational development is the problem of adaptation.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Adaptation to the changes that occur on the part of the market,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
that occur on the part of the consumer-oriented companies.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
If a company wants to meet the requirements,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
if it wants to make a profit,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
it must react very clearly and very subtly

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
and adapt to the changes that occur in the environment.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
And it is the reaction to these changes that is, in fact, the main,

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
the main driving factor, the very motivation that is aimed at organizational development

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
for obtaining the final result, for obtaining the final goal.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
It should be said that organizational development is a process that has its own structure,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
which has its own systematization.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
In this sense, all organizational development includes a certain organizational reconstruction.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
There is one regular schedule, there is one regular structural division.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
And if organizational development occurs, it can change as a company structure,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
it can change as a system of duties, as a system of relationships,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
as a system of any approaches that exist in the company.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
And this is the reconstruction of the already existing system.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
The existing system can be very successful.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
But, nevertheless, this system cannot be unchanged,

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
at least simply because the external situation changes,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
the internal situation, the situation in the company changes,

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
new people appear, new employees appear, new owners appear, new shareholders appear.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
And, of course, all these changes, which are a complex process,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
must be taken into account.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
In addition, when we talk about the re-training strategy

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
necessary for organizational development,

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
a very important value in this case is the problem of support

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
and reinforcement of the changes that are taking place,

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
because all organizational development is a change in the relationship of people,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
it is a change in the interaction of people, it is a change in the functioning of people.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
There is no organizational development at all, there is no abstract organizational development.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Organizational development is always an action, it is always a feeling,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
a relationship, a result, a function of those specific people,

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
of those specific employees who are present in the company

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
and who carry out, implement all the functioning that is carried out in the company.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
We will understand organizational development in this broad context,

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
because the topic of our today's lesson is actually familiar,

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
what kind of changes can occur,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
what kind of results of these changes can be present.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
And, accordingly, we want to familiarize ourselves with those various forms

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
of organizational changes, organizational constructs that occur.

08:23.000 --> 08:32.000
We can make many arguments in favor of the necessity of organizational changes,

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
but I think it is enough to refer to those people who are undisputed authorities

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
in modern concept management, in modern commerce, in modern business.

08:45.000 --> 08:53.000
For example, Porter noted that competitors will immediately and necessarily introduce any company

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
that will stop improving and introducing innovations.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
And there is only one way to maintain the achieved competitive advantages.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
They must be constantly improved and move in the direction of more complex forms.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
Porter means the obvious fact that not only small companies, not only newly emerging companies,

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
but also monsters, brands that exist on the market, must also constantly change,

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
because no matter what sector of the market you capture, no matter what part of the market you have,

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
in any case, the successes and results achieved once will not be constant.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
There are competitors who claim the same market share.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
There are new companies that introduce new products.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
There is a struggle for the consumer, a struggle for demand,

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
there are all kinds of concepts related to the offer of any goods and services.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
And there is a constant movement, constant change,

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
which in no case allows for any constant and unchanging forms.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And if we want to conform to the realities that exist on the market,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
we must constantly respond to these requests.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
There must be a constant feedback between the requests that occur

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
and the proposals that we as a company issue,

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
regardless of the existing merits, regardless of the past merits,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
regardless of the plans that we build for the future,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
regardless of the funds that are being invested.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
However, the process of organizational changes is a rather complex process,

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
when it is quite difficult to predict the final result.

10:40.000 --> 10:49.000
Let's look at three facts that are the generalization of events on the market,

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
which show that the organizational development of the companies is changing,

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
and that the output efficiency is very low,

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
in the sense that many things are changing, but not all of them are achieving the desired result.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
As the studies conducted in the last decades of the last century have shown,

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
only a quarter of the projects on changing business processes were successful.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
75% of the projects, three quarters,

11:24.000 --> 11:31.000
which included funds, which involved time and effort,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
did not lead not only to desired results,

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
but to significant deterioration in the companies where they were invested,

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
and three quarters of the companies were not able to achieve and even return the results that they had.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Change is always a risk.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
It is a risk that either you achieve the result,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
get economic profit,

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
or you will not lose what you had,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
the invested funds will not be recovered,

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
and you will have to look for other ways and other opportunities for economic growth and economic development,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
which are still necessary to be carried out.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
Another figure indicates that usually companies,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
as they grow,

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
which are present and occupy a certain segment of the market,

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
tend to merge to increase their share of influence,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
to increase their presence,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
to increase their segment of the market,

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
or more successful, larger companies,

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
which control larger areas of the market,

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
want to swallow smaller companies in order to get their resources,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
their achievements, their results,

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
and in the end get the desired result.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
It turns out that despite the fact that a large number of mergers and acquisitions are carried out annually,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
only 25%, again, the same quarter,

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
will be successful in terms of the fact that only the costs of these mergers and acquisitions are paid.

13:23.000 --> 13:32.000
Mergers and acquisitions are a process that requires significant time, financial, tax, customs efforts,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
and all these processes are costly.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Only 25% of these costs are actually paid.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Again, the same three quarters of mergers and acquisitions,

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
at best, do not lead to the desired results,

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
but to the growth of certain economic indicators for which these mergers and acquisitions were carried out.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Again, I would like to emphasize that we are talking about a civilized business,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
which is mainly held in the West,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
or the civilized conditions of business in Russia,

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
and in this case we are talking about economic indicators of mergers and acquisitions,

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
without any other specific factors of this impact.

14:16.000 --> 14:25.000
The next example I would like to give is related to the widespread introduction of information technologies

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
and information systems at large enterprises.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
Today, a great importance, as you all know, is the use of computer technology,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
computer processing, computer control,

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
and the automation of business processes that are carried out at enterprises.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
Moreover, since these processes are quite costly,

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
only large organizations, large companies, large companies

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
are able to allocate free funds to carry out any other information interventions.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
So, despite the fact that the number of funds that are constantly invested

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
in the process of introducing information technologies,

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
in the process of automated production management,

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
only 9%, even less than a quarter, of these funds are being spent.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Less than a tenth of the funds, less than a tenth of the projects,

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
of the entire huge number of projects for the introduction of information systems and technologies, are being spent.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
That is, at least justify the funds that are invested in them.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
And in this regard, another problem arises.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
The funds are already very often being invested,

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
however, the managers see that the investment of these funds does not give the desired return,

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
there is disappointment, and 31%, that is, a third of all these projects,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
are simply not fully satisfied.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
The funds were invested, the expectations were high,

16:04.000 --> 16:12.000
the organizational structures, organizational management systems were planned,

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
and the problem of introducing information systems is not a problem of a day, a week, a month,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
it is a problem that can last a quarter, six months, a year.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
And now, after a long period of time, the management is convinced

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
that the desired result is not what has not been achieved,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
but there are deteriorations in the work,

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
there are changes in those or other problems that exist in the company,

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
and the management refuses to continue the introduction of information technologies

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
and strives to return to what was before.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
This is not always possible, as we have already said,

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
because changes have the quality that if they have started,

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
they already destroy the existing structure,

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
they change those or other processes that occur in the organization,

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
and, in the end, we all work with living people,

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
and it is impossible to make a click, for example, on a project, on a photo shoot,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
and return everything to the initial conditions,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
in order to start from the beginning as if nothing had happened.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
If we look at the actual results, at the economic indicators,

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
it turns out that a large number of organizational changes,

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
a large number of organizational development results are not fully achieved,

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
and, at best, a quarter of these projects lead to some result.

17:47.000 --> 17:57.000
But this quarter leads to significant changes, significant shifts in the market,

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
and in this regard, those companies that brought the corresponding changes to the end,

18:03.000 --> 18:11.000
those companies that made up the future plan of further development,

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
the plan of these changes, which introduced both strategic and tactical changes,

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
they achieve significant results and become leaders,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
become leaders again for a certain time.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
This is the leadership that requires constant support,

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
this is the leadership that requires constant investment of funds,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
constant control of the availability of feedback,

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
and this is the leadership that is supported only by reacting to those changes,

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
those requests, those needs that are presented to the company both from the market

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
and based on those internal reasons for the development, existence and functioning of the company.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
The next question that we would like to consider is what is good.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
Changes are necessary, changes are being made, changes require certain costs,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
changes do not always lead to the desired result,

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
but still, what are the successful models of changes,

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
or what models describe the process of organizational change and development,

19:26.000 --> 19:39.000
and what models can serve as the basis on which we can build the process of change in each particular company.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
It should be said right away that there are a lot of these models.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
These models depend on what the company produces, on the services that it provides.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
These models depend on different aspects of business,

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
these models are different in different industries, in different elements of business,

20:05.000 --> 20:14.000
but the main goal, the main task of these models is to highlight the main elements

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
that should be paid attention to in order to build a certain strategy,

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
in order to create a strategic plan of development.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
Organizational change models are closely related to the growth models, to the organizational change models.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
We will consider, for example, the model proposed by Leon Danko,

20:41.000 --> 20:49.000
and this model shows the connection between the process of business growth and time

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
that has passed since the moment of the company's emergence and development.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
This model highlights five main periods,

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
and in each of these periods there are certain difficulties,

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
certain crisis points that need to be overcome,

21:09.000 --> 21:20.000
because these are the critical moments, critical elements that arise in the development of each organization.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
As for the original element of the model,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
when the company is just emerging,

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
when the company begins to fight for the conquest of certain markets,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
then this is a period of so-called hard work.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
We really put in effort, we establish contacts, we establish connections,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
we are persistently fighting for consumers,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
because the company does not usually emerge in the open,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
it emerges already with the presence of other companies,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
and accordingly it needs to find its niche,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
find its niche in that market, in that business that exists.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
This is really hard work, it requires a regular working day,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
it requires new unexpected solutions,

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
it requires a very fast response to the requests that occur,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
it requires a very fast feedback.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
As for the results of this hard work, they are unpredictable again.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
Most companies can't withstand such a load,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
they may not have enough funds,

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
they may have internal conflicts and contradictions,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
they may have problems with their founders,

22:35.000 --> 22:44.000
and accordingly they are less successful and do not stand out,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
not only as a leader, but they stand out,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
at least in the middle of the market,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
they leave the market, they re-profile,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
disintegrate, absorb, merge,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
do something else,

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
but in fact these are the companies that could not withstand the competition

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
and were forced to re-profile their activities or stop their existence.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
This is the majority of companies.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
According to the research,

23:15.000 --> 23:24.000
on average, about 85-90% of newly formed companies are unsuccessful.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
But again, if this company arises,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
of course, this company is small at first,

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
and accordingly, it is like a small business,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
it has such a search activity,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
where can I get involved,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
where can I enter the already divided,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
already formed economic market.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
And only 10% or a little more of newly formed companies

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
find their place under the sun,

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
and conquer part of the market,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
their economic segment,

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
and begin to develop further.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
This is the next stage of the fall,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
this is the stage of creating myths,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
creating myths about how we started,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
how it all was, what we achieved,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
thanks to what we did it.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
This is the period of the creation of corporate culture of the company,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
corporate history of the company.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
This is the period of creating corporate norms,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
corporate regulations, corporate ethics.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And as for this period,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
this is really a period of mythologization,

24:33.000 --> 24:41.000
when we try to forget about those failures that inevitably occurred,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
when we try to forget about those losses that occurred,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
and like any ordinary living person,

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
we try to remember only positive things,

24:53.000 --> 25:04.000
that were certain steps that led us from zero to the success that we have now achieved.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
In principle, all the big companies that exist today

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
are companies that have been thrown around by various kinds of myths.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
The same brands that are present on the market,

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
it is always a kind of a combination of myths related to one or another brand.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
We may no longer remember how PepsiCo started,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
how Coca-Cola started,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
we may no longer remember how Adidas started,

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
how Ford cars started,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
how Mercedes cars started,

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
but there is already a certain mythology for each company,

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
for each product, for each brand,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
which carries the most distinctive,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
the most successful,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
the most significant features of the brand,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
product, service, results.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
This is due to the fact that one name of a brand

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
actually forms our relationship, our demand,

26:09.000 --> 26:17.000
and our readiness to invest in the acquisition of a product of this particular company.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Although, as it often happens,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
a competitor company can offer the worst product,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
but this company is not yet known,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
this company was created recently,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
this company has not yet gained popularity on the market,

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
this company does not yet have a number of service centers.

26:37.000 --> 26:44.000
And, accordingly, it is better for me to pay for an already known mythologized brand

26:44.000 --> 26:53.000
than to risk and buy a product that may turn out to be successful,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
or maybe not.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
The creation of myths is a rather significant and important stage in the life of any company,

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
because this is where the dilemma arises.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
A company can start to rest on laurels.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
I already have a stable position on the market,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I already have a stable demand,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
I already have a huge number of consumers,

27:19.000 --> 27:26.000
and, accordingly, I can slightly weaken my activity,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
because I already have certain achievements.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
This is the so-called state of comfort.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
The company experiences, the company owners, the company employees,

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
those who strive to come to work in this company

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
precisely in order to touch these myths,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
to become part of these myths,

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
they are in a state of comfort,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
and this is a very dangerous state.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
As the analysis of business history shows,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
as the analysis of different companies shows,

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
usually this state of comfort ends after 2-4 years,

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
when you have to pay attention to the fact that sales are falling,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
the number of advertisements is increasing,

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
competitors that have emerged are dumping prices,

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
and, accordingly, they are taking away the markets that we have already conquered.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
This comfort is what leads to stagnation,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
what leads to stagnation,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
and, accordingly, from this state of comfort,

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
you need to leave for further development,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
for further organizational changes.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
This will make it harder,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
because the company has a history,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
the company has experience,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
the company has traditions that have proven its success,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
but, on the other hand,

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
these conditions, these successes, these traditions

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
must be changed,

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
because they have changed as external conditions,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
as external demand, as external consumers,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
as well as internal conditions,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
the conditions of working in a company,

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
as well as those or other material compensations and stimulations

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
that have ceased to reflect the realities of the market,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
and a certain or other flow of frames arises.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
The state of comfort is a very dangerous state,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
because this state is deceitful,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
it leads to calm,

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
and this calm leads to the fact that we are skipping,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
we are losing the feeling of the market,

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
we are losing the feeling of the changes that are happening,

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
and this leads either to the liquidation of the company,

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
to the bankruptcy of the company,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
to the re-profiling of the company,

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
or the next stage of hard work begins.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
The Danko model is good because it shows

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
that the life of the company is always cyclical,

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
and after I have achieved indisputable success,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
after I have overcome my myths,

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
I still have to go back to the very initial stage of hard work

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
in order to adapt to the changes that have occurred in the market,

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
in order to abandon the usual ways of working,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
to change the production line,

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
to change the offered services,

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
and, accordingly, to analyze the feedback again,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
to go back to the normal working day,

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
to look at the changes again,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
the returns that we get,

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
in order to either develop further

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
and create new myths,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
achieve new successes,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
achieve new results,

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
or, as they say, the loser leaves again.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
In fact, in this case,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
no matter what level of development the company is at,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
it should always follow the principle

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
of learning, doing new things,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
and sharing its experience,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
sharing its successes,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
sharing its opportunities,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
or you will be destroyed,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
and, accordingly,

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
you will lose all the achievements very quickly.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It's a simple model,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
but, nevertheless,

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
this model reflects a very important principle

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
in the growth of any organization.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Those achievements that we get,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
indisputable achievements,

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
can often be a Trojan horse

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
in which the prospects of subsequent loss,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
prospects of subsequent bankruptcy,

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
prospects of subsequent failures are laid.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
Taking into account these events,

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
those models of change

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
that are based on the corresponding models of organization growth

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
and reflect these elements,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
we will talk about this a little later,

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
when we move on to the models of organizational development

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
and organizational changes.

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
Naturally, this is one of the models,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
the model of the DUNK.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
As I said,

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
there are quite a lot of models of organization growth,

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
but today we will focus on the model of the Grainer.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
The Grainer model is more structured,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
more operational,

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
it highlights both the stages of organization development

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
and crises.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
Those crises that are invariably associated

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
with situations of organizational growth

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
are those crises that need to be overcome,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
because either we will overcome these crises

33:26.000 --> 33:33.000
and each crisis will be a means for subsequent development,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
or this crisis will lead to the fact

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
that the organization will cease to exist,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
the organization will lose its already won positions

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
with all the consequences resulting from it.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
As for the Grainer model,

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
it is also based on two axes.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
First of all, the growth of the organization,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
the achievements that the organization receives

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
as a result of its development,

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
and the time that is required for this growth.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
The Grainer highlights five main phases of growth,

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
and as for these phases of growth,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
each of them corresponds to its own crisis.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
The first phase is the creative growth phase.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
The organization enters the market,

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
it takes its place under the sun,

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
it searches for goods and services

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
that are in demand by consumers,

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
but which are not yet presented in the right quantity and form.

34:39.000 --> 34:45.000
This is the stage of the hard work on the Danka model,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
which we have already discussed.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
If this stage is successfully overcome,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
that is, we find what to produce,

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
what will be in demand,

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
if we understand what services will be in demand,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
then the organization begins to develop,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
the organization begins to make a profit,

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
and this is where the first crisis of leadership comes.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Usually, an organization is created by people,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
and if the organization is small,

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
then in this situation all people work together,

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
all people make the same big contribution to the development of the organization.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
The organization has achieved some results and is expanding.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
New employees appear, new structures appear,

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
and now there is not necessarily a constant fight,

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
but an unanimous struggle between the founders,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
between the founders,

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
between the owners of the company,

35:56.000 --> 36:03.000
who contributed the most to the organization's development,

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
how should the profits and dividends be distributed between them,

36:09.000 --> 36:15.000
and who will determine the path of the company's development.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
Who will then make, control,

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
launch the plan of organizational development, organizational change,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
because all people are different,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
and there is not always agreement between them

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
in the ways and results that they want to achieve.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Since, as we have already said,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
all organizational development, all organizational changes

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
require a significant contribution of free resources,

36:43.000 --> 36:48.000
then the question of leadership is not in vain,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
because depending on the leader's views,

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
depending on how much trust he uses,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
how much authority he uses,

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
you can reasonably assume the degree of success

37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
of the changes that will be made.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
If this crisis of leadership is not overcome,

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
then it leads to the division of the company,

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
it leads to the loss of the won positions,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
and, accordingly, in fact,

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
other smaller companies may arise,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
separated from the original company,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
which will begin their independent movement,

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
which will begin their independent efforts

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
in the same economic struggle.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
If the crisis of leadership is overcome constructively,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
when the owners, the managers,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
when those people who were originally in the company

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
agree among themselves how to develop,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
agree with you about the sphere of responsibility,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
share their powers, delegate their powers,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
delegate the sphere of responsibility that they have,

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
then the next stage of organizational growth,

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
the stage of directed growth, comes.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
We agreed on a strategy,

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
we agreed on who is responsible for which element of this strategy,

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
we developed a plan,

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
we reached an agreement inside,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
and we begin to develop the company further.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
We see the end goals,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
we know how to move towards these goals,

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
and we begin to invest funds for further movement.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
Again, there are both positive and negative moments.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
The positive moment is that

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
there is a constant control of feedback,

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
which is being developed in order to achieve

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
more economic results,

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
strengthen, improve its place in the market,

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
and expand the segment it occupies.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
The negative side is that

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
any change is always risky.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
It will be due to the fact that

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
we do not know whether we will get the desired result.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
The statistics we talked about at the beginning,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
that no more than a quarter of changes

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
can lead to a buy-in and development.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Therefore, the situation of directed growth

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
has its own crises.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
The second crisis is coming.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
The first was the crisis of leadership.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
The second crisis is the crisis of autonomy.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
The third crisis is the crisis of the company's success.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
The problem is that

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
we are now the legislators of the market,

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
we are now being compared to the market,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
we are now being guided by the market,

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
and in this connection we are able to lead

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
and make new proposals.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
We are becoming a leader in the market,

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
and we are becoming a leader in the market.

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
We are losing the need to constantly look at our competitors.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
We now have a certain resource

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
to make certain innovations,

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
to make certain proposals,

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
to offer new products and services.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Again, as for the crisis of autonomy,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
we can really achieve new results

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
that will enable us to make new decisions.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
We can achieve new results

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
that will help the company to grow.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
But autonomy is good

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
because it is an innovation,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
and any innovation will never give a guaranteed result.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
And this autonomous swimming,

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
this autonomous swimming without looking back,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
without looking around,

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
can lead to the loss of the company's reputation,

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
to the loss of economic potential,

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
to the loss of invested funds,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
to the need to return to the existing results,

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
to the need to pay close attention

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
to the requests,

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
to the demands,

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
to the claims that arise

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
both from the external point of view

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
and from the internal point of view.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
If this crisis is not overcome,

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
then the company can cease to exist,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
it can be absorbed,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
it can merge with someone,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
it can be divided,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
it can be fragmented

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
with all the external factors

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
that are involved in the process.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
And this is a very good thing.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
If this crisis is overcome,

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
and this autonomy has led to constructive,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
positive results,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
has led to the fact that we react

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
to the feedback that occurs,

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
then the company begins to grow and develop further,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
and the opportunity to return to the existing results

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
comes.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
And this is a very good thing.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
And the next stage is coming.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
The development of the company,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
the growth of the company through delegating.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
In this case, delegating concerns

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
delegating responsibility, delegating initiative.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
The company is stable,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
and the company can afford

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
to invest funds in some risky proposals.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
As for risky proposals,

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
I can delegate the opportunity

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
to carry out

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
either risky events,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
or to produce

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
either risky products.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
And I can't be sure

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
that the invested funds

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
that are spent will be repaid.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
But this is a very good thing.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
But this delegating is necessary,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
because the company must develop.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
And in fact, in this situation,

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
the delegation of the authority of development occurs.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
In the end, the company's manager

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
cannot constantly make strategic plans

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
about development.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
You need to make some tests,

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
check where it turns out.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
By making tests, we can make mistakes.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
But the company is mature enough.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
The company is stable enough

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
to allow itself to invest

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
in these innovations

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
and to receive both mistakes

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
and achievements.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
Here comes the next crisis.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
The crisis of control.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
I give you relative freedom

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
in terms of your competence.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
I give you freedom in terms of what to produce,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
how to produce,

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
how to promote new products.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Because the company is developed

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
and there are some funds

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
that I can invest in development.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
However, this delegation

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
cannot always try something.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
If we will introduce brilliant ideas

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
that may be repaid,

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
it can very often lead to

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
a small amount of money being repaid.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
And accordingly, we will take a large amount

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
of money that could be spent

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
on development, reorganization,

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
strengthening, changing,

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
or even PR actions.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
And accordingly,

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
these will be the difficulties

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
that arise in terms of

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
economic growth.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Combining control and delegation

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
is a rather difficult situation.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
Because I delegated responsibility to you,

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
I delegated the possibility of risk to you,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
but at the same time I control

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
this risk to be within reasonable limits.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Who can tell where these limits are reasonable

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
and where they are not?

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Everything is based on management,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
everything is based on the experience of the manager,

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
everything is based on the knowledge

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
and competence of those people

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
who perform the controlling functions.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
And control is necessary, of course.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
But control can choke the initiatives

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
that are being implemented,

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
and control naturally contradicts

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
the delegated actions.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
There are two possible ways.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
Either it is an over-the-top,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
a control that will actually

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
prevent the possible innovation

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
that will prevent the possible delegation

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
of the responsibility that is being taken

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
in terms of the introduction of new products.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
On the other hand,

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
control can be constructive

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
and aimed at cutting off

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
really too risky options.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
A too risky option can be

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
in a small number of cases

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
lead to very good economic results,

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
but usually,

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
miracles in business are not always possible,

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
usually it can lead to a loss of funds,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
a loss of time, a loss of position

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
with all the consequences that come from it.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
If control becomes all-encompassing,

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
then the organization becomes stagnant,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
which can be accompanied by

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
the sense of comfort that we talked about earlier,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
because we get stable results.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
And that's good.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
If control becomes constructive

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
and this crisis is overcome

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
at the optimal ratio of changes,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
innovations,

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
and the ability to make

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
a decision

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
that will lead to good economic results,

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
the organization continues to grow.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Look, at every stage,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
there is an opportunity

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
for either collapse or development.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
There is always a balance,

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
and it is very difficult to find the golden mean.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
To find it,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
you need to have a sense of the market,

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
you need to have intuition,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
you need to know and be able

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
to take risky actions,

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
but still so risky

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
that there is always an opportunity

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
to cover the gaps that arise.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
If the crisis of control is constructively overcome,

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
the next stage of the organization's development comes,

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
which Greiner calls

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
the stage of growth through coordination.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
As for coordination,

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
in this case,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
the organization is large,

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
there are already a large number of units in the organization.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Naturally, each of these units

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
believes that it is the most important

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
for the company's functioning.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
And if this particular unit

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
develops,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
the results will improve.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
I don't think that in this case

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
I'm saying something unexpected.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Every person who is successful

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
in their field of activity

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
believes that this particular field of activity

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
is the most important.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
I can not deny it,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
but I can not deny that

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
the organization's internal structure

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
and the coordination of departments

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
are very important.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
There are many different units in the organization.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Each of these units

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
contributes significantly to the company's development.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
If these units have proven their effectiveness,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
if these units exist,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
they perform a certain function

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
to get a certain structure,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
a certain system of the company's functioning

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
to get results.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Naturally, each of these units

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
strives to take the responsibility

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
to get the funds for the purchase.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
You need to go to the accounting department

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
or the finance department

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
to get the funds.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
But the representatives of other structures

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
come to the accounting department

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
and prove the same thing about their departments.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
And then there is a struggle

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
for the funds for development,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
for amortization, for innovation,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
for training.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
And the coordination of requests

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
and interactions

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
and functions of the organizations

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
that exist is very important.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Unfortunately,

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
in this situation

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
there is a need for a judge

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
or an arbiter,

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
usually the head of the organization,

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
who decides which department,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
which department will get the funds

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
at this time,

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
in this financial year,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
in this quarter,

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
to get the results.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
This often leads to resentment.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
The head of the department

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
thinks that their assets are not valued,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
that the representatives of another department

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
do not deserve to be more successful

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
and get more results.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
And all this leads to conflicts,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
to dissatisfaction, to internal tension,

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
to deterioration of the social-psychological climate

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
in the collective.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
At this fourth stage of coordination growth,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
the next fourth crisis arises,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
the crisis of prohibitions.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
If the head of the department

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
decides who will get the funds

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
and who will not,

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
that is, if he imposes a veto on the proposals

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
that are submitted by the representatives

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
of other departments,

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
then the decision can be subjective,

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
the circumstances can be predicted,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
it can be momentary.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
And in this regard,

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
it can have a negative impact

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
on the results of the company,

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
on the implemented product,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
on the services provided,

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
on the working conditions,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
the functioning that occurs every day

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
with all the consequences.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
This can lead to sabotage,

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
but if they do not evaluate it,

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
why should I make any proposals?

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
The crisis of prohibitions can be overcome

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
by understanding,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
declaring and developing

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
the implementation of a common vision

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
that exists in the organization

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
to combine the ideas,

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
approaches that exist in the organization

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
so that it is possible to show,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
understand and accept the priorities

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
that exist at the moment

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
to develop investment plans,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
to develop plans for the implementation

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
of those or other achievements

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
that will be adopted,

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
approved and agreed

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
in order to ensure

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
that the process of distribution

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
and investment of funds

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
does not lead to the reduction of bills,

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
to the overtightening of the blanket,

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
to the non-working situation.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
This crisis of prohibitions,

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
as a result of any other crisis,

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
will either lead to a violation

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
of the system of organization

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
or will contribute to the development

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
of corporate vision, corporate mission,

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
corporate culture

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
and, accordingly,

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
to the pre-united organization of the collective

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
when everyone understands the essence,

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
the purpose, the purpose of their work,

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
the importance and significance of this work

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
for the work of the organization as a whole.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
The next stage of the organization's development

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
will be observed,

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
which Greiner calls the growth through cooperation.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
The coordination of the previous stage

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
was supposed to be the presence

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
of a certain external arbiter,

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
the head, the general director,

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
the deputy director,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
who takes on the function

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
of the executive branch.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
When it comes to cooperation,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
in this case, of course,

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
no one can cancel the role of the head,

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
but nevertheless, it is about the possibility

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
of the heads of different departments,

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
different regions, different regional directions

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
to agree on the prospects of further development,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
on the prospects of further growth,

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
because there is an understanding

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
that the work of each branch,

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
each department,

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
each department

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
is necessary for the unified system

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
of functioning of the organization as a whole,

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
for its further development,

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
for its economic growth,

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
for receiving dividends,

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
for receiving the desired results on the market.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Of course, this cooperation

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
can be accompanied by a crisis,

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
because all of us,

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
all the heads are subjective people,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
and not always,

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
as it is called in friends,

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
there is an agreement.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
But that crisis of trust,

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
that crisis of cooperation,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
which in this case can arise,

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
is a crisis that will be resolved at a different level.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
The organization has a long history.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
The organization has a history of victories,

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
a history of defeats,

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
and it already has authorities within this organization.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
And this crisis of cooperation

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
will significantly facilitate

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
the further development of the organization

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
and the change of this organization,

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
which will take place.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Very rarely this crisis of cooperation

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
can lead to negative results

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
related to what was received earlier,

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
what we talked about.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
If a leader comes from another company,

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
which is not a carrier of corporate culture,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
but a company that brings some new regulations,

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
then this is where the crisis of cooperation arises,

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
because there is a division

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
into old and new,

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
into our and not our.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
And this crisis can lead to negative results,

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
when a well-recommended company,

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
which has passed all five stages of its growth,

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
can, due to the fact that it is a company

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
that has been in a bad situation,

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
can, due to the fact that it is a company

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
that has been in a bad situation,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
can lead to very negative results,

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
which will be related to both

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
the loss of market positions

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
and the loss of reputation.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
And, accordingly, this is also the same crisis

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
that needs to be overcome.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
And, in fact, if the organization,

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
if the company has gone through all these stages of growth,

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
then this is an effective company,

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
this is a company that has proven its success,

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
this is a company that deservesly takes

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
the place in the market,

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
the segment of the market that it has.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
the segment of the market that it has.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
This is another growth model,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
and, accordingly, unlike the Danko model,

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
this is a more operational, more practical model,

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
which considers the steps and stages of growth.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
which considers the steps and stages of growth.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
And, according to the Greiner model,

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
it turns out that it is easy to control

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
the state, the stage of the organization's development,

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
which currently exists.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
Of course, there are other models

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
that you can read in the literature

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
that is offered to you for this course.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
But we will continue to look at

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
how the life cycle of the organization

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
is implemented.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
Here are the models that characterize

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
the development of the organization and its growth.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
At the same time,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
all the growth of the organization implies

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
that the company has a certain life cycle

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
that it goes through.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
It can go through crises,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
it can go through stages,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
but the life cycle of the organization

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
reflects the situation that any organization arises,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
any organization grows, gains experience,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
any organization reaches the zenith of its existence,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
and any organization falls apart,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
either ceases to exist

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
or turns into another organization.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
As for the life cycle of the organization,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
this model reflects

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
the obvious stages of the life cycle,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
which must be known and understood

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
in order to build a strategy

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
of organizational changes,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
because at each stage of this cycle

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
the organization will change,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and the strategy will be different.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
As for any organization,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
it starts with birth.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The organization arises to satisfy

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
the interests of a new buyer,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
it arises due to the provision of new services,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
it arises due to market requests.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The organization can arise only when

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
it is an economic formation

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
that arises depending on the economic requirements

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
and economic criteria that exist.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
The main goal of the organization

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
at the stage of birth is survival,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
as we have discussed earlier.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Any organization must fight

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
its place under the sun,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
because only in this case

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
it has prospects.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And, of course, at this stage

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
faith in success and willingness to risk

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
that exist in people

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
who created this organization is very important.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
At the stage of development,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
the ability to work is very important.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
This is the most difficult job

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
that we have discussed in the Danko model.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The next stage of the life of an organization

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
is childhood.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Since the organization is a living mechanism,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
all its stages of development

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
coincide with the stages of a person's life.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Childhood is a dangerous stage,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
because the organization already exists,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
it has already established itself.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But now we need to take care

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
of creating its structure,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
of forming its management,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
of achieving its controllability,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
of achieving its performance,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
of achieving the organization

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
to realize the tasks and functions

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
that are required of it

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
according to the requirements of the market.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
If at this stage

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
the management does not receive sufficient development,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
then the organization's childhood

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
can become its collapse.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Because if we did not leave our childhood,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
we did not receive further development.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
The next life cycle of an organization

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
is the youth of the organization,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
when there is a transition

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
from established complex management

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
from the period of its childhood,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
and this management is still implemented

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
in a small team.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Any newly born organization

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
is a small organization.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
At the stage of youth,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
there is a transition from the established complex management

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
to the creation of a team of like-minded people.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
The organization expands, new employees appear,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
new staff, new competence models,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
new functional requirements,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and, accordingly,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
now it is necessary to engage in such forms of management

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
as financing, planning and forecasting.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
The organization has reached the stage

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
of its accelerated active development.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Youth is the stage

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
when development is carried out as quickly as possible.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Now it is necessary to forecast,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
develop a strategy for further development,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
to prepare development plans,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
tactical plans, operational plans,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and, accordingly,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
a very important problem will be related to financing

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
all these stages of all this developed planning,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
the implementation of new,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
improved models of management,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
which will meet the requirements

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
of the organization.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
All this fits very well

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
in the model of Danko

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
with the stages of hard work,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
creating a myth,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
and in the stages of the development and growth of the Grainer organization,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
which we talked about earlier.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
If the stage of youth is successfully,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
constructively completed,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
then the stage of maturity comes,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
the zenith of the organization's development,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
when the indicators are balanced,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
when the niche in the market is occupied,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
when there are already

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
stable economic indicators,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
the organization's leadership is satisfied,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
developed, accepted,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
realized, and carried out management strategies.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
When strategic,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
promising plans are agreed upon

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and implemented,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and at the stage of maturity,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
the most important element is the adaptation

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
of the organization to the changes of the external environment.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
This is all that we talked about from the very beginning.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
If the organization wants to develop further,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
it must respond to the consumer's demand,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
to the market's demand,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
it must constantly pay attention

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
to the feedback

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
from the results it produces

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and from the product

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
it puts on the market.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
The stage of maturity is a long one,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
which indicates the successful

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and successful existence of the organization.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
The stage of maturity is marked

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
by three stages.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
The early maturity,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
the intermediate maturity,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and the final maturity.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
The early maturity is characterized

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
by a systematic growth of the organization.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
The organization is at the stage of maturity,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
but now it is not uncontrollably,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
not by chance, not by chance,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
but it grows systematically.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
There is a growth program,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
a development program.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
We know when the number of staff

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
will be increased,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
when the number of staff

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
will be sent to training,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and this is very important for the stage of maturity,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
as the organization will exist

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
and develop only until there are new plans

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
that need to be achieved.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
If there is a state of comfort,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
it is a state of stagnation and stagnation,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
which will lead to the destruction of the organization,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
as we have already mentioned.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
At the intermediate maturity stage,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
there is a constant response,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
a constant contact with the reality

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
that exists,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and there is a forecast

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
of how the organization

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
will change.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
There is a balance between what I have,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
between the requirements that are presented to me,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
and this balance is the golden ratio

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
that exists.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
As for the intermediate maturity,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
this is the golden ratio stage.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
We have already achieved the result,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
but we have plans to achieve new results

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
for our further expansion.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
The final stage is the final maturity,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
and this is the period

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
that is characterized by the creation

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
of the image of the organization,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
the creation of the brand of the organization,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
the creation of the myths

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
that we talked about

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
when we analyzed the Danko model.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
When we already create the history

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
of the success of this organization,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
we do not pay attention to these difficulties,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
we do not pay attention to the problems

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
that we face,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
but we do not forget that this is a list

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
of our successes,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
these are the stages of development,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
the achievements that we get.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Achievement after achievement,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
growth after growth,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
development after development.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
As for any organization,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
the more myths are created,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
the more brands and brands are present,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
the stage of the aging of the organization comes.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Aging, which is characterized

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
by bureaucratization.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
If the organization includes

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
a large number of units,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
if a large number of staff

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
works in the organization,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
then the organization must have

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
rules of management,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
rules of interaction,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
principles of movement of documents,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
documents of turnover.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
This is what is called bureaucracy.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Bureaucracy in a good sense of the word,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
because bureaucracy is an organization

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
of management that is aimed

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
at making necessary documents,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
necessary orders,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
necessary commands more quickly

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
implemented and reached the end result.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
As for bureaucratization,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
it is always a stick with two ends.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
At first, bureaucracy is useful,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
it avoids unnecessary agreements,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
it avoids unnecessary time loss,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
but when bureaucracy is already established,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
when bureaucracy is already,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
let's say,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
when bureaucracy is already a well-developed system,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
it begins to support itself.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And in this case,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
bureaucracy creates new instruments

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
to achieve the result.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
In any large organization,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
in order to get a certain offer

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
for development,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
a lot of agreements are required.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Legal services,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
economic services,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
financial services,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
economic services,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
security services.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
On the one hand, this is necessary,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
but on the other hand,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
time is lost,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
suddenness, surprise is lost.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
All that is very important for innovation,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
for obtaining and achieving market results.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Any large bureaucratic organization

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
is a slow and unsteady organization.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
In this sense,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
it, of course,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
has its own problems,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
where there is no agreement on documents,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
where everything is done on personal contacts,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
but we just said that 85-90% of newly created organizations

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
cease to exist.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
If the organization was among those

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
10% that survived,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
that exist,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
then to a certain extent it was done

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
by the legal and bureaucratic procedure.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
But the main task of the organization

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
at this time is to fight for survivability and stability.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
We have received serious results,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
but now these results

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
must not be preserved,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
but developed further.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And if the organization is stable,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
then there is a desire

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
not to lose what we have.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
With all the consequences that we have mentioned earlier.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
The aging of the organization has two outcomes.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Either the organization

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
will cease to exist,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
it will not necessarily go bankrupt,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
it will collapse,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
there will be a merger,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
there will be a change of activities,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
but it will no longer be the original

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
unified organization with its own history and success.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Or there will be a period of revival,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
when the organization,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
which has gone from birth to maturity,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
finds new spheres of development,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
new spheres of application of its results.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Often this is due to the fact that

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
a new team of managers comes to the organization.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It is the top managers.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And here is the problem

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
with growth through the cooperation of the agrarian sector,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
which we have just talked about.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Here, a crisis is possible.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Either this new team of top managers

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
will receive a mandate of trust with all the consequences

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
for the further development and growth of the organization,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
or this team of managers will not receive trust.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And accordingly, the organization

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
is already at the stage of aging,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
internal conflicts arise,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
internal contradictions,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
the attention to external objective indicators ceases to be paid,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
external economic factors,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and the organization continues to disintegrate.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Or the organization ceases to exist

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and there is a kind of a single system.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
The task of top managers,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
who have come to a successful company

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
at the stage of aging,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
in order to revive the organization,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
is to change the management structure,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
to create a new leader.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It does not matter who it will be.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
But it should be a new leader

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
who differs from the old one.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
A leader is always a personification,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
a person of the company, a person of its success,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
a person of the results it will get.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
This is what causes a shake in the organization.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Revival is that shake.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
If this shake exists,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
then the organization is proud

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
of all its successes,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
of all its myths,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and starts to create new myths.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
This is the life cycle of the organization,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
which is based on the models of the organization's growth

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
that we discussed.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
This life cycle of the organization

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
will be important for us

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
to consider how and at what stage

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
of this life cycle

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
the organization changes

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and what undercurrents exist.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
But we should pay attention

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
to the fact that every organization

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
is first of all a person.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I always say this idea

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
during our discussions.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Therefore, when we talk about the changes

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
in the organization,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
we should not think about the life cycle of the organization,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
but about the models of the organization's growth.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
They are not abstract,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
but they are implemented through the people

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
who work in the organization,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
through the staff of the organization.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
From the point of view of changes in the organization,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
the staff of the organization and the people

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
involved in it can be divided into two categories.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
The first category is the people who offer new

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and non-standard solutions to the problems

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
that have been and are still arising.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
These are people who creatively

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
approach the events

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and look for new and original solutions.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Unfortunately,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
the majority of such people

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
are people who are not

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
in the process of adapting to the existing

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
rules and standards.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It is clear to the human being.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
What I am adapting to has already

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
proved its fairness many times.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It has its pros and cons.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And I think that the people

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
who are adapting to it

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
are people who are not

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
in the process of adapting to the existing

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
rules and standards.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I think that the people who are adapting

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
to it are people who are not

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
in the process of adapting to the existing

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
rules and standards.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
What is better, to be an innovator or an adapter?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It is a difficult question.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
It all depends on the circumstances

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
of the market.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Depending on the circumstances

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
that exist inside the company,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
in each situation, you need both

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
an innovator and an adapter.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
For example,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
there was a leasing company.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
It was a successful leasing company.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
However, its success was largely

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
due to the fact that until 2005,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
there were very few leasing companies

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
in Russia.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
There was practically no competition.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Therefore, this company was one of

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
the leading positions in the Russian market

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
among a small number of other

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
leasing companies.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Accordingly, in this case,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
there were developed ways of signing

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
contracts, a developed line of

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
car transportation, which was

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
successful, which was in demand,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
which was in great demand among

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
legal entities.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
However, as for the legal side,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
there was a period of time

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
when the legal side was not

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
the same as the leasing side.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
This year, a large number of foreign

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
leasing players appeared in the Russian

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
market, which naturally made a

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
very significant competition

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
with the leasing company

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
that we are talking about.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
In this regard, the task of the

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
fight for the market was set.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
It was not just about maintaining

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
the existing results, not just about

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
buying the existing profits, but

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
also about increasing these profits.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Different solutions were sought.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
There were two main ways.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Some leasing companies thought that

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
the problem was that we needed to increase

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
the number of managers in the company

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
who would use the already developed

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
methods, the already recommended

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
forms of signing leasing contracts.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
The more of them there were, the more

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
we would increase the market segment.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Unfortunately, this approach, this

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
direction of development did not give

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
the desired result.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
For example, there was a company

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
that was very interested in buying

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
new leasing products.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
For the simple reason that other

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
leasing companies, especially foreign

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
ones, were bringing new, more

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
profitable contracts, new damping

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
prices, new damping contracts.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Accordingly, they were interested in

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
conquering the new Russian market.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
They offered a large number of leasing

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
products that turned out to be much

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
more competitive than the ones our

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
company had.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
In this regard, the adapters, consisting

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
of those people who did not want to

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
change the existing forms of contracts,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
existing terms of contracts, terms of

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
agreements, could not bring to the

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
positive results.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And the leasing company very quickly

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
lost not only the leading position,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
but also the invested funds, the

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
client base, and gradually it began to

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
lose the reputation it had.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
The situation changed after the

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
company came to the Russian market.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
The company was in the process of

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
changing its name.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
It was a company that understood that

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
the transfer of already approved methods

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
that were successful in 2005, 2006, and

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
even in early 2007, did not bring the

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
desired result.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
New competitive products, new

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
leasing contracts, new leasing

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
contracts, new leasing contracts,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
new leasing agreements, new leasing

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
programs, which will be competitive

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
compared to those products that

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
entered the market by foreign companies.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
These were innovators who perfectly

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
understood that in order to only

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
return the early economic results,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
it would take some time.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
And this is what happened.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
There was no other way, because the

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
old approaches carried out by the old

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
management, and even by adaptive

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
means, did not lead to the desired

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
result.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And after fundamentally new ideas

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
were proposed, responsibilities were

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
redistributed, new leasing contracts

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
were created, and the company was

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
able to return to the leading position.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
New divisions were created, new

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
structures were created, the process of

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
training managers was changed, the

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
processes of rewarding managers were

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
changed, the motivational scheme of

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
managers was changed. By the end of the

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
year, the situation began to change, and

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
our leasing company gradually returned

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
to the leading position. Of course, it

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
could not fully play back the lost

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
positions, but nevertheless, the results

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
that were obtained allowed the company

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
to exist further, and not to announce

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
bankruptcy, which was the point.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Here is the situation. If the innovators

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
came and started to carry out this

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
policy right away, maybe the results

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
would be different. It is difficult to say,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
because only after the management

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
of the company was convinced of the

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
inadequacy, the inefficiency of the

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
previously used means, it was forced to

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
go for new significant investment

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
and to replace the entire top management.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
This is, again, a painful process,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
and it is not easy to explain.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
However, in this case, we have achieved

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
the results. Therefore, when we talk about

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
innovators and adapters, the main

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
criterion here is the timing of these

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
changes, the presence of a plan of

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
changes, the coordination of those

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
indicators, which cannot be lowered,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
and the coordination of methods and

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
means of investing the results that

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
will take place.
