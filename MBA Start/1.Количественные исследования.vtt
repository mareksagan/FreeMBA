00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Good day, good time of day, as it is now customary to say.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
My name is Ulchenkov Arseniy.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
I will tell you about the application of the number of methods in business.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Of course, this topic is practically inexhaustible,

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
because any business that we do is somehow connected with numerical methods,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
with some numbers.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
I will try to tell you about three topics.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
This is about statistics, a little about linear programming

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
and about the modeling of the Monte Carlo method.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
I try to pay the most attention to statistics,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
since I believe that statistics are catastrophically undervalued in business,

00:41.000 --> 00:51.000
and the application of statistics can most quickly lead to the greatest profits for the business.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I chose the phrase of Milton Friedman, a famous economist,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
as the epigraph for this course.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
The phrase is, do not try to cross the river,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
only because its average depth is 4 feet.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Here, in particular, it is important to note that simple statistics,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
just average values, are not enough.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I think you will soon understand this.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Risk

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I will tell you a little about the origin of the concept of risk.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
The first attempt of the prognosis of the known humanity

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
refers to the second millennium of our era.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
It is described in the Indian treatise Mahabharata.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
There, the nectar says the following phrase,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
it sounds in English,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I have thus possessed the science, and in numbers was am skilled.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I have cognized the science of the lottery, and therefore I understand the numbers.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
This nectar comes to the king,

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
and says that he is able to estimate the number of leaves on a tree

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
by the number of leaves on a small branch.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
He counts the number of leaves on this tree, on a small branch,

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
then the king sends all his servants to count the real number of leaves,

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
and miraculously it turns out that the number of leaves differs from the predicted one by literally 2 or 3.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
This is the first attempt of a more or less scientific prognosis described in literature.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
People used devices for randomization,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
people understood the meaning of randomization a long time ago.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
If there was no randomization,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
everyone knows the story of a bulldozed donkey,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
which stands at an equal distance from two identical haystacks.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
This donkey must die of hunger,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
because the haystacks are the same,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
and it does not matter which one to go to.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
But if this donkey is a little hungry,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
it will be closer to one of the haystacks,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and thus it will be saved.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It is unlikely that such deep tasks are set before the donkey,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
but such tasks can be set before us as representatives of the Goma Sapiens.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
The first manifestations of the theory of probability,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
which are probably best manifested in insurance,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
were quite strange.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
The first understanding of a person,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
the manifestation of the theory of probability.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
The next example is called the Tverskaya dinosaur.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Everyone probably remembers this joke.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Those who do not remember, I refer to the Internet.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
The point is that when a blonde is asked

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
what is the probability that she will meet a dinosaur in Tverskaya,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
she says, one-second, either I will meet or I will not meet.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
So the first insurance contracts were built on this principle.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Going on a trip, the merchant bought insurance,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
the cost of which was equal to the cost of the expedition.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
If the expedition was lost,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
then he was returned both the insurance cost and the cost of the expedition.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Thus, the probability of an insurance case was considered to be one-second.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
That is, either I will meet or I will not meet.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
People have long been interested in probability,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
nevertheless, in many years,

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
the person did not have the sense organs responsible for recognizing probability.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I will try to show this on several examples.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Imagine that you come to an interview,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
you want to get a job you have long wanted.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
And the last phrase, the person with whom you go through the last round of the interview,

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
asks you, let's check you for math knowledge and good luck.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
He signs a contract on his side,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
takes a six-round revolver,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
loads two rounds in a row, the other four chambers are empty,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
spins the drum,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
presses the trigger,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
yes, he presents his signature on the contract,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
presses the trigger, there is no shot.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
And he says, ok, we checked you for good luck,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
you are all right with luck,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
now I want to check you for math knowledge.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
What do you think, is it better to spin the drum or not to spin it?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Or does it matter?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, here I would like you to stop and think,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
stop the lecture, perhaps.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
For those who are ready to answer right away,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I will tell you the correct answer.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
The drum does not need to be spun.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Here's the thing.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
In this case, people often confuse the concept of probability and conditional probability.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
In this case, the probability of the next shot,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
we have the probability of the next shot,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
on the condition that there was no shot the first time.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
In this case, looking at the drum of the revolver,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
we will understand that it could be either the first empty chamber,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
and when the drum is turned, there will be no shot the next time,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
or the second, and again, when the drum is turned, there will be no shot the next time,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
or the third, and there will be no shot,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
or the fourth, and then there will be a shot.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
That is, the shot will be in one case out of four.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
If you spin the drum, then the probability of losing 2 out of 6 is 1 third,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
1 third is obviously more than 1 fourth.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Therefore, it is advantageous for us not to spin.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
I am almost sure that most of you answered that it is better to spin the drum.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
This is another proof that it is quite difficult for people to reason in terms of probability.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Not only that.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Not only that is strange.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
For example, you are going to think about how to spend your vacation.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
You think that you are indifferent to how to spend it in the country, or to spend it in Turkey.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
You estimate the probability by 50%.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
But this does not mean that you can imagine yourself,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
50% of yourself in the country, and 50% of yourself in Turkey.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
This is impossible.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
You should always be in one place.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
Further, statistics, probability,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
well, in our misunderstanding of probability,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
such things as the impossibility of repeating events are involved.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
If someone remembers the deal program,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
it was on one of our channels for a very short time.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
I will not describe it, but I will describe the final state.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
The final state was that the possibility of winning,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
which the player can have,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
there were only three possibilities left.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
50,000 rubles, 1,000,000 rubles, and 3,000,000 rubles.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
And at that moment he was offered 450,000 rubles.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Is this fair? No, it is not fair.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Because the fair mathematical expectation of his winning is much greater.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
1,350,000 is the amount.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
And he is offered only 450,000 rubles, and he agrees.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Why?

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Because he understands the impossibility of repeating such an event.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
It is clear that if this event could be repeated as many times as possible,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
then, of course, it would be necessary to choose the continuation of the game.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
But since the repetition of events is absolutely impossible,

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
then a person chooses 450,000 just because it is a lot of money,

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
and he does not want to risk even the smallest possibility of reducing his winning.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
In addition, often what we consider to be equal is actually not equal.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
A very good example of this topic is described in the wonderful book by Perelman,

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Live Mathematics.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
The book was written at the beginning of the 20th century.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Nevertheless, the examples remain quite relevant to this day.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
For example, a student who is just starting to study the theory of probability

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
argues with a professor on a bicycle that among the 100 people who passed under the window

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
there will be at least one woman.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
The question is, what music should the student hear

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
to say completely lost, my bike is missing?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
The answer is actually simple, military music.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
The fact is that a battalion of soldiers passed under the window,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
which is clearly more than 100 people,

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
and of course there was not a single woman among the soldiers.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
This is due to the fact that often the things that we consider to be quite equal

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
are not really.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
I briefly talked about statistics,

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
what we will do, what we need to be afraid of.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Now I would like to talk about the tools that we will use.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The main tool used in this course,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
both in the course of statistics and in the continuation,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
will be Microsoft Excel.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Yes, this is really not a special statistical tool,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
but, first of all, it was chosen because,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
of course, any of you probably have it.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
And secondly, because special statistical tools

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
cost a lot of money,

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
and we would not want to encourage the purchase of pirated copies.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Microsoft Excel has developed into a very powerful program

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
since its inception,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
which includes a lot of features,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
really a lot.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Many neglect Excel, and in vain.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
We will, first of all, use in our course such functions as,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
speaking in Russian, linean,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
this is a function that describes linear regression,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
as a parameter selection, or goal seek, as it is called in English,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
as a search for a solution,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
in English it is called a solver,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
and most likely we will use such a function as a table of settings.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
In fact, this is an extremely useful thing.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I hope that after the end of the course,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
you will be able to use all these tools.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Probably, I need to say a few words about special statistical tools.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
Statistics is well implemented in programs developed by the SAS Institute.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
This is their whole series.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Not only SAS, of course.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Of course, this is also in mathematics,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
there is such a program developed by the company Wolfgram, in my opinion.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
Statistics is well done in Matlab, in Statistics, in SAS, and so on.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Probably the simplest student tool in statistics is the JumpIn program,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
also made by the SAS Institute,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
but with a focus on the student audience,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
so the cost is relatively low.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
As far as I remember, in Russia, unfortunately, it is not sold,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
but the cost of the student version is about $60-100, not expensive at all.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Of course, all other statistical programs are quite expensive.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Having said about the tools,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
we probably need to talk a little about data preparation.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
Data for statistics, for processing, is an extremely important thing.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
You need to pay a lot of attention to this.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Even if you are processing reference books,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
there can often be, for example, just prints.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
Or the person you asked to transfer data from the book to the Excel table will make a print.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Often, a person who is typing for a long time,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
it doesn't matter what he types, 178 or 187.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
And that's nothing, 178 and 187 are a small difference.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
The other thing is if he types 871 instead of 188.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And this will be a big problem.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
It will be much more difficult for you to assess such statistics.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
Nevertheless, with the right skill, you can prepare high-quality data.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Of course, when preparing data,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
you need to check all the suspicious values.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
There are often enough of these.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
The question of whether to exclude these values or not is not an easy one.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
The answer to this is that it depends on the data.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
It depends on whether you want to exclude or not exclude.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
If you are sure that such an observation will never happen again,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
then, okay, exclude it.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
But, for example, as in the case of the fall of the American market in October 1987,

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
no one can be sure that the American market will never fall by more than 20% or more.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Therefore, such observations must not be excluded.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
If the task requires smoother data,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
or the solution requires smoother data,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
you can smooth the data.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
In fact, this is not always good.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
We will now talk about the types of seasonality and its impact on business.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Of course, the main thing to do when preparing data

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
is to check whether your data agrees with your ideas about what should be there.

13:12.000 --> 13:21.000
As an example, if you suddenly see the dollar exchange rate at 6,000 rubles per dollar,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
you probably see data up to 1998,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
up to the moment when the ruble was denominated.

13:30.000 --> 13:38.000
Okay, here we need to make several definitions for statistics.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
We make the following definition.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
The general population is the entire set of observed objects or quantities.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
That is, if we are talking about all the military personnel,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
then these are just all the Russian military personnel.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
The selection is part of the general set selected for analysis.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
For analysis, we can select one of the units or one of the units of the armed forces,

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
or we can select one person from different units, different ranks of the troops, and so on.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
Depending on our task,

14:16.000 --> 14:27.000
it is quite likely that the second way, that is, to attract people from different units, will be more productive.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Another definition is the parameter.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
The parameter is an aggregated measure calculated to represent some general set.

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
Let's say, this can be the average weight of a soldier in the Russian Armed Forces.

14:41.000 --> 14:50.000
If we try to calculate this measure by selection, then such a measure is called statistics.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
We can select, for example, 50 people from the Russian Armed Forces, from different ranks of the troops, and so on,

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
calculate their average weight, and then their average weight will be some kind of statistics.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Of course, this will be some kind of approximation of the parameter.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
The more people we weigh, the closer we will be to the parameter.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
Nevertheless, even if we weigh all, but only almost all, soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces,

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
we will have only statistics, not the parameter itself.

15:21.000 --> 15:30.000
Here I would like you to read the CSBSP, and after you read it, we will talk about seasonality

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
and how this seasonality can be used in business for your own benefit.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Seasonality

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
Well, you read the case, now let's talk about what we see from it.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
The application, of course, has data on this case, I hope you managed to look at it.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
How good, our first question will be, how good are aggregated data?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
What can be seen from them?

16:06.000 --> 16:16.000
Let's say, if your chief of the ambulance service comes to you and reports that this month we have made 500 ambulances,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
is it good or bad?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, probably, in principle, not bad, yes.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
But what conclusions can you draw on the basis of this data?

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Not so much, you can just compare it with another month.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
You can say, yes, probably, compared to other months, this is not very much.

16:33.000 --> 16:42.000
Therefore, it is probably not very correct to draw conclusions on the basis of data per month.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
The data will actually tell you how to analyze them.

16:48.000 --> 16:59.000
And the seasonality that we are talking about, it is actually not only related to the change of seasons,

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
it is quite possible to consider, for example, a decrease in the number of ambulance calls,

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
since we are talking about ambulances, at the end of the month.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
For example, how can this be explained?

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
People work, people understand that by the end of the month they need to submit a plan,

17:18.000 --> 17:26.000
and people start to get sick less, simply because they attribute their illnesses to the future.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
This is one thing. But there is also such seasonality during the week.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
Seasonality is annual, that is, related to the change of seasons.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
There is also weekly seasonality, when we say that Monday is not hard for her.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
There is daily seasonality.

17:42.000 --> 17:51.000
It is clear that the number of calls between 1 am and 2 am is not equal to the number of calls between 1 pm and 2 pm.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
We talked a little about seasonality.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
How could we apply this seasonality now?

17:59.000 --> 18:10.000
Of course, at the same time, it is necessary to realize that the number of ambulance calls at any given moment is still an unusual number.

18:10.000 --> 18:19.000
To tell you about the order of the measure of the unusualness in the number of ambulance calls,

18:19.000 --> 18:34.000
I can tell you that in this case, on April 4, 2005, the company had 7 calls, and on April 4, 2005, it was 35.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Two adjacent days, nothing special, no difference.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
The number of ambulance calls was five times different.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
This is certainly an extreme case.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Nevertheless, the number of ambulance calls is random.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
This is inevitable.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
The more you look at each day separately, the more you will understand that this is a random number.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
However, this random number has clear patterns.

19:01.000 --> 19:09.000
If you can use them, your company will win significantly compared to your competitors.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Now we will move on to processing data.

19:15.000 --> 19:24.000
To be sure, I can tell you that in this case, in BSP, the company managed to achieve outstanding results.

19:24.000 --> 19:33.000
Compared to competitors who thought that it was possible to count on 4.5-5 calls per day for ambulance,

19:33.000 --> 19:47.000
BSP managed to achieve 6.22 in one month, which is approximately 24% more than the maximum dream of competitors.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
All this is done using conventional statistics.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
Okay, so we look at the data of the BSP case.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
First of all, if you were in Semyon's place, you would be offered something like this.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
This is a set of graphs that reflect the number of ambulance calls that were in a certain month.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
It all starts from 2001, goes on to 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
2005 is not finished, we have data for all months.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
What can you understand from them?

20:22.000 --> 20:31.000
On average, you can see that in the autumn and winter months, the number of ambulance calls is higher.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Yes, probably, on average, you can see that the number of ambulance calls is growing from year to year.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Perhaps, this is best seen on the second graph,

20:42.000 --> 20:51.000
which, in fact, linearly reflects all months of the BSP service, starting from July 2001.

20:52.000 --> 21:02.000
Here is the period of work of one director, the period of work of another director, the period of work of the third director, the period of work of the fourth director.

21:02.000 --> 21:12.000
In fact, all these falls can be considered as seasonal falls.

21:13.000 --> 21:21.000
We will discuss methods that will allow us to compare the work of at least two directors.

21:21.000 --> 21:29.000
Looking at this graph, which is equal to the monthly graph,

21:29.000 --> 21:38.000
it is unlikely that we will be able to make any serious detailed analytical studies of what is happening.

21:38.000 --> 21:47.000
It is obvious that in the winter months we would like to send more brigades to the front lines,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
but it is unlikely that we can draw any more serious conclusions.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Let's try to refer to the data itself.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
What does the data give us?

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
If you pay attention, you will see the date.

22:00.000 --> 22:13.000
For example, on July 1, 2001, we had a number of calls, 15 in total, and the time at which the call took place.

22:13.000 --> 22:25.000
As you can see, perhaps it is easy to notice that on July 1, 2007, the first call came at 8 a.m.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
How can we use this?

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
Let's try to use the means built into Excel, such as a table of settings.

22:38.000 --> 22:48.000
We will try to break our data into hours when the calls occurred,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
and add a column like the day of the week.

22:56.000 --> 23:04.000
The function in Russian Excel is called Day of No Day,

23:04.000 --> 23:15.000
and has a format of the day of the week, dates in the numeric format, and a type.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
We will use the second type.

23:20.000 --> 23:33.000
The second type means that the date is used in the format Sunday is the seventh day of the week.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Okay, we have a column Day of the Week.

23:43.000 --> 23:55.000
We assume that on Monday we will have a few more calls than on the rest of the week.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
We assume that on Saturday we will have a few fewer calls than on the rest of the week.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
The days of the week will be approximately the same.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Sunday will be a little harder than the average day of the week.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
How do we do it?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
We will use two things.

24:11.000 --> 24:21.000
We will use a table of settings, and we will use the functions that are called in Excel as a database.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
To do this, we must first define the database.

24:24.000 --> 24:31.000
Here it is, from A1 to E34703.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Thus, we have 34,702 records.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
This will be our database.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
We will sum up the number of calls that occurred on a certain day of the week.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
To do this, we need to make a criterion.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
We take the title of the column.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Here we will write the criterion.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
The criterion, for example, is the day of the week 1, that is, Monday.

24:59.000 --> 25:11.000
In this cell, we will record the number of calls that occur on Monday over our almost 5 years of observation.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
We will use the best shot function,

25:18.000 --> 25:29.000
which will read the number of records in the database that satisfy a certain criterion.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
We have marked the database.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We will count the field.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
In fact, since this is a calculation, not a summation, we will count the field day of the week.

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
And we will choose the criterion that the day of the week is equal to Monday.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
OK. We press Enter.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
And we get that on Monday we had 6,052 calls.

25:54.000 --> 26:01.000
If we change it to 2, we get the number of calls on Tuesday.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
3 on Wednesday.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
4 on Thursday.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
5 on Friday.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
6 on Saturday.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
Note that the number of calls on Saturday is lower than the number of calls on a regular day, and even lower than the number of calls on Monday.

26:17.000 --> 26:27.000
And 7 will be our Sunday, which, if you pay attention, is slightly higher than, although in this case, oddly enough, slightly lower than the average day.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
OK. As you can see, we had to change all the values of the day of the week.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
Is there a better way? Is there a possibility to use any other Excel feature?

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Yes, there is.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
We can use the so-called data table.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
What is a data table?

26:47.000 --> 26:56.000
A data table is a kind of macro that will substitute all the necessary values for you and sort out all possible options.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
In our case, when the day of the week is only 7, it is not so difficult.

27:00.000 --> 27:08.000
But a little further we will consider much more difficult possibilities and see that the table of settings is a very useful thing.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
OK. How can we use the table of settings?

27:16.000 --> 27:24.000
We will make links to the number of days.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
Why? In this cell, Excel will substitute different days numbers from 0 to 7.

27:31.000 --> 27:38.000
Accordingly, in this cell, Excel will issue the number of calls on the corresponding day, from 1 to 7.

27:44.000 --> 27:55.000
We select a field with the numbers that denote two weeks, with the cell where Excel will substitute the data that denotes our days of the week.

27:56.000 --> 28:05.000
At the top of the second column, we leave a cell where Excel will write the data corresponding to our days of the week.

28:05.000 --> 28:12.000
And we select the data, work with data, the data table.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
In the previous version of Excel, this was called the table of settings.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
In the new translation, it is called the data table.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
In fact, the data table is a more accurate translation.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
In English, it is called the data table.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Although, in fact, it is a table of settings.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
We click on the data table.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
There is a small feature.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Here we have a column.

28:38.000 --> 28:45.000
We need to select this row of data, we need to select, substitute the value in lines.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Why in lines? It is not very clear, but nevertheless.

28:49.000 --> 29:03.000
As you can see, the number of emergency calls in these cells has increased, corresponding to the days of the week, starting from Monday to Sunday.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
We can look at the schedule.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
In the new Excel, it is located here.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
We want to build a so-called point diagram, or scatter plot, as it is called in English.

29:16.000 --> 29:26.000
That is, a diagram where we will have numbers of days of the week on one axis, and the number of calls corresponding to this day of the week on the second axis.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
It is better to take the connected points, for example, this or this schedule.

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
It is easy to see that Monday is the day that stands out among the others.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
Friday is a little better than other days.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
Saturday is a little better in terms of people getting sick less.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
And Sunday is about the same as a regular day of the week.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
Is it enough? I will destroy this schedule, if you don't mind.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
You can easily restore it.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Is this statistic enough for us?

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
Yes, we now see that on Saturday we can release fewer cars on the line.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
And on Monday, we should release more cars.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But maybe this is not all.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Maybe we can do something better.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
Let's try to do the following.

30:25.000 --> 30:37.000
Let's try to add another variable and build the number of calls per day, per week and per hour.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
We add another variable here in the criteria.

30:42.000 --> 30:50.000
And in the formula B-calculation, we change the reference to the criteria from H1 to H2

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
to such a reference that it captures cells from G1 to H2.

30:56.000 --> 31:13.000
Now, when we press Enter, our formula will read the number of calls that occurred between 8 and 9 a.m. on Monday.

31:14.000 --> 31:25.000
Since we have 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, we understand that 7 times 24 is 168.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
It would be extremely difficult for us to go over 168 options.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Therefore, we will use the table of the settings again.

31:35.000 --> 31:45.000
We write the number from 0 to 23, which corresponds to our hours.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
23.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
And the number corresponding to our days of the week, from 1 to 2.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Oh, sorry, from 1 to 7, of course.

31:58.000 --> 32:07.000
Once again, we enter the number of calls corresponding to this hour in the upper part of the table.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Here we make references to the day of the week.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
And here is a reference to the hour.

32:20.000 --> 32:33.000
In cell G9, we will place a reference to the number of days, and in cell G8 a reference to the number of hours.

32:33.000 --> 32:43.000
At the same time, cell H2, that is, the day of the week, refers to cell G9, and cell G2 to cell G8.

32:44.000 --> 32:51.000
In fact, we can directly substitute the values that we will use in the table of the settings.

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
But for convenience, we will simply rewrite them so as not to follow them throughout the table of our Excel.

32:59.000 --> 33:08.000
Thus, we mark the rectangle that includes our days and hours.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
At the top of it, we write the value of the corresponding number of calls.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
And we click on the data again.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
Working with data in the table of data.

33:20.000 --> 33:29.000
Now we substitute the value for the columns in cell G9 and the value for the columns in cell G8.

33:30.000 --> 33:38.000
Please note that it took Excel literally three seconds to calculate a huge table.

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
You would have to read such a table without using these tools for several days.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
Now we can do the following.

33:49.000 --> 33:59.000
We can sum up the values for the hours.

33:59.000 --> 34:09.000
And so we get the number of calls corresponding to a certain hour.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
And we can sum up the values for the days of the week.

34:16.000 --> 34:23.000
And so we get the number of calls corresponding to a certain day.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
If you remember, 6,052.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
And we really have 34,702 calls.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Let's check here.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Is this correct?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
34,702 calls.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Fair.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
Now we need to build a schedule depending on the number of calls in a certain hour.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
For this we need to mark two columns.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
The first column is 0,23.

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
And the last column with the number of calls depending on the hour.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
We make the insertion again.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
A dotted schedule.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
It's better to make a smooth dotted line.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
This is how the number of calls looks like depending on the hour.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
Now what can we do with such a schedule?

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
Of course, the ambulance is used to working 24 hours a day.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
And yes, of course, the ambulance should be available at any time of the day.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
So the first few machines...

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
Imagine that we fill this schedule with the cubes representing our machines.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
The first line representing one machine will fill this part of the schedule.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
The second line will fill some more part of the schedule.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
By the way, it would be possible to stop with daily machines.

35:45.000 --> 35:54.000
But since you have a part of the schedule between 6 and 22 hours,

35:54.000 --> 36:01.000
it's unlikely that it's convenient for your ambulance workers.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
So you need to add two more ambulances that will work 24 hours a day.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
But if you add the fifth ambulance that will work 24 hours a day,

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
you will see that this fifth ambulance will not pay itself.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.000
Since the ambulance workers will have to pay for the full day.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
And they will work only between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
Therefore, it is more logical to make the fifth ambulance not 24-hour, but 12-hour.

36:34.000 --> 36:45.000
So you are representing this area with the cubes that represent the ambulance machines.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
By filling it up, you will get the optimal solution.

36:49.000 --> 36:56.000
It would be more logical to make two ambulances that would work for 3 hours in this place.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
But it's impossible, so you will have to make a machine that will work 8 hours a day.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
By using such simple methods,

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
reducing the number of cars when they are not needed,

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
and increasing the number of cars when they are needed,

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
the company has achieved a 24% superiority compared to the dreams of other companies.

37:19.000 --> 37:27.000
I think this is a convincing proof that any manager in the workplace

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
should use at least minimal statistics skills.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
First of all, the statistics are descriptive.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
Thus, we have made sure that aggregated data is not so good.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
On their basis, we cannot draw serious conclusions.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
And we understand perfectly well that such a thing as seasonality,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
yes, it is harmful, of course,

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
because it makes your enterprise work unevenly.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
But the influence of seasonality, thank God, can be reduced.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
And the influence of seasonality, let's say,

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
in some sense, can even be of some use.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
For example, in the competition.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
For example, you decide, as in the conditions of the previous case,

38:11.000 --> 38:17.000
you decide that since your cars are not loaded at night,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
you decide to make a discount.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
What will happen next?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
More people will turn to you at night.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Accordingly, after a while, your competitors,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
realizing that their cars do not work at night,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
will leave the business at night.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
And their cars, their bricades, will bring less income.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
And who actually needs an ambulance that does not work 24 hours a day?

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
An ambulance, not a 24-hour ambulance, is basically nonsense.

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
This is how you can influence your understanding,

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
your understanding of statistics, not only on your business, but also on someone else's business.

38:53.000 --> 39:00.000
Okay, we have now disassembled what is called descriptive statistics.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
We will look at it in a little more detail.

39:05.000 --> 39:13.000
After all, who actually told us that the differences that we see in the data for Monday,

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
who actually told us that this is not the result of any accident?

39:18.000 --> 39:27.000
For example, you buy a lottery ticket and win 100 rubles.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
How likely is this win?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Extremely unlikely, in fact.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
If you bought a ticket for 1 ruble and won 100 rubles,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
the probability of this is very small.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
It cannot be concluded from this that the next time you buy a lottery ticket for 1 ruble,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
you will win 100 rubles again.

39:43.000 --> 39:50.000
It would be less strange if the lottery organizers gave you such an opportunity.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
An ambulance is also a lottery ticket in a sense.

39:53.000 --> 40:00.000
Although, of course, those people who call an ambulance would not want to win in this way.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
But from your point of view, when you are an ambulance worker,

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
this is an opportunity to justify your existence, an opportunity to earn money.

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
Thus, we need to check how different the data are from each other in reality

40:18.000 --> 40:25.000
and how right we are to say that Monday is a hard day.

40:25.000 --> 40:34.000
We will look at this data from the point of view of testing the hypothesis.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
What happens when testing the hypothesis?

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
What should you do when testing the hypothesis?

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
You should formulate a zero hypothesis.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
For example, a zero hypothesis can look like this.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
I believe that the average salary of an analyst, for example,

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
a financial analyst, is 40 thousand dollars a year or 40 thousand rubles a month.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
This is not a principle.

41:04.000 --> 41:10.000
What should we do next?

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
We should formulate and determine the appropriate statistics.

41:17.000 --> 41:25.000
To determine the appropriate statistics, we should apply the appropriate parameter

41:25.000 --> 41:34.000
and the appropriate distribution in order to compare the value of statistics

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
with the one we calculate during the preparation of our data.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
We should also choose the level of significance.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
What is the level of significance?

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
The level of significance is, to put it simply, the quality of your decision.

41:48.000 --> 41:54.000
If you want to be 95% sure that some random factors did not affect your decision,

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
then the level of significance is 5%, respectively, 1-95%.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
If you want to be absolutely sure, or almost absolutely sure,

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
in statistics you can hardly use the word absolutely sure,

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
if you want to be 99.9% sure, then you need to choose a slightly different level of significance.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
Then you should formulate the decision-making rule.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
This decision-making rule depends on the distribution and your standard deviation,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
which is obtained as a result of the calculation.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
After that, you should collect the data, calculate the statistics and make a decision.

42:31.000 --> 42:38.000
We will consider this using the example described in the Excel file,

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
which is called the example, and the example is called the salary.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
We are considering the example of the salary.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
We have a set of data, about 200 measurements.

42:49.000 --> 43:01.000
We are considering the fact that the average salary is 40,000 rubles per month.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
The statistic that can be used in this case is the T-statistic.

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
If we do not know the distribution of the salary level,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
then we have to apply the T-statistic.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
We choose the level of significance at 5%,

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
that is, we want to be 95% sure that our salary falls into this interval.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
Accordingly, our decision will be, we accept the zero hypothesis.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
Okay, we don't quite accept it, we need to make a deal.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
The fact is that from the point of view of statistics,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
it would be right to say that we cannot refute the hypothesis.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
We do not accept it, it is just possible that we do not have enough data,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
we cannot refute it.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
But sometimes I will say that we accept it.

43:44.000 --> 43:53.000
We accept the hypothesis if it falls into the interval approximately minus 1.96 plus 1.96 standard deviation.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
In fact, there is a slight difference,

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
but with a large number of changes, approximately more than 30,

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
we have the right to use the so-called normal distribution.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
For a normal distribution with corresponding critical values,

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
it will be minus 1.96 plus 1.96 standard deviation.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
Accordingly, let's now look at the data that we have described in the example

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
and try to make the corresponding calculations.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
Okay, this way we look at the example of the salary.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
You will find it in the workbook of the example.

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
Here, using the random number generator and what we call the Monte Carlo method,

44:42.000 --> 44:56.000
200 different financial analysts with a salary that fluctuates within,

44:56.000 --> 45:05.000
if you pay attention, from 16,732 rubles to 63,819 rubles per month.

45:06.000 --> 45:15.000
In fact, we generated a distribution with the following indicators.

45:15.000 --> 45:22.000
It should have been a normal distribution with an average value of 40,000 rubles

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
and a standard deviation of 10,000 rubles.

45:25.000 --> 45:35.000
A normal distribution in this case means that in plus or minus two standard deviations,

45:35.000 --> 45:54.000
that is, plus or minus 20,000, we should get about 95, 96.8 values of our measurements.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Okay, what are we doing here?

45:56.000 --> 46:05.000
We show how we will check our hypothesis.

46:05.000 --> 46:11.000
In this case, let's look at this table.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
What is happening here?

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
We made four different selections of 50 values.

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
The first is from B2 to B51, the second is from B52 to B101, and so on.

46:23.000 --> 46:29.000
We calculated the average value of the salary for these selections

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
and calculated the standard deviation for these selections.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
Having calculated these standard deviations, we used them as follows.

46:40.000 --> 46:47.000
Subtracting the average value from the assumed, hypothesized, that is, 40,000,

46:47.000 --> 46:55.000
we divide the deviation by the corresponding value of the number of measurements.

46:55.000 --> 47:07.000
If the result exceeds 1.96, we have to state that...

47:07.000 --> 47:15.000
Okay, not 1.96, to be completely precise, 2.01.

47:15.000 --> 47:25.000
If our result exceeds this value, we have to state that we refute the fact

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
that the average value of the salary is 40,000.

47:32.000 --> 47:42.000
I remind you that we tried to generate a group of people with a salary,

47:42.000 --> 47:56.000
and in fact, in each case, we had to refute the fact that the average salary is 40,000.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
However, as a result of randomness, when using the random number generator,

48:02.000 --> 48:13.000
we observe that we have to refute the fact that the average salary is 40,000.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
This does not happen very often.

48:15.000 --> 48:23.000
For your convenience, I left a formula in the last cell, which will generate such a contingent.

48:23.000 --> 48:31.000
If we copy this formula again, we will notice that in all cells,

48:31.000 --> 48:37.000
by pressing the F9 button, you will count, that is, every time you will get 200 new people.

48:37.000 --> 48:45.000
Please note that the number of people in this line does not appear so often, more than two.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
We will have to suffer for a long time.

48:50.000 --> 48:59.000
Here, for the first time, after about 9 clicks, we have a number greater than 2.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
This does not happen so often.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
On the other hand, in the upper cell, in the upper table, where the number of measurements is less,

49:06.000 --> 49:16.000
there is a slightly higher critical T, but such cases occur more often.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
This is due to the fact that since the number of measurements is less,

49:20.000 --> 49:30.000
the sum of the smaller number of random values is more random than the sum of the larger number of random values.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
Let's try to pay attention to the upper cell.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
We will expect values greater than 2.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Again, we will press F9.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
Here, already at the first click, we have, if you see, in the upper left cell,

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
the value of the formula for more than 2 has appeared.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
With the second click, there is no such value.

49:53.000 --> 50:01.000
In fact, such cases will occur much more often than in the previous variant.

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
We were able to look at the hypothesis test.

50:08.000 --> 50:18.000
Now we better understand that even if our population is large enough,

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
and even if we made a big choice,

50:21.000 --> 50:32.000
nevertheless, sometimes, choosing from a population with an average value that is really equal to the assumed one,

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
we will make a choice that we will have to draw a conclusion based on this choice

50:38.000 --> 50:44.000
that the average value of the population differs from the one we imagined.

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
It makes sense to talk about why a manager should know statistics.

50:51.000 --> 50:59.000
I think we have already discussed some of the applications of statistics.

50:59.000 --> 51:06.000
First of all, statistics should be known in order to give the appropriate description and representation of data,

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
as in the case of the BSP case.

51:11.000 --> 51:17.000
If we cannot represent data as we should represent it in order to make the right decision,

51:17.000 --> 51:24.000
then, of course, none of us, be it us or the BSP, will be able to make any decision.

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
Of course, these decisions can be made intuitively,

51:30.000 --> 51:37.000
but much more accurate and correct decisions will be made if you can support these decisions with some data.

51:37.000 --> 51:44.000
Next, statistics are necessary in order to draw conclusions about the population based on the data about the choice.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
For example, you are a commander of a paratrooper platoon,

51:47.000 --> 51:56.000
and you need to load a helicopter with 4,000 kilograms of paratroopers.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
You do not know, you cannot weigh them,

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
so you have to make some simple assumptions.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
For example, you can know how much a paratrooper weighs on average.

52:12.000 --> 52:19.000
If a paratrooper weighs 80 kilograms, then 50 paratroopers will be about 4,000 paratroopers.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
We will look at this in more detail a little later.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
Nevertheless, this is a conclusion about the population based on the data about the choice.

52:29.000 --> 52:39.000
Next, as in the case of the BSP, you can and should use statistics to optimize the operational processes.

52:39.000 --> 52:49.000
This is a direct consequence of using statistics to describe and present data.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
Another thing is that statistics are used for reliable forecasting.

52:56.000 --> 53:03.000
When I just started teaching statistics, I asked for data from one of my friends.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
At that moment, he had a small computer store.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
He showed me his data and said something like this.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Look, it was in November.

53:13.000 --> 53:20.000
Look, I have December 2003 and December 2004.

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
I connect these two December lines and he got a very good growth.

53:25.000 --> 53:33.000
He expected that sales would be more than in November, about four times.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
Maybe three.

53:34.000 --> 53:45.000
He drew a conclusion about a certain business increase based on only two points.

53:46.000 --> 53:53.000
I said to him, Sergey, maybe we should try to take into account the influence of all the other data.

53:53.000 --> 54:06.000
After all, in the sales data of the other months, there is also data about the future sales of your store.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
To which he waved his hand, of course.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
You don't understand anything.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
How can you understand?

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
This is a reliable statistic.

54:13.000 --> 54:21.000
Unfortunately, my right was confirmed.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
Sales were a little bit less than in December.

54:26.000 --> 54:34.000
Just a few days before the recording of this lecture, I received new data from Sergey.

54:35.000 --> 54:42.000
What's interesting, he called me and said, how do you do it?

54:42.000 --> 54:49.000
I looked at the data for January 2007 and your forecast was different from the real data by 500 rubles.

54:49.000 --> 55:00.000
As a result, a person who was really a skeptic about statistics for two years,

55:00.000 --> 55:08.000
now he is a convinced supporter of statistics, but he still accepts such a thing as forecasting.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
We'll talk about forecasting a little later.

55:12.000 --> 55:19.000
First, we will describe a simpler example.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Imagine that your company plans to rent a new office.

55:24.000 --> 55:34.000
The director, who has no time to do this, asked you and another employee to estimate the cost of the rent, depending on the area,

55:34.000 --> 55:43.000
and to assume what price you can offer for a specific office during the negotiations.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
Your colleague, not listening to the course, offers to take all the existing data,

55:50.000 --> 56:01.000
that is, to sum up the cost of the entire rent, and divide it by the total area.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
Thus, you will get the average cost per square meter.

56:05.000 --> 56:23.000
You ask yourself, imagine a hypermarket, such as Oshan, a huge area of several tens of thousands of square meters.

56:23.000 --> 56:31.000
Do they take the same rent from Oshan and from the kiosk that sells juice there?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Apparently, no.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
However, your colleague offers to average this. Is this good?

56:37.000 --> 56:45.000
Is there a better way? Is there a way to correct your colleague? Is there a way to give a more accurate prediction of the cost?

56:45.000 --> 56:51.000
First, we will use linear regression in Excel.

56:51.000 --> 56:58.000
It is described as a function line-est, or, accordingly, line-in in Russian.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
The function uses the following arguments.

57:01.000 --> 57:13.000
This is a known column of y's, a known column of x's, which, by the number of lines, must coincide with the number of y's.

57:13.000 --> 57:21.000
And then there are two parameters, one of which makes the regression line go out of zero,

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
or you can somehow make it higher or lower than zero.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
And the last parameter is the conclusion of the statistics.

57:29.000 --> 57:38.000
Since we are interested in statistics, we will always set the last two parameters to be equal to one.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
In addition, a big request is to remember such a combination of keys.

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
When you write the function line-in, you describe everything neatly.

57:49.000 --> 58:04.000
Then, depending on the number of variables used, you need to mark the rectangle with a size of 5 lines in height and n plus 1, where n is the number of variable columns in width.

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
There should be a formula in the upper left cell.

58:10.000 --> 58:16.000
And then you must press F2 at the same time, and then press CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER at the same time.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
By remembering this magical combination of keys, you can always use the statistics function.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
Now we will move on to the example of the office rent.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
We look at the example of the office rent.

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
We have two columns, which are called the area and the cost of the office rent per year.

58:37.000 --> 58:48.000
Let's try to build a graph of the cost of the rent versus the area of the office.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
In any case, the graph is useful, it will not prevent us.

58:54.000 --> 59:00.000
It will take some time, but I think that time will not be wasted.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
Once again, we choose a point diagram.

59:05.000 --> 59:11.000
You can choose a smooth one, but in this case it is better to choose points.

59:11.000 --> 59:20.000
As you can see, our points, from all points of view, more or less lie on one straight line.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
But the question arises, how will we draw this straight line?

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
You may have your own ideas, for example, you can draw it along the upper edge.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I have my own.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
Thus, you need to agree on the methods of drawing this straight line.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
This is one.

59:36.000 --> 59:44.000
And two, do not forget about your colleague, who, like the balls, offers to fold and divide everything.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Let's do this first.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Let's fold and divide.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:08.000
We get the sum of all costs, and we get the sum of all areas.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Thus, dividing the sum of all costs by the sum of all areas, we get the average cost per square meter.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Thus, the average cost per square meter per year is $ 392.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Is this a lot or not?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Let's compare.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Let's create another column, the cost of one square meter per year.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It is clear how to create it.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000
We need to divide the cost by the number of square meters.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Now, of course, it was possible to stretch it, I think you all know how to stretch a cell.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But for simplicity, there is such a thing as CTRL D.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And our formula is copied throughout the cell.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Now let's build a graph of the cost of one square meter depending on the area.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
After all, it is clear that the area most likely affects the cost of one square meter.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
We choose the insertion point graph.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
We look at the point graph again.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And as you can see, the cost of a square meter is slightly reduced from the area.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I would even say that there is some curvature here, let's say, as a unit divided by x.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But we will not pay attention, we will draw a more or less straight line.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
However, we will start by drawing a straight line.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:02.000
A straight line is not our graph of the cost of a square meter per year, depending on the area,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
but a straight line of the cost of renting an office, depending on the area.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Here it is all described in practice.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I will show you again how it is done.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I remind you that the function is called Linein.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
The format of the function is as follows.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:34.000
As known values, we substitute the known value y, that is, the cost of renting an office.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:43.000
As known values, we substitute the area of ​​our office.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And then, here we will always have 1 and 1.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:58.000
The first unit means that we allow Excel to use the constant,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and the second unit means that we want Excel to display statistics.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
We got one value.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
But since Linein is a so-called array function,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
we will now do the following.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
As I said, we will mark 5 lines, a rectangle with a height of 5 lines and a width of n plus 1,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
that is, in this case n is equal to 1, and a width of 2 columns.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Now we press the F2 button and then press the key combination.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
At the same time, press CTRL, SHIFT and ENTER.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Here you see, the entire statistics that is given by the function Linein.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Here this statistic is described.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
What is 374?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
This is the slope of our line.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That is, our line has, with the increase in the area by 1 square meter,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000
the rent cost on average increases by $ 374 per year.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
What is the intercept?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Intercept is such a strange value,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
this is the value at which our line crosses the y-axis.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
What is its physical meaning?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Often it has no physical meaning.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
In this case, however, imagine that you want to rent 1 square meter of area.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
The cost of 1 square meter of area will be intercept plus about 1 meter.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
In total, it will be $ 11,895.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:40.000
If you are in business, then you obviously know that some companies provide such a service as a legal address rent.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Without the area.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So you can discuss the intercept in this case as the cost of the legal address rent.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
That is, you rent a room, but the area of ​​this room is not.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
As it often happens in the case of a legal address rent.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Let's look at other indicators.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000
This and this are standard errors in determining the slope and intercept.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000
That is, the height above or below the level of 0.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Going a little further, I will show this statistic.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:31.000
In this case, we use a hypothesis that the slope is 0 and the intercept is 0.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:43.000
By dividing the slope into the standard error in its definition, we get a statistic that shows how different it is from 0.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
In this case, we are 100% sure that the slope of this line is different from 0.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
As for the intercept, everything is not so clear here.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But nevertheless, this statistic is good enough, it is more than 2.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000
We believe that the intercept is significantly different from 0.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
What is r2?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I will format it so that it is convenient to read.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
r2 is the indicator of the quality of regression.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
In principle, its physical meaning is the square of the coefficient of correlation.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000
It is important that r2 is within the range from 0 to 1.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
The higher r2, the better our regression.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
34,843 is a standard error in determining y.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:49.000
To make it clear how to apply it, imagine a line that is given by this equation.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
y is equal to 11,521 plus 374 times x, where x is the area.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Taking two standard errors from it up and down, we get a line that, as we are sure, gets 96% of all observations.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.000
This is a fairly wide band, but if you pay attention, our last values are quite large, 580,000.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
For such values, the standard deviation is relatively small.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
F-statistics is an indicator of how much we have.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
In principle, our regression describes something.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000
In fact, for such values, F-statistics is already good enough for more than 4.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
2000 is just great.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
96 is the number of degrees of freedom.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
97 is the number of degrees of freedom, which is equal to n-1.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
We will not go into details here.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Nevertheless, we can say that r2 can be calculated from these two values.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Why does Excel give it?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Well, it's the tenth.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Apparently, Microsoft had some considerations in programming.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Okay, so, back to our task.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I remind you that your boss asked you to estimate how much you will get for renting an office.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Now you can tell him that the rent of the office will cost us $ 11,521 plus about $ 370 per square meter.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
This will be the best estimate of the cost of renting an office.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:43.000
If you rent a large office, it is quite likely that your friend is right.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But if you rent a small office, you will never be able to rent it,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000
because the estimate of your employee is significantly lower than the cost of renting.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:07.000
If the office is large enough, then your colleague offers you $ 392,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
while in fact each additional square meter costs only $ 374.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The difference is $ 18, and if the area of the office is large enough, the difference can be significantly accumulated.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Okay, as we have seen, Excel statistics gives us a sufficient set of values,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
which we can later apply to predict some quantities.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Of course, on the condition that we believe in forecasting,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:44.000
on the condition that we believe that the experience we have observed in the past is transferred to what we will observe in the future.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I think it is important to say that there are two types of two different quantities in randomness.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
This is probability and uncertainty.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Probability is when you toss a coin and, depending on the outcome, do something or not do something,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
or something happens, something does not happen.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Uncertainty is when you toss a coin and a cube falls.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
If you used to think that there were only two possible outcomes,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
then a cube has six possible outcomes.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
The thing is that you have not yet observed in this life.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000
For example, in ancient times, people were sure that all swans were white.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
There was even a saying that it was as impossible as a black swan.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
When people got to Australia, they found that there was a population of absolutely black swans.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:53.000
In this regard, it is quite possible that our knowledge of the world simply does not incorporate the information that we have observed.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
If we have not observed it, we cannot incorporate it.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
If you have never seen a black swan, you will think that all swans are white.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Let's go back to statistics.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I mean the statistics given by the function xl linearly.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Again, slope is the slope of a straight line, intercept is the value of y at the point where the line of our statistics intersects,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
in this case, the axis y.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
This is actually what we will use the most.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And again, the best prediction of the value of the function at any point x1 is y from x1 equals intercept,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:41.000
that is, the value at the point where the line intersects the axis y, plus the coefficient of regression multiplied by x1.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:49.000
The basis of regression, let's say, the basis of obtaining high-quality regression results, lies in four main assumptions.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
The first assumption is the assumption of the linearity of the connection between an independent variable and an independent variable.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
In this case, considering the example of an office, an independent variable is the area of ​​the office,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
an independent variable is the cost of renting this office per year.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
The assumption of linearity of the connection is not very strong.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Not very strong in the sense that we can easily eliminate nonlinearity.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Or, let's say, if we cannot eliminate nonlinearity, we can always choose a fairly small area

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:33.000
so that in this small area, in this small piece, our function is linear or we could consider it linear.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Of course, if you recall the parabola, x2 from the school course,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000
if you take it as a symmetrical, then what regression can you do?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Only such a horizontal line, since it is symmetrical.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000
However, if you take one of the branches of the parabola, it will be much easier to draw a line.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Although, of course, a straight line is not a very good approximation of a parabola.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Then there is such a mandatory condition, or let's say one of the four main conditions.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
The second one has a terrible name.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
This is the condition of the absence of heteroscedasticity.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Or, if you like, the presence of homoscedasticity.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
What is heteroscedasticity?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:27.000
This is a variety of variations along the axis of an independent variable.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I will show several examples a little later.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Now I can say the following.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
If your points are scattered relative to the line relatively symmetrically,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and the distance at which they are scattered relative to the line does not depend on the value x,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
then, thank God, you do not have heteroscedasticity.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
If, for example, the points with an x-axis begin to scatter more and more,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
then it makes sense to talk about heteroscedasticity.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.000
But heteroscedasticity also does not make very strong limitations.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Let's put it this way.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
There are two types of heteroscedasticity.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
One of them is eliminable.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Thank God, it is outside this course.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
The second is not eliminable.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Nevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn even in the case of strong enough heteroscedasticity.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
The third main assumption based on linear regression

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
is the absence of correlation of the remains.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
What does this mean?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:42.000
The remains are the difference between your predicted value in the point and the observation in the point itself.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Having built a whole set of such remains,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
you can see whether these remains fit into any line.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
If your remains fit into a simple parable,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
then it simply means that you did not take into account something in your regression.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
If your remains fit into a more smooth curve,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
a periodic curve,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
it is quite likely that there is some seasonality

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
or some other influence that you can eliminate.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Or, most often, you do regression for time.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
It is not a very good idea to do regression for time,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
using time as an independent variable.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Nevertheless, we will have to do it once or twice.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
We will consider that our results are good enough,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
despite the fact that we do regression for time.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000
The fourth condition is the condition of normal distribution of the remains.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
It is fulfilled, of course, as all other conditions, not always.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
These are also quite weak conditions.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
In fact, it is enough for the remains to be approximately normal.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
There is no need for a strict normality of the remains.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And, in fact, it is not so easy to check it all.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
The normality of the remains is the case.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So far, we have considered regression only for one variable.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Let's ask ourselves a question.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
What happens if we increase the number of variables?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
The answer is, oddly enough, what will happen to r²?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
r² is the indicator of the quality of our regression.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
The answer is, oddly enough, that r² cannot decrease.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Because the worst thing that regression can do with a new variable

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
is simply not to take it into account.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
That is, to set a coefficient of 0 and not to write it anywhere.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Most often, even if you add a completely useless variable,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
for example, call all your former classmates

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and find out their birthdays and their grandmothers.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
If you add this variable to regression,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
then your r² will increase, a little, but it will increase.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Why is this happening?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
As I have already explained, due to the nature of r².

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
r² cannot decrease, at least because,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
if you set a coefficient of 0 for a variable,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
regression will not decrease r².

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
What should we do when we add new variables?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.000
In any case, we should avoid introducing incomprehensible variables.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
For example, in some period, God forbid, in 1982,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Dow Jones, an indicator of the American market,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:40.000
correlated quite well with the average temperatures

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
in the city of Buffalo, New York.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Are the temperatures in the city of Buffalo, New York,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
variables that can be used to determine Dow Jones?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Of course not.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Otherwise, if you brought several powerful thermal power plants

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
to Buffalo, New York, you could influence Dow Jones.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Of course, there is no such influence.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Therefore, the temperatures in Buffalo, New York,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
if only you do not explain that in fact,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
there are dozens of trading offices in Buffalo, New York,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and if it is cold there, then traders simply do not get to work,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
if you do not come up with some logical explanation.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
The temperatures in Buffalo, New York, do not affect Dow Jones results.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
This is an incomprehensible variable.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Next. If you do what is called data mining,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
you will sooner or later find a variable

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
from which your dependent value depends.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Depends in quotation marks.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
As an example, a well-known risk manager

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
once published on a professional website

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
a message that he found a correlation between copper prices

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
and the number of spots in the sun.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
He said that the number of spots in the sun

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
predicts the price of copper.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Probably, this is also not very correct.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
What happened?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Most likely, he took the price of copper

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
and built a regression of these prices on 100 different variables.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
At the same time, if you have 100 data

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
and 100 different variables,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
sooner or later one of these 100 variables will come up

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and have a descriptive power,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
from the point of view of the researcher

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
who has gone through all these 100 variables,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
some kind of predictive power.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Then you will draw conclusions about the prices of copper

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
based on the prediction of your model,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
that is, based on the number of spots in the sun,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000
which is hardly such a good predictor.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And, of course, a very good start

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
for building a regression model

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
in the case of many variables

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
would probably be to think in advance

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
and determine what indicators we want to see

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
in order to describe our model.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
We will consider this in the example of body measurements,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:26.000
where we have a table of a person's weight,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
depending on his 10 measurements,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
such as height and some others.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
In this example, we use regression

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
as a function of two or even three variables.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:46.000
As I said, sometimes the remains have what is called autocorrelation.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
That is, our remains do not lie

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
randomly scattered relative to zero,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
the average of all remains is zero, of course,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
but they lie on some more or less smooth curve.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
In this case, you can get rid of the nonlinearity

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
by corresponding conversion.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
For example, we can introduce x2 as one of the variables,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
or maybe as the only variable.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And at the same time, although we say that this is linear regression,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
it will be linear regression, but linear regression on x2.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
This will allow you to get a coefficient

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
at the second degree of a certain variable.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Then an interesting thing arises

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
with the so-called qualitative indicators.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
We will consider this in more detail

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
using the example of Computer Store Sales.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
This is the example I was referring to

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
when I talked about the need to take into account

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
as much data as possible in statistics.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Or let's say,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
the need to take into account

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
a sufficiently large amount of data.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
We will now consider the example of Computer Store Sales,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
in which, as I said,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
it is not good to do regression on time,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
and as additional variables,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
we will have to introduce some special numbers of months,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:16.000
which will have a significant effect on sales.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I think no one will be surprised

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
if you think in advance and understand

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
that the sales of computer equipment

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
reach their maximum value in December,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
when there is time to make gifts

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and when our budgetary people finally receive the money

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
they have been promised for the whole year.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Here we have a table with measurements of various quantities,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
that is, the circumference of the forearm,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
biceps, chest, neck, shoulders, waist,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
height of a person,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
the circumference of the shins,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
the circumference of the thigh and the circumference of the head.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And the correlation of mass of all these quantities.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I think that just by looking at the data,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
we are ready to assume that the smallest correlation

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
will be between the mass and the circumference of the head.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Let's see.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Here in this table,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
the correlation, or rather, the result of the regression of the mass

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
is divided by all 10 variables that we have.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
They are located in this order.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
These first 5 are the upper part,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
and the second 5 are the lower part.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Accordingly, the circumference of the head is the last indicator.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
If you pay attention,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
first of all, the R-square is very low, 0.06.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:47.000
At the same time, if you try to divide the slope,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
that is, the slope, into the standard error in its definition,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000
you will see that this value does not exceed 2,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
and thus the circumference of the head itself

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
has no predictive force in determining the mass.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Okay, let's think now

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
what parameters we would like to see

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:19.000
to determine the mass of a person.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
As I said, imagine that you are the commander of a paratrooper platoon

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:31.000
and you need to load 4 tons of paratroopers into a helicopter or a plane.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000
You are limited in time, you are limited in dimensions,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
so probably the only parameter that paratroopers remember is height.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Perhaps they also remember the size of the uniform,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
the size of the uniform corresponds to the circumference of the chest,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
and apparently on their caps, or rather berets,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
you can see the size, the circumference of the head,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
but as we have already agreed,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
the circumference of the head does not play a statistically significant role,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
so we will not use the circumference of the head.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Thus, it is most convenient for us to use two variables,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
that is, the circumference of the chest,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
which is written as the size of the designer's uniform,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
and its height, which, as we believe, we remember.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Thus, the circumference of the chest,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
the table located here,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
it is made as follows.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Since XL can use only two columns next to each other as known X,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
then we have made a kind of squeeze table here,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
where the number is sorted from the left,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
then the mass is the second column,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
and as the third and fourth, that is, as the known X,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:12.000
various columns corresponding to the circumference of various parts of the body can be used.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Since we agreed to use the chest, this is the third column,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
and the height is the seventh column,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.000
we need to put number 7 and number 3 here.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Let's do the opposite, so that it is more understandable.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Number 3 and number 7.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:39.000
OK. Here in this cell, in this table, we have the results of the regression.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000
As I said, often the intercept, in this case, minus 150,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
has no physical meaning.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Well, it is quite difficult to imagine a person of zero height and zero chest circumference.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
To say that minus 150 is the weight of the soul is probably not very correct either.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Next, XL has such an unpleasant feature.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000
If here, if in the place where you use the variables as X,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
they are listed in the direct order,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
then in the answer they are listed in the reverse order.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
That is, this indicator corresponds to the chest circumference,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
and this one corresponds to the height.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000
So, we got R2 as 0.72.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
This is a fairly high R2,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
although, as you will be able to see in a while, it is not the highest.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
What else do we need to do?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:46.000
We need to check how good our results are.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I remind you that if the number obtained by separating the indicator

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
by the standard error of its definition by the module is greater than 2,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
then we believe that our regression is quite good.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
We got 2.8. This is actually very good.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
5.68 in this case and 3.74.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
That is, all the indicators we got are statistically significant.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Thus, how will we determine the weight of the soldier

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
who asks for a helicopter, a paratrooper?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:24.000
We will take the intercept, add to the intercept...

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Let's do it this way.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000
We will write the height and the chest circumference.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And here we will predict the weight.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Thus, the weight of the paratrooper is equal to minus 150 kg.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Plus, as I said, if here we have in this order, then here in the reverse order.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
We multiply this coefficient by the chest circumference.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And we multiply this coefficient by the height.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Thus, when the chest circumference is 104 cm and the height is 182 cm,

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
we expect that our paratrooper will weigh 81 kg.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
You can check these data.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
In fact, the predictions will be quite accurate.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Not perfect, but certainly accurate.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
For one simple reason.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
If you look closely,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
here we have data.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.000
The maximum weight is 94 kg and the minimum is 54.5 kg.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
If I see correctly.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Yes, the maximum is 94 kg, the minimum is 54.5 kg.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Of course, if your parameters go beyond the specified limits,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
then it will be quite difficult to predict your weight.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Nevertheless, if you measure your parameters,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
then your weight will be predicted with a fairly high accuracy.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Okay, let's move on.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
What else can we do?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
We can add another variable.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Pay attention.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Here we had r2, 0.72 approximately.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Using variables 5, 6 and 8

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
brings r2 to 0.94.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000
This is a very significant transformation.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
However, it should be noted that

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
variables 5, 6 and 8 are quite strange.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
This is the shoulder girth, the waist girth and the shin girth.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
The variables that should be used

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
would probably look like this.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
The height as an indicator of a person's linear size.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
The wrist girth as an indicator of the width of the bone.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
The ratio of the forearm girth to the wrist girth

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
as an indicator of a person's muscle mass.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And the shoulder width as an indicator of the body's weight.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
It's no secret that the weight of the skin

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
is a significant part of a person's weight.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
The weight of the skin is an indicator of this.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And the waist girth as an indicator of the total body weight.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Therefore, the indicators are very significantly dependent on the person's weight.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Okay, so by choosing these indicators,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
we get a significant increase in r2.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
In fact, we should look at the increase in r2

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
not as a literal increase,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
from 0.72 to 0.94,

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
but rather as a reduction of what is left.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
So, subtracting from 1.072, we get 0.28,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
and here we have 0.5.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So, from 0.28 we have reduced it to 0.5.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
This is a very significant reduction.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
This is a very significant increase in the accuracy of our forecast.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Well, let's do it this way.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Let's see how good our forecast is.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:15.000
We will divide all our indicators by their accuracy.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And, of course, all our indicators are good enough.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
It should be noted that when increasing the number of indicators,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.000
the overall significance of them will decrease slightly.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Because, let's say,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
each of them will have less and less impact.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
The determination of each indicator will be less and less accurate.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
That's all, by and large, on this issue.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
The only thing is that we will most likely return to this example

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
when we study the Monte Carlo generator.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
What are we going to do?

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
We will generate our paratroopers,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
or rather, first generate them one by one,

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
in order to create a platoon,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
in order to assess the probability that...

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
not the probability, let's say,

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
to determine the number of paratroopers that we can put in the helicopter

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
so that it does not overload.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Because nobody really wants to fall on a helicopter.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Okay, let's move on to the example of Computer Store Sales.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.000
As I said, my close friend Sergey,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
being in this month,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
that is, this is the 35th day in the month of its existence,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
did the following.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
He made a schedule for the previous 35 months.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
A schedule for the plant.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Let's use a slightly different diagram.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Let's use a connected diagram.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000
These two peaks, as it is difficult to guess, are December.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Sergey chose two of these peaks,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
connected them with a straight line,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
and assumed that its sales would be so great that it would not fit on the schedule.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
My slight objections, of course,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I wish him all the best in his business,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
but my slight objections are that, in general,

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
these could have been accidents,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
and the data for December 2

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.000
probably does not incorporate all possible data.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
But my objections, he said,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you understand something with your statistics,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I'll figure it out myself.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I predicted that its sales would be somewhere in this area.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Let's see what happens next.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Let's just increase our data series by one.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Even I was wrong.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Sales did not meet my forecast.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
What conclusion should be drawn from this?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
The conclusion should be simple.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Statistics are a necessary thing,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
it is stupid to fight it,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
it must be used.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So let's try to do it.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
What do we see when looking at this graph?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Yes, we have growth trends,

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
which is actually very nice.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
We have some failures, quite regular.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Subsequently, it will turn out that this failure corresponds to May.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
It is not very difficult to assume that in May,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
since everyone ends up there

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
and semesters and quarters,

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
those who study at school,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
apparently the demand from physical persons

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
on computer technology is significantly reduced.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
December, as already noted,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
demand is significantly increasing

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
as a gift to someone,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
to your loved one,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
and to someone else.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
In addition, in December,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
as a rule, money is received by budget organizations.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
This money must be used until the end of December.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Therefore, we will choose such variables.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Yes, besides everything else,

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
budget organizations are sometimes given money in the middle of the year.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
When will this happen?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
It is impossible to predict.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000
But to remove the post-factum,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
those months when the budget organizations were given money,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
would probably be right,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
in order not to calculate.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
After all, adding another variable,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
such as budget,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
will somewhat reduce our graph

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
in the points where the budget organizations were not given money,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
but increase it in the points where the budget organizations were given money.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And our graph will reflect reality more accurately.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Moreover, it will be more accurate to predict,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
but of course only those months where the budget organizations are not given money.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Since we cannot determine in advance

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
in which month the money will be given to the budget organizations.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Thus, we introduce the following variable.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000
This is what is called a qualitative variable,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000
or in English it is called a dummy variable,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000
or sometimes it is called a binary variable.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Binary, because they can take a value of either 0 or 1.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
We introduce the variable May,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
which is equal to 0 everywhere except for May.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
This is understandable.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
We cannot, for example,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
put a variable May equal to 1 in August.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000
A variable December, which is equal to 0 everywhere except for December.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And a variable month.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
As I said, it is not very good to do regression on time,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
but in this case we have nothing special left,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
so we will do it this way.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Here we used the function linear again.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
We write the function.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
These are the known y's.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Please note that I took the value not from the very beginning,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
but only since June of the first year of existence.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Why?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Because if you look at the graphs,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I will have to build it again.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
If you look at the graphs,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:58.000
you will find that the first few months of the store's existence are not very indicative.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And of course, who knows about it yet?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:07.000
After all, this plot is completely indicative.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Even if literally in 3-4 months everything has recovered more or less.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And in the first months, no one knew about the store.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Accordingly, the turnover of 100,000 rubles for a computer store is absolutely serious.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:30.000
That is why our data starts from the 6th month of existence.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
By that time, we already knew about the store.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
As variables, we use the variable month,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
the variable December, the variable May, the variable budget.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And 1.1 allows us to use the intercept

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and allows us to wait for Excel to give us the full statistics.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Let's interpret these data.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
What is 490,000?

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
490,000 would be the sales of this store

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.000
if it worked as a well-known store from the very beginning.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
That is, in the first month, not even in the first note,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
but in the first month, the sales of this store would be 490,000.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
In the first month, that is, in January of the corresponding year,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.000
the sales of the store would be 490,000 plus 1 times the coefficient for the variable month.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Further.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
This coefficient means that on average we have the right to expect

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:38.000
that the sales of our store will increase by about 9,000 rubles, 8,937 rubles per month.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
If only this month is not May, December or the month in which the budgeters were given money.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.000
May brings us an average negative usefulness of minus 236,000.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.000
December adds about 805,000 to our sales.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000
And the month in which the budgeters were given money adds about 274,000 rubles to our sales.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.000
If we check our months for statistical significance,

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
all of them are statistically significant.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Let's try to do the following.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Let's try to build a graph.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:41.000
We take the month, take the total sales and build a graph.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
We have already seen such a graph.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:55.000
As I said, my friend connected these two points and got a forecast that was significantly beyond the limits of the graph.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:01.000
We looked at regression in more detail.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Now we can compare the forecast that our regression gives with the actual sales results.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Thus, we added a red graph to our blue graph.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:32.000
If you pay attention, the graph accurately tracks almost all fluctuations in the graph of the actual sales,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
with some exceptions, of course.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:49.000
If you look at the difference in the graph between the last time and the remaining time,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
the graph has been predicting the sales for the last time.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:00.000
This is good, because it means that in some time our sales will be higher than the expected numbers.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:09.000
As I said, this week I spoke to Sergey.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Now he is convinced that there is a dependence.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:32.000
As you can see, his 49th month was predicted to be about 500 rubles.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:40.000
This accuracy surprised him, and since then he has been addressing this statistic quite regularly.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:56.000
We will talk in more detail about the quality of forecasts in the example of another regression.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:07.000
This will be a regression of the results of 10 sportsmen in 10 storms on their results in different types.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:18.000
This table shows the results of more than 50 different sportsmen.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
You can't say that these are 50 different sportsmen.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
If you pay attention, for example, Dan O'Brien is a well-known 10th-storm player.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
He has been here several times.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Perhaps we can ask a question about the regression results for the country.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Apparently, the regression results will be mixed.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Or, let's say, we can introduce variables USA, not USA, because Dan O'Brien dominated in the USA at that time.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:53.000
What can be said in advance, without looking at the regression results,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
in relation to the coefficients that will be at the corresponding variables?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It is obvious that the highest coefficient will be at the height jump,

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000
because there are relatively small results.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Nobody jumps from 10 meters to 2 meters.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
The second coefficient should be at the jump with 6 meters,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
because this is the second result.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Next, the jump to the length of 100 meters, 100 meters with barriers, and so on.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Here it should be said that the result at 100 meters will be negative,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
because the coefficient at 100 meters will be negative,

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.000
because 10th-storm players are not awarded points for running slowly at 100 meters.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000
They are not awarded points because they run fast at 100 meters.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Here in the table there are the results of the regression of the 10th-storm players.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
The results are in each separate form.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Let's try to interpret.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Intercept 850.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Quite a lot, you might say, for a person who jumped to the length of 0 centimeters,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
pushed the core to 0 centimeters, jumped to the height of 0 centimeters, and so on.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
But don't forget that this person ran 100 meters in 0 seconds,

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
400 meters in 0 seconds, and even 1500 meters in 0 seconds.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Of course, in this case, the intercept has no physical sense.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:36.000
But as we said, the highest coefficient is at the height jump,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:44.000
the lowest coefficient is at the height jump,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
the lowest coefficient is at the height jump,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
the lowest coefficient is at the height jump,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
and so on.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
As we said, all running types will have negative coefficients,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.000
all throwing types and all jumping types will have positive coefficients.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I remind you that Excel gives us the results of the pivot-to-pivot,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
so that we don't confuse them,

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
here they are given in the same order.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Let's look at the results shown by Roman Sebrele.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Let's take his data and put it in the prediction table.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
The result is 9027 points.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Now let's look at the result obtained by the judges

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.000
when calculating his final score in the test.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.000
In the case of our body measurements,

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
where we measured the dependence of a person's weight,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
a person's mass on various indicators,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:06.000
we were convinced that adding extra variables to the regression increases the R-square.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:12.000
However, it should be remembered that you should not get involved in the game of adding extra variables.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:22.000
In any case, your model should be as more...

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I would even use the word scarid, as more poor as possible.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Okay, let it be so.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000
The fact is that when you increase the number of variables,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
you, in a sense, deprive your model of predictive power.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Therefore, the fewer such variables, the better.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000
If, of course, you are not absolutely convinced that your model

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:55.000
clearly corresponds to the incoming variables with the result.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:01.000
If, let's say, you do not measure anything mechanical,

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
in the full sense of the word,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000
not such as some public indicators

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.000
and not such strange things as the mass of a person's body.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Okay, using the example of the sale of a computer store,

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
we looked at the use of the so-called binary variables.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
That is, variables that take a value equal to zero everywhere,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
except for certain points where they take a value equal to one.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Here we need to make a small remark.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.000
How many binary variables do we really need?

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Let's imagine that we make binary variables,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
or these very dummy variables,

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
which are the same, by the number of months.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Do we need 12 of them?

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
In fact, no.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
In fact, no, because you have to leave something for a year.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
That is, one variable takes a year in its entirety,

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
and the remaining 11 you distribute between months.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:11.000
If you enter 12, then most often the regression equals its zero,

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000
simply because the 12th variable will be simply superfluous.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Nevertheless, the introduction of such binary variables

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:29.000
helps us assess the presence of one or another event.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
The event can be anything,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:38.000
such as December, the color of the car, the quality of gasoline, and so on.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000
How much does this event affect the results of our regression.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:51.000
In the example of September, we looked at the dependence of the result

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
on a large number of variables.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Indeed, a very large number of variables.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:05.000
In fact, it would be great if you could build a regression,

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000
or, let's say, a prediction of the results in September,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
using fewer variables.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:18.000
It would probably be logical to use such variables as the result in jumps in 6th,

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
this will be a technical indicator,

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
since it requires very complex coordination,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
the result in the core push as an indicator of strength,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
and the result in a 100-meter run as an indicator of speed.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Probably, these three results will be enough

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
to accurately determine the total result of a person in a 10-bore.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Of course, if you find some more complete or more correct explanations,

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
you can use them.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
It would even be interesting if you could

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
sort out as many combinations as possible as a prediction.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
One thing can be said for sure,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
the result in a 10-bore does not affect the result in 1500 meters,

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
because it is not a favorite view of all 10-bores.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
In addition, in the computer store sales,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
we can predict profits.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:19.000
However, it is much more difficult to predict profits using regression.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:25.000
The fact is that some of the store costs are conditional constants,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
some are conditional variables.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Therefore, it is more correct to do the following.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000
We can predict the costs separately.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:41.000
It is quite likely that the store costs may depend on the time of A and the season B.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
For example, heating costs are obviously much higher in the winter than in the summer.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Although, of course, since we are talking about Volgograd,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
there are costs for air conditioning.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And by subtracting the expense forecast from the sales forecast,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
we get the store profit forecast.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
This forecast is much more accurate than the profit forecast,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:12.000
because the profit itself is more volatile than sales and, of course, expenses.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
As for the quality of our results in 10-bore,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
if you pay attention,

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:26.000
our last action was a test result of Roman Sebrly,

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
a famous Czech 10-bore.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
We got 9027 points.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
This is according to our forecast.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Its actual result was 9026 points.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:43.000
The difference in one point is literally a little more than 0.1%.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
If you substitute the next result, which belongs to Estonia, to Ola,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
you will find an even smaller difference.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
If you do not find it, then check the results.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
The fact is that there could be a print.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Nevertheless, our table gives very high accuracy.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
True, with one small caveat.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Within the limits where we have a real measurement of the results.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.000
If you try to substitute your result, or, God forbid, mine,

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
the difference will be very significant.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
That is why we have results of only top athletes.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Unfortunately, we did not get the results of low-level athletes.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.000
It makes sense to talk a little about how accurate the forecasts can be.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Of course, the forecast is a relatively useless thing.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Useless in the sense that, as you know, a person assumes, and God arranges.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
You want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
All this is clear.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Indeed, it often happens that a person makes a forecast,

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000
and then it turns out that he did not take into account some very important event.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:10.000
It can be a catastrophic event, such as September 11, 2001, or something similar.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
It is impossible to take into account such an event.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
There is no way.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Until it happened, we do not know that it is feasible.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
We can know hypothetically, but we have never observed this event.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:31.000
The fact that we did not observe it, as I said before, does not mean that it is physically impossible.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Therefore, people generally do not predict well.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:43.000
But regression, the use of regression, allows us to improve our forecasts a little.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:51.000
The truth is, in the definitions of the author of the book Black Swan, Nassim Nikolai Staleb,

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000
our ability to predict refers to what he calls a mediocre stand.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
That is, directly to the stand, unlike the extreme stand.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Extreme stand, I think, does not require translation.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000
What else is there to say here?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000
If we continue to consider our case with the December,

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
we have a very high R-square, 0.98.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Of course, if we reduce the number of variables, the R-square will decrease.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:30.000
But the predictive power will not decrease as quickly as the R-square will decrease.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:38.000
In addition, if we reduce the number of variables,

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000
it will be easier to describe the results.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:50.000
What we call an in-sample versus an out-of-sample.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:57.000
That is, the results that are in our selection versus those that do not fall into our selection.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000
We can consider another example of regression.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Imagine such a hypothetical task.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Each plant produces pieces of junk and metal.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Each of these pieces of junk and metal uses a different amount of the same material.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
But if you can somehow still check the material,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:37.000
then it is much more difficult for you to check electricity or use of warm water.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Then what can you do?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
What is the option?

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
In fact, the only option that remains for you.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:49.000
You monitor the release of pieces of junk and metal for, say, three years.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000
And you build a regression of the amount of water spent,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000
depending on the number of pieces of junk and metal released.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000
The coefficients of this regression will be approximately,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
no one says that they will be accurate,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
the results of your costs.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000
If you spend one cubic meter of water on one piece of junk,

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
if the coefficient for one piece of junk is one cubic meter,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
then, accordingly, one cubic meter of water is spent to make one piece of junk.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
On one piece of metal, and so on.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
This is a good way, we will now consider it with you.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
As we said, your plant produces pieces of junk and metal.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
And you want to determine the consumption of hot water

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
in the production of your production.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.000
You have data for a certain number of months,

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
let it not bother you that this is a month.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
In this case, we do not use regression for time,

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:54.000
we will use regression only for the number of produced products.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Although, of course, we assume that

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
during this time we have not had significant changes

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.000
both in our plant and in the environment.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I remind you that in order to make a regression,

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
we will use the function Linean.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Once again, its format is known y,

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
in this case, this is the consumption of hot water.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Regression to known x,

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I remind you again, we do not use the number of months.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.000
And we will always have 1 and 1 here.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:44.000
The first unit means the need to include constants,

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
the intercept of the same.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
The second unit means the need to output statistics.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I remind you again, we now select a rectangle

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
with a height of 5 lines and a width of n plus 1 columns,

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
where n is the number of variables,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
in this case, the number of variables is 3,

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
so we select a rectangle with a height of 5 lines and 4 columns.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
And we press the F2 key first,

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
and then simultaneously CTRL, SHIFT and ENTER.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Okay, let's see our tests,

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
how fair our statistics is.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.000
We will now divide the corresponding quantities

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.000
by the standard error in their definition.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000
In fact, it is clear that the intercept is not accurately defined,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.000
so we will have to say that intercept A is zero.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Although, in this case, the intercept has a certain physical meaning,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
for example, this is the amount of hot water

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
that office workers spend,

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000
that is, workers who are not involved in the production of junk,

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
junk and hardware.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000
As you can see, each of the quantities,

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
both the junk that corresponds to this column,

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
and the junk and hardware,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.000
each of them is statistically significant in terms of their quantity,

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.000
and we can say with confidence

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
that the production of each type of product

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
significantly affects the consumption of hot water.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
We have a very high R2, as you can see.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Accordingly, what do these data mean?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
These data mean that

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
sorry, these data.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
These data mean that for the production of one thing,

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
we spend an average of 3.4,

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
let's say cubic meters of hot water,

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000
for the production of one junk, about 5.13,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
and for the production of one hardware, about 2.59.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.000
We can put these results into the cost calculation

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
in order to more accurately determine

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.000
how much money we spend on the production of one type of product.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
In this case, the numbers are comparable,

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000
but if, for example, one of them had a surge,

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
a surge of 25 or 50,

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.000
and we automatically thought that hot water was spent

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000
in proportion to sales,

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.000
it would be completely unfair to the remaining participants in the process.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
This method allows us to better determine the cost,

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.000
for example, allows us to better understand where we are.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Okay, I see that you have thought enough, you are tired enough.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Periodically, during the course, I will give you small tasks.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Students of the department I assign these tasks to

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
are treated differently.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Sometimes they are called shaking dust from the ears,

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000
sometimes they are called straining the brain muscle, and so on.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
These tasks are relatively simple,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:15.000
and can be solved by a person with 6-7-8 classes of education.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000
But they are not simple at first glance.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:25.000
In fact, a large number of answers that you will give to these tasks will be incorrect.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
You just need to get used to it,

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
you just need to think about each task for a long time.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
And if you can think about this task,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000
then, first of all, it will be useful for you to think about it.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Secondly, you will learn to, let's say,

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.000
to sweep away those solutions that will seem obvious to you

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
only on the basis that this is your impression,

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
not a solution, in fact.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Okay, the first task.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
A boat is sailing in the pool.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
At the bottom of the boat is a 32-kilogram cast-iron gel.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
And the person who is sitting in the boat

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000
throws the gel from the boat into the pool, that is, into the water.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
How, at the same time, does the water level in the pool change?

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Does it decrease, remain constant, or increase?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
There are only three options.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Most often, these tasks will have several options for the answer.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Not all of them will be with an open answer, as it is called.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
You have to choose one of the three options.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
That's it.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Next task.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Imagine ordinary lever scales,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
pharmacy scales with two cups.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
There is a glass of water on one cup,

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
and a kettle on the other cup.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
You dip your finger in the glass of water.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Well, since the finger is yours,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
you do not separate it from the rest of the brush.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.000
That is, you continue to hold your finger with your brush.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Will the balance of the scales change?

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
And if it changes, how?

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Will the glass weigh over,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
will the kettle weigh over,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
or will the balance of the scales not change?

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Think about it.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000
After a while, at the end of the lecture, the answer will be announced.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
So, we talked with you about statistics.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
We studied some statistical models.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Most of all, of course, we talked about regression.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Now we see how convenient regression can be,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
