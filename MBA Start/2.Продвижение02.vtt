WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
This way, we can increase the turnover from 80% to 300%

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
But before we move on to the rules, I would like to focus on the goals

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Because goals are the first thing we define

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
I would like to focus on the goals of the merchandiser and the salesperson

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that these are different goals

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
And you should consider the goals of the salesperson when you come to her and offer your standard

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
You should understand what they want

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Let's look at the goals of the manufacturer

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Increasing the turnover and volume of sales of your own product

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
If you pay attention to the salesperson's goals, you will see that the salesperson's turnover is increasing

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
It doesn't matter if your product is increasing or someone else's

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
The main thing is that the turnover of the store becomes larger

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
The next goal of the manufacturer is to draw attention to its own assortment, to its own trademark

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
And this is understandable because our goal is to promote our trademark to the market

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And what does the salesperson tell us?

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
The salesperson says that it is important for him to optimize the assortment of the store as a whole

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Because the store provides a service for selecting an assortment

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
And not the only product that the buyer needs to present

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
The main thing is that the buyer came and found everything he needs in this trading point

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Therefore, he will not pay special attention to your product

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
The next goal of the manufacturer is to create a competitive advantage of the product

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And what do we see from the seller?

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Of course, the creation of a competitive advantage of the store

01:49.000 --> 02:00.000
For example, there is a wider assortment, lower prices, convenient parking, or a complex with a store, cafe and entertainment center

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
That is, the seller cares about the competitive advantage of the store as a whole

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
It is a competitive advantage of our product

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Our goals do not converge here

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
The next point is to create an attachment to the trademark, the manufacturer tells us

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
What does the seller say?

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
He just needs an optimal assortment of well-known brands that will attract certain buyers

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
He does not care about the attachment to a particular brand

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
He cares about the attachment to a package of well-known brands

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
The next goal of the manufacturer is, of course, to avoid a situation when the product is absent in the trading point

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
This is a very important point

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Because when your product is not there, the buyer just switches to another trading brand

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
For the store, of course, it is also important that the full assortment is present

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
But if there is no your product, they will put another one

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
In general, there will be no problems

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Therefore, here you yourself must make sure that your product is present in the trading point

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
And the next goal is to create an attachment to the positive image of the manufacturer

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
The manufacturer says, it is important for me to be well perceived

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And what does the store say?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
The store says that it is important for him to be perceived in general

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
The store is good, positive

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
To have flexible conditions there, for example, in terms of working time

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
For example, until the last buyer

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Or something like that

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
That is, the store is important, of course, everything in general

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
And our trading brand is important to us

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
And these things need to be taken into account when we develop the standard of merchandising

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
And we offer our products to the trading point

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Let's consider the main tasks of the merchandising company

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
What should you pay attention to when you develop the standard

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Or when you determine the product schedule

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
What you must take into account

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
The first is the minimum set of assortment positions

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Or they also call it SKU

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Roughly speaking, one unit of the assortment

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
That is, how many of you should have the layout of this assortment

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
So that your layout looks high quality and good

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
The next task is the place where your product is placed

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
You must determine the category in which department your product is placed

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And in what place of the store

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
The next task is the number of additional sales places

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
This is very important, because additional sales places

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Give the opportunity for additional acquaintance with your product

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
And, of course, there is your most popular product

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Which greatly increases the turnover

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
You must determine in advance where it is possible to place additional places

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Next, you must determine the number of SKU

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
How many assortment units of the product are set

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And the order of their placement

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
For example, from light to dark, from the lowest price to the highest

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
From the lowest fat to the highest, and so on

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
That is, the order can be different depending on the product

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Depending on the colors, if the product is set from light to dark

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Or the combination of colors, or joint purchase

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
That is, the rules can be different, there are a lot of them

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
But nevertheless, you must immediately determine in the standard

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
According to what rules you place this product

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
The next point is the number of positions, or they also call it facing

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Look, the assortment is an assortment unit

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
For example, you decided that you will put three office chairs

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
But these three office chairs can be repeated, right?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And there will be three SKU, because there are three different types

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
And facing is how many chairs there will be

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Roughly speaking, if you put each SKU in two positions

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Then the facing will be equal to six

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
The next thing to determine is the stock or the minimum load

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
The stock must be such that it is constantly present on the shelf of the store

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
And your product, even taking into account that it leaves this shelf

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
That is, a certain stock must always be in the storehouse of the seller

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
The next point is positioning the price relative to the competitors

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
That is, you must immediately determine in what price category your product is located

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Because different price categories are distributed differently

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
And actually, where this product will be located, next to which competitors

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
And what is the recommended price of your product

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Because we know that each store gives its own rating, it is different

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Therefore, we must clearly determine what the rating will be

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
The next point that is often determined by very famous manufacturers

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
This is the share relative to the competitors of your product

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
For example, you say that the share of our office chairs must be 50% relative to competitors

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That is, half of the categories should be occupied by us

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
This is, of course, an ambitious goal, but nevertheless, such goals are set

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
In order to ensure their recognition

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And two more points that we must talk about

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
This is, of course, the placement of the price tags

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
A clear and competent design is necessary and where they are placed

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
In some stores there are price tag standards, this is great

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
But in some stores they are simply not observed

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Therefore, where and how we place them must be necessarily agreed upon in the standard of merchandising

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
And the last point is the schedule itself

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
That is, we must draw out how, where and why our product is in what order

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
So that the merchandising does not invent, compose and fantasize

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
How to put it, how it will be better, how worse

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
We must give him a clear instruction so that he does not touch it

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
Only this will ensure you increased sales and efficiency of this tool

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
All the basic rules of merchandising will be described in your lecture material

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Which will help you to correctly form a schedule and a standard of merchandising

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
These rules are divided into three groups

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
This is the location, presentation and stock

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
You can decode all of them there, look at the rules of the layout

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
And, in fact, create your own merchandising standard

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
And about the location itself, I would like to say a few more words

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
And show you the hot and cold zones in the store

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
To understand where you can put your product and where not

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Here is an image on the slide

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
And there you see that all 100% that enter the store

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Only 90% of them are in the first square

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
The other 10% take what is needed and go to the checkout

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Or return, leaving the store

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Then, along the way, only 70% pass

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
The other 20% have already taken the product and gone to the checkout

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Only 50% pass further

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And at the end of the store, that is, the entire cycle of the store only 30% passes

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
You see how the number of buyers who pass the whole hall decreases

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
This naturally reduces the efficiency of sales

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
And that square where the buyer is only 30%

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
This is the bottom left square

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
It is considered the most ineffective

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It is considered the cold zone of the store

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
If your product is located in this zone, do not be surprised

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Why are your sales so small

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
How to avoid this

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
You can highlight something bright

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You can put large figures

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Additional lighting

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Any bright things that attract the attention of the buyer

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And will make them go further

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Remember the location of the supermarkets

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
In this department, most often, there is bread

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And not only is it baked there

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
The smell of bread makes us go there

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Like Pavlov's dog, this smell

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Makes us go through most of the store

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
That is why departments are placed in this way

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Also on the slide you have the rules of the golden triangle

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
The location of the golden triangle consists of three parts

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
The first is the entrance

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
The second point is the checkout

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And the third point is the departments that are visited most often

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
By the buyer

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Milk, meat

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
That is, daily products are sold there

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
For which the buyer came for sure

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
And your task as a manufacturer

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
If you are a manufacturer, to get into the zone of this golden triangle

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Because when you get into the zone of the golden triangle

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Your sales increase by at least 80%

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
There, most often, the buyers pass

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
And the task of the store itself is to expand this zone

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
That is, to distribute the most popular departments, checkout and entrance by distance

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Thus, expanding the field of active activity of buyers

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And the zone of active purchases

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, we move on to stimulating end consumers

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Not all companies are engaged in stimulating end consumers

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
Nevertheless, yes, it is an expensive process, but very necessary

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Because the client can leave us to other intermediaries

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
If he is not satisfied with our discount

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And end consumers are more loyal

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
If they liked our products

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
They will definitely come back to us

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
Buying from us and providing us with this or that income

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
So, when we stimulate end consumers

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
The main goal is, of course, to increase the volume of sales

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
But you can increase the volume of sales in several ways

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
And you have it shown on the diagram

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
At least, the increase in sales is divided into two parts

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
To ensure loyalty and trial purchases

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Trial purchases are, of course, more related to the new product

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And loyalty is already related to the existing product

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
To maintain the recognition and loyalty of our product

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
These two groups are divided into goals

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Additionally, trial purchases are divided into two parts

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Pre-ordering of the product, that is, the person should want to buy it

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
And availability, he should find a place where it is sold

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
And loyalty is divided into three parts

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Frequency of purchase, how often do they buy

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Adherence, do they buy our brand all the time

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
And the possibility or frequency of switching from the brand of competitors to our brand

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
All these five goals are laid out further

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
You can see it in the lecture material

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
There is a detailed description of each of the possible goals

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
When setting and developing the stimulation program for end consumers

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
We will see how to properly plan these actions

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Planning consists of three main steps

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
The first is to determine the target audience

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
We must understand who we are targeting our program for

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Who are its participants

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
There are several criteria that help the target audience to determine the end consumers

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Three main groups are regional criteria

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
The lifestyle of consumers

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And the third group is demographic criteria

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
I will tell you that demographic criteria are most often used

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
Age, gender, education level

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
The second place is regional criteria, location, climate

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
It is very important for some products

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
And the third place is the criteria of the lifestyle of consumers

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
These criteria are more sociological, that's why they are used less often

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
To determine your target audience by these criteria

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
You need specialists, sociologists or psychologists

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
That's why they are used less often

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
When we determined the target audience, we described it

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
For example, our target audience of vitamins

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Polyvitamins

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
These are women between 25 and 45 years old

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
With a family, at least one child

14:15.000 --> 14:26.000
Working, with a higher or lower education

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
Living in cities with a population of at least 200,000 people

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Here is a segmentation of vitamins consumption

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Of course, all other categories, women or men, can also consume vitamins

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
But we, remember, select the target audience

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
That is, the one that buys the most

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Here we have determined it

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
The clearer your segmentation, the more competently you will develop the promotion program

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
Remember, skeletons are yogurts that were aimed at a group of teenagers between 12 and 14 years old

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
The positioning was very clear

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
It was this that gave such success to this product

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Yes, parents didn't like this product because there were skeletons drawn

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It was ridiculous and funny

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Or maybe it was unpleasant for someone

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
But skeletons achieved their target audience

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
And their sales were amazing

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
Therefore, the target audience is a determining factor of success

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
The second step is the time of holding

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
We determine how long the promotion will last

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
It can be a long-term promotion

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
It can be held during the season

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Or regular events, or periodic

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
What is it about?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Or some festive events

15:53.000 --> 16:01.000
And we determine whether it is short-term, medium-term, and long-term

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It can be more than 3 months and up to a year

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
Although I will say that short-term events are more effective than long-term

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Why?

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
When we hold a promotion program in a short period

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
The effect comes quickly

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Sales rise quickly

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
And we see the result right away

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Because we make our customers act immediately

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
The duration of the action is limited by the program

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
And when the program is long-term, there is such a postponement effect

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
The program is still going on for a long time

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
I will come later, I will do it later, I will buy it later

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
While I have this, while I have that

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
As a result, your promotion works worse

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It has no peak

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
It rises a little and goes to this level

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
And you get the feeling that you spend a lot, but you have no effect

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
Therefore, short-term promotions work more effectively

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
And work more purposefully for end consumers

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
Well, the third point that we must determine is budget restrictions

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
The budget is offered in different ways

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It is developed in different ways

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Here are the main methods of budget formation

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
The first is the percentage of sales

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
When we say that we have a sales volume and such a percentage, for example, 3 or 5 percent

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
We can take it for a promotion program

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Yes, this is an option, because it depends on the turnover, it is tied clearly

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
And we will not spend more than necessary

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
The second option is possible, it is from the profit

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
The owner says, wow, you can take from the turnover

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
And you take from the additional turnover, how much you earn additionally, or rather from the profit

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
This is also a correct option, because it is important for the owner how much additional money he will receive

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
And not just stimulate his end consumers

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
The next point is planning for goals

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
When you set goals, determine the share that you need

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And then you form a budget

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
And then you approve this budget

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Planning for goals is the most competent option for planning

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
But, of course, you need to calculate and not go into losses

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
If we planned for goals that we need to spend certain amounts

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
It does not mean that the company should work in losses

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
The marketer should count both sides of the coin

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Both sides of the spending and sides of the income

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
Otherwise, the share will not be effective, and therefore it will not be a stimulus share

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
The next two points that can be taken into account

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Comparing with the industry costs

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
You know how much is spent on advertising

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
For example, on advertising of washing powder, the company spends 2 million dollars every year

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
And you, based on this, understand that if you spend 1.5 million

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
There will be no such effect

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
If you spend 2.5 million, there will be more effect

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
But 2.5 million is an average amount that you need to make to ensure such fame

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
The average spending on advertising is compared

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
There are sources of information, for example, the journal Praktika Reklamy

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
It is constantly published there

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
The next point that can be taken into account is the comparison with competitors

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Look what competitors do

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
We know how much advertising costs in the media

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
How much it costs to hold a certain promotion

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
How much it costs to promote

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
How much it costs to make a video, etc.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
We know all these estimates

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Looking at what competitors do, you can safely calculate how much they spend

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
And if you position yourself next to them

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
You can determine such an amount or a little more

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Depending on what goals you have for advertising

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
There is also one method, the most ineffective, for residual funds

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Roughly speaking, how much money is left is yours

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Usually, there is no money left

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
That's why such a method is the most ineffective and does not usually give results

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in your lecture material

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Rules and techniques for creating ideas will be voiced and outlined

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
The most basic rules that are used in one way or another when developing various promotions

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
These are the magic numbers when we say

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
All goods for 10 rubles or two for the price of one, etc.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
The next is crisis sales

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Remember the company Zhe, the store Zhe that says sales

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Sales have been going on for two or three years

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And how could it not be sold

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
You announce this and all customers come to you because they think you are closing

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Next, a gift for purchase

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
This is another idea that is very often used and used

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Because everyone likes to receive gifts

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
What else would I like to draw your attention to?

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
When you think about the idea of ​​a promotion, pay attention to the topics that are interesting to everyone

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
What topics are interesting to everyone?

20:58.000 --> 21:09.000
Cars, sports, war, sex, children, animals, entertainment, food

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Everything that concerns our life, everything that guides us one way or another

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
You can take all these topics as an idea for a promotion

21:17.000 --> 21:25.000
Because everything that concerns our life, everything that passes through feelings, through emotions works very well

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
You can apply various ambivalence or gossips

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
For example, a discount is equal to the number of years

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
Or today there will be such a discount as today, for example, the number in the yard

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
The only thing is that everyone will wait until the end of the month because the discount will be higher

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Next, you can apply elements of the corporate style

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
In my video, the company did such a promotion

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Everyone who comes in red will get a 10% discount

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Next, you can develop the existing concept

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
For example, you already have a discount card

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But you continue to work with it and say

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Everyone who comes with a discount card today will get a double discount

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Not the one that is indicated on the card

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
And, in fact, new well-taken care of the old

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Again, recommendations, make a database and look at them

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
What actions work best for you

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I would like to offer you another method

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
This is an assessment of the creative idea of ​​the action

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
There are the main criteria by which you can recheck yourself

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Did you take everything into account?

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
Did you work out all the criteria when you thought out the idea of ​​your action?

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
It is evaluated on a 10-point scale and, in fact, the final score is then deduced

22:35.000 --> 22:44.000
The final score is not as important as the criteria that earn the lowest scores in your assessment

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
This means that they are not worked out and you need to do something with them

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
This is a signal that the action is not fully thought out

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
What criteria are there?

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Of course, the compliance of the trademark

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
We look at how much your idea complies with the trademark

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
If your product is exclusive and very expensive, then you should not start a sale

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Uniqueness, unique ideas

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
It's great when you have a high score on this point

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
But most often, ideas are repeated

23:16.000 --> 23:22.000
However, if you have something interesting, like an office test drive chair

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
This idea deserves a very high score

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Try to come up with something of your own

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Or give the agency the opportunity to do it

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
The next criterion is the ability to implement it in practice

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Because you can come up with anything, for example, a flight to the moon

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
But how much can it be implemented is a question

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Therefore, the idea must be realistic

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
The relevance of the idea

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Fashion for certain things

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
It is desirable to follow fashion

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
For example, mobile marketing is very relevant now

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
You can hold promotions on your mobile phone, which work very well

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Or with the introduction of new technologies

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Effectiveness

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Your offer should be interesting to buyers

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
It should satisfy their needs

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Because if they are interested in it, they will not participate in any promotion

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
The next two criteria are simplicity and availability

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Simplicity is how clear the conditions are

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So that you don't have this

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Go to the forest, look for the tenth stump

24:24.000 --> 24:31.000
Find a coupon, bring it to the fourth store after the fifth turn, and so on

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
The more complicated the conditions of the promotion, the more likely it is that no one will participate in your promotion

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
And availability

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
How easy it is to participate in your promotion

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
So that it was a trading point nearby

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
So that a person could come and find where the promotion takes place, where they give prizes, and so on

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
The next criteria is visibility for the target audience

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
It is visible and it is good when it coincides with the already held advertising campaigns

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It is within the general concept

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Not just one promotion, but within the general concept

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Then its effectiveness increases many times

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
The next points

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
The idea should be in line with all elements of marketing

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And be attractive to the target audience

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
You should also evaluate on a ten-point scale

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
And the reward for the participants is attractive and useful

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
They need this product

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
It's not just some kind of trifle that a person will throw out on the street

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
This way, using this method, you can evaluate your idea

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
And see what points you still need to work on

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
What should you pay attention to when developing a promotional campaign?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Of course, the development of a scenario

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
This is the main document that will allow you to hold a promotional campaign without a hitch

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
That is, not to forget anything that is particularly important

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
So that the campaign takes place and is effective

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
There are six main sections of a promotional campaign

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
The first is, of course, a detailed description of the mechanics

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
What do you want to get from this promotion?

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
How should this promotion go?

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
What should your buyer do to get a prize?

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
What is the prize? Where will it be issued?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
In what quantity?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
All this must be written down

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
All the conditions of the promotion

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
This is probably the most important thing to do in the first place

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Because the budget of your promotion will depend on it

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
The next thing to do is to choose a place to hold the promotion

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
That is, where do you hold it?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
How many trading points?

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
If it's in trading points or somewhere else

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
It is important to choose a place to hold the promotion

26:44.000 --> 26:54.000
And decide whether to agree to hold this promotion at the period that you are interested in

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
The next main point to consider is working with the promo staff

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
You need to take this moment especially seriously

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Because the result of your promotion depends on the promo staff

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
If you give it all to the agency for a bribe

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
And do not take part in this

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
You risk that your promo staff will not be ready for the promotion

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Will not understand what kind of product it is

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
What is the purpose of the promotion

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And most importantly, what should be achieved

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
As a result, the money spent will simply go nowhere

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
Therefore, be sure to participate in the selection of promo staff and in its preparation

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
This is a key point

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
The next step is preparation for the event

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
You have scheduled it, you have recruited everyone

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Now you need to check if everything is ready

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Do the sales managers know that the product needs to be delivered?

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Do the trading points know that they are holding a promotion?

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Does the promo staff know everything?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Are there enough prizes?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Are they brought to the trading points?

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
All these points must be checked and calculated

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And once again, I remind everyone

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
That at some point the promotion starts

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
So that everyone is ready

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
The next step is the event itself

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Here I have one recommendation for you

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Strict control

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
In Russia, the order to become a management is a reason for reflection

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Therefore, always check if everything goes well

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
If there is no control, I assure you

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
Mistakes and failures will be more than enough

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Because even when there is control, this happens

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
But there you can at least react quickly

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
If you don't control, the results of the promotion will be depressing

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
And you won't be able to fix anything

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
Therefore, always control and correct the situation during the promotion

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Keep your fingers crossed

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
The next step is the action after the promotion

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That is, the analysis of efficiency

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Here you must calculate

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Did you spend money in vain?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Did you do everything that was necessary?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
What were the miscalculations or problems?

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
In the lecture material, you will have an example of the promotion report

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
That you can use in your work

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
What mistakes are most often made during promotions?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I counted 17 of them

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Maybe you will add something to my list?

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
What happened, it happened from practice

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
The first mistake is the lack of planning

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
When a sales manager comes to us and says

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
Urgently, I am being taken out of the store, let's do some promotion faster

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
That is, it was necessary to do everything yesterday

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
There is a hurry

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
We start to do something without planning

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
This is a strategy of picking up the holes, which we have already talked about today

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
And as a result, the promotion turns out so-so

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
That is, something, of course, comes out

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
With the efforts of managers, with the time and resources

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
But it could have turned out much better if everything was according to plan

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
Therefore, do not take literally the words of managers

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Work according to your plan

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Only then will there be order

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
The next point is poor staff preparation

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
This is what I was talking about

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
They did not control the information of the staff

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
That is, not everyone knows about the promotion, who needs to know

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
And moreover, the prom staff cannot link two words about your product

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Which is completely unacceptable

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Theft

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
In general, theft is probably the common problem in Russia

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I do not know

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Promoters, of course, even exchange prizes

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
Sometimes when several promotions take place in the trading point, they begin to exchange prizes

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
This is not a hobby

30:33.000 --> 30:39.000
Naturally, you cannot prevent 100% theft of your souvenirs, prizes, gifts, and so on

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
But by giving a decent payment to the promoter

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
And putting the case under clear control

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That is, registration of all, giving out all gifts

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
You at least reduce this percentage

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
I do not enjoy illusions that you can completely eliminate this problem

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
But at least reduce losses

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
This is also useful

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
The next is the appearance of promoters

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
What usually happens

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
Usually t-shirts, caps, corporate color

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And that's it, we stop at this

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
But in vain

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Because the appearance of the promoter is very important

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Not only that in ordinary t-shirts and caps

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
He does not stand out from the crowd

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
He is simply not seen and does not participate in the promotion

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Secondly, when saving money

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
We simply shift the positioning of our product

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
We do not highlight it, we do not show all its pros and cons

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
The appearance of promoters is especially important

31:36.000 --> 31:44.000
And the suit, and his own hairstyle, and his manner of keeping himself

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
This is all very important

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Therefore, pay attention to this

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
There were cases when there was an ad for elite alcohol

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
And there the girls were in gorgeous dresses

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Of a wonderful look

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
But they saved on hairstyles

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And the image was violated

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
Therefore, if you invest money, invest it all

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
So that the integrity of the image is not violated

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Then the effect will be completely different from your share

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
The next point is the lack of a connecting idea

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
And this is just a problem of looting holes

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
We act not within the framework of the general marketing program

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
We act simply by means of a push

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
The problem has arisen, we need to solve it

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
The problem has arisen, we solve it again

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
And the connecting idea does not work

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Therefore, everyone is responsible for the share

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And if everything was according to plan

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Everything is interconnected

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The synergy would be much higher

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
The next mistake in determining the target audience

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
We have already talked about this in advertising

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
Here, the same thing, the target audience was wrongly determined

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
We just did not get it

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And did not get such an effect

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
The lack of clear reports is also one of the disadvantages

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And the company itself is to blame for this

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Because the company itself must think through the reporting system

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
After all, it needs efficiency

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
We spend money, not someone

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
Therefore, it is in our interests to make a reporting system

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
And to follow up clearly so that all the reporting is filled

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
Then we can calculate the effectiveness of the share

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
A bad organization of regional shares

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Probably, the general problem

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Because we cannot control, we cannot track

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Recommendations should be given to the agency

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
To the network, which has a head office in the central cities

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
And its branches in different cities of the Russian Federation

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
At least they have gained experience

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
In holding such shares

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
And they will do it more professionally than the manager in place

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
And it is not even clear whether these managers are there or not

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Therefore, it is better to trust the professionals

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
The mistake in setting the goals of the promotion companies

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
We say that we need to introduce a new product

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
We leave the goal of increasing the volume of sales

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
This is completely different

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Because when we introduce a new product, it is an introduction to the product

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
The goal was set incorrectly, the mechanics were thought through incorrectly

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
As a result, the share did not work

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
That's all

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Next

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Insufficient allocation of funds for holding the share

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
We regret the money, we say

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Let's save it, cut it here, cut it there

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
As a result, the cut share is worth nothing

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
A clear opinion has been formed

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
If you need to spend something, do it properly

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Better

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
If you want to save, better not to do it at all

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
At least the money will remain intact

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
And so you will spend money, even if you do not achieve results

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
The lack of standard documentation

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
It is a little bit different from the accounting system

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
The lack of standard documentation

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
suggests additional costs for your time

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
If you had standard accounting documentation

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
You would not do it for every share

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
And if you do not have it, you have to think through your resources for every share

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
To make this documentation

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
The mechanics of holding the share are too complicated

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
We talked about it before

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
If it is not clear, it will not work

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Next

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Lack of centers for giving out prizes

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
Many clients are offended that they should get a prize

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
But there is no prize in the center

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Or it is very far to go to the center of the prizes

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
And it creates a negative feeling for your clients

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
If you do not have the opportunity to provide with prizes

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
Then it is better to replace the prizes or think of another share mechanics

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
Because the negative does not forget

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
It is put aside on your product, even if it is very good

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
The program can fall out of the general positioning of the trading brand

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
I gave an example

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
It is repeated with the reason of the inconsistency of the goals

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
If the product is exclusive, do not sell it

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
This is an absolute inconsistency

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
And you can give many other examples

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Next mistake

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Wrong choice of promotion channels

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
We did not ask our clients where they get the information

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
And as a result, this information did not reach them

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
Roughly speaking, we posted the ad in one place

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And our clients walk on the other road

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
That's it

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And the share did not work at all

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Although a lot of money was spent on it

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Next

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Lack of information about the share

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
The consumer does not know what the share is

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
But it is so close

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
Especially in companies that hold shares for their customers

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
For wholesale customers

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
Sales managers just forget to say that this share is held

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
As a result, we reward companies

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
They did not even know that the share was held

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Believe me, it happens so close

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
So, the first thing is control

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Did the information reach the clients?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
The second is feedback

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Do they participate or not?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
If not, why?

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
To know what is the reason and what is the problem

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
We will discuss it next time

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
And the last reason, perhaps the most painful

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Lack of goods in the trading points

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Imagine, the share was developed, the script was made

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Everything was prepared

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
The money was paid

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
And the manager forgot to bring the goods to the trading point

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
And the share was lost

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Yes, such managers probably need to be fired

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
But you need to fire those people who did not control

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
That the manager remembered about it

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Because the manager has a lot of other work

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
He needs to sell

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
And if the marketer is responsible for holding the share

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
He needs to control

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
That everyone did what was necessary step by step

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
So, be sure to control

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
The most painful thing happens

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
When the share does not work because of such reason

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
Well, we have seen the mistakes that happen

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
I want to draw your attention

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
To some shares that I just gave as an example

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
The source of information is btl.ru

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
There are analysed the holding of various shares

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
I would like to give the most successful ones

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
The first share is the share «The Unmissable Moment»

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
It was held with Sony Ericsson mobile phone

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
It is called «Cameraphone»

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
The point of the phone is that you press the button

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
And you get 9 pictures at once

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Not to look for the moment

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
But to take pictures of a person in different ways

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
And to get interesting pictures

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
That's why the share is called «The Unmissable Moment»

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
The share was held in two stages

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
The first one was near the shopping centers

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
There were bright planes with two girls-promoters

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
These girls took pictures of the cameraphone

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
Of the buyers who came to these shopping centers

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
And then these pictures were posted on the website

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
And it was offered to people who took pictures

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
To go to the website and download these pictures

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
The pictures were very interesting

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Children were interested in climbing on this plane

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
And, in general, one way or another

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
They were allowed to use this mobile phone

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
But that's not all

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
The second part of the share was the most interesting

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
In St. Petersburg and Moscow

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Eight business centers were chosen

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
High, multi-storey

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
And the girls-promoters were hired

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
They were wearing parachutes

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
And they were going down the stairs

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
From the roof of this business center

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Four sides of the business center

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
The girls were going down from each side

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Imagine you are sitting on the 30th floor

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
And suddenly a girl appears outside the window

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
What are your feelings?

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
I will tell you that the business centers

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Didn't work that day

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
All the attention was focused on the windows

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
The girls were advertising mobile phones

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000
They were taking pictures of the faces of surprised people

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Who were in these business centers

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
In general, this company made a sensation

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
It cost a lot of money

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
It cost $80,000

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
But I want to say that

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It also received additional information

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
From the media

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Because it was impossible not to write about it

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
And right there in the business centers

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
They started selling these mobile phones

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The promotion was very interesting

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And unusual in its own way

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
The next promotion I want to give as an example

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Was held in Nizhny Novgorod

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
It is called Auto-photo-washing

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
It was a very interesting promotion

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
It was held by Tele2 mobile operator

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
They wanted to expand their presence on the market

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
And everyone who came to the gas station

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
Was offered to buy a SIM-card from Tele2

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The SIM-card cost 100 rubles

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
When the check was issued

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
Two girls of a rather sexy appearance

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Washed the windshield for free

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
For the one who bought such a card

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
I want to say that such a promotion was in great demand for men

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It was very interesting for everyone

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
And in 5 days, I think, this promotion was held

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
In 5 days, more than 2,000 clients

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Used this service

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
The question is, of course, who stayed with this operator

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
But I hope that they stayed

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
The promotion was not so expensive

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
And it was discussed for a long time

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
It was interesting

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
This is another promotion I would like to tell you about

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
This promotion was held by a company called Sveznoi

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
In Novosibirsk, it was called Orange Revolution

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
It was not expensive, but very little

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
And it was very interesting in its own way

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
It was an intriguing promotion

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
It was held in 4 days

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
The first day, this promotion was held in 2005

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
On the first day, in the summer

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
There were many dogs on the streets in orange suits

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It was written on them

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I know, imagine, you go out

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
And the whole city is in orange dogs

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
No one understands what is going on

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Why do people go out in orange suits?

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Dogs were in orange suits for 2 days

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Then they disappeared

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
And the next type of announcement appeared on the poles

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
A dog in an orange suit is missing

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Who knows where it is, please, tell me

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
On this phone

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
All the poles of the city were covered with these announcements

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
People started to discuss

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Radio channels were connected

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
And local radio stations started to discuss

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
Who are these dogs, where did they come from, why, what do they know, where did they disappear

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
It was very well discussed

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Then another day passed

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Orange wallets appeared on the streets of the city

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
People started to pick them up

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
Inside the wallet there was an invitation to open a store

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And a guarantee of a prize

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
A guarantee of a prize

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Then everything started to become clear

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
It turned out that this store was a liaison

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
It was holding an interesting and intriguing promotion

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The next day was the opening of the store

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
Everyone who found orange wallets came

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
They were presented with a gift

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
A T-shirt with the inscription

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
The most honest person in the city

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
And everyone else who came to open this store

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Was given orange oranges

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I will tell you the results

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
They planned to attract 6,000 people to open the store

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
But 30 came

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
This promotion caused such a stir

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
It was not very expensive

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
But it was very interesting

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
It was discussed for a long time and wrote about it

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
I would like to bring you such promotions

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
And to say that if you need an interesting idea

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
I recommend you to contact the agency

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
Which specializes in this

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
And conducts these promotions competently

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
The next day

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Well

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
Another tool is direct marketing

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Or direct marketing events

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Direct mail or email

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Telemarketing

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
With which we work

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
We constantly communicate on the phone with our clients

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It is called direct marketing

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Because it is a direct personal appeal to our client

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
It works very effectively

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
If this strategy is planned

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
If it is not a one-time event

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
Which we planned to do once and forgot about it

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
Direct marketing events allow you to maintain the database in the current state constantly

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
Get feedback from the client

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
Then make a confidential offer

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Communicate with them personally

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Find out their claims, fix them and eliminate them

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
There is a very large field of work here

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
Which allows you to achieve the personalization we are talking about

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Although today

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
Maybe some people think that it goes back to the past

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Nevertheless, direct mail or email

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
If it is done properly and clearly

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
It gives very good results

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Relative to its cost

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
What are the disadvantages?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Firstly, not everyone reads

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Naturally

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
And the effectiveness of the mail

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
If it is 3-6%

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
It is very good

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
As I said, relative to the cost

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
It justifies itself very well

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Therefore, even if 3 or 6%

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Turned to you after sending

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
This is a great result

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
Consider that you have achieved what you wanted

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
What is related to direct marketing?

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
Firstly, incoming calls

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
What can we do with incoming calls?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Firstly, of course

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Tell the information about our products

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
Secondly, recommend certain things

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
If we don't have something, switch to another product of our client

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Next, set up contacts

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
It is important to put this contact in the database

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Which will be relevant

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Because the client contacted us himself

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
And hold some competitions

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
You can do it by phone or email

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Among those clients

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Who contact us on their own

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
You can also react

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
Or work with incoming calls

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
What can we do with them?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Of course, accept orders

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
We call the buyers

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
And accept orders from them

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Next, just to set up contacts

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
To get acquainted

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
To find additional clients

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
It is a good tool

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Next, conduct marketing researches and surveys

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
And create your own database based on it

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
Which will be constantly updated and supported

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
It is a very inexpensive way

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
To analyze the market, to analyze claims

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
To analyze the wishes of clients

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
It is a good communication with current clients

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
With our regular clients

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
We do it regularly with you

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
We communicate regularly

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
We find out questions, problems, wishes, etc.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
And, of course, it is a communication tool

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
After conducting a certain promotion

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
To evaluate the results

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
How did it go, what worked, what didn't work

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
What did you like, what didn't, etc.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
In fact, it is a very valuable source of information

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Which we don't always use effectively

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
Nevertheless, I'd like to tell you about the effectiveness of direct marketing

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
With the table you can see on your slide

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Regarding mail orders

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
If we take 100% of mail orders

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Only 88% of them are opened

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
12% are thrown out immediately

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
They are not even opened

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
What happens to the remaining 88%?

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
40% are read by the person who is not intended

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
40% are read by the person who is intended

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
And 8% are thrown out again, not read

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
Now, what does the person who is intended do with them?

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
24% of them he reads and throws out

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
He thinks they are not interesting

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
10% is put aside

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
He thinks, well, I'll deal with it later

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
And only 6% get an answer

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Only 6% become relevant

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
And this is a very good result

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
It's worse if such a percentage is 1-2

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
It means that either your database is irrelevant

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Or your commercial offer was absolutely not interesting

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
For your key client

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
You have wrongly determined his wishes

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
That's how

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
You can also read additional material

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
In your lecture notebook

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
On direct marketing events

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
I would like to touch on the form of accountability

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
And the control of the event

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I would like to say that according to the results

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
All planned events

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
A media plan is being developed

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
You can see its appearance on the slide

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Where we describe each event

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
And we describe when it is held

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
What is held and where

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
And the budget size is necessarily written

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Then the budget size is summed up

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
By periods, by months, by quarters

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
As you prefer

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Why do you need such media plans?

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
Not only to plan and strictly follow this plan

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
They are also needed for political reasons

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
If you have a media plan

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
In which all budget costs are written

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
It is unlikely that the manager will emphasize something

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
By optimizing the budget

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
When you have a common figure

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
It is easier to emphasize

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
We do not know what it is spent on

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
And there is a temptation to sequester this amount

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
When you have all events clearly written

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
It is unlikely that the manager will raise his hand

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
To emphasize a certain amount

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Because we clearly understand

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
What, what event and what we need it for

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Therefore, I highly recommend

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
Planning and signing a plan and budget

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
From your management

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
In conclusion, we will touch on the calculation of event efficiency

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
I will tell you the main formulas

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
By which efficiency is calculated

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
And you will have tables in your workbooks

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
And there will be tasks on calculating the efficiency of certain actions

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Where everything is clearly written

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
By formulas, what to calculate, what costs we take into account, etc.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
So

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
What are we holding the actions for?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Yes, probably, for increasing sales

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
To achieve a certain result

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
To ensure the popularity of the product

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
But I want to say

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
That the efficiency of the actions can be calculated

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
Only by stimulating sales

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
The efficiency of advertising can also be calculated

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
But it will not be accurate

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Because there, except for the economic effect

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
There is a communication effect

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
The number of contacts, the increase in the recognition, etc.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
You can find out these things

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Only by contacting the agency

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And conducting an additional survey of consumers

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Many companies simply do not go for this

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Because these are additional costs

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
This can be done at least once a year

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
To understand and assess the popularity of your brand or your trademark

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
But the economic efficiency

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
The easiest and most effective way

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Is to calculate it by events, by stimulating sales

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
And here are the main formulas

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
The first formula is the formula of profitability

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Everyone knows it

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
When we take the additional sales

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
The sum of additional sales

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
We subtract the cost of the product

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Which we additionally sold

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
And the expenses for the event itself

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
And we divide all this by expenses

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You, of course, get the coefficient

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
If this coefficient is less than 1

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Your share was loss

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
If it is equal to 1

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Then your share has gone to 0

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Roughly speaking, how much you received

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And how much you spent

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
But if your share

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
The coefficient of loss is more than 1

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
You have already worked for the company's profit

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
Naturally, the higher the coefficient, the better

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
It can be 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
It is ideal

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Naturally, the higher it is, the better

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
The main thing is that it is more than 1

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Then your share worked effectively

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And one more formula

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
Which will help you calculate the efficiency of the share

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
It is the definition of the share of expenses

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
In the additional product turnover

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
What is the point of this calculation?

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Look, for example, you sold the product

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
And additionally sold 100 units for 1,000 rubles

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
So, you received 100,000 additional rubles

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
But how much you spent from this sum

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
You need to determine

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Not the share from the total turnover

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Which was sold

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Because the total could be sold without the share

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
How much additional income you spent

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
It is important

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
It shows how much additional money you earned

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
And this formula works very well and effectively

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
It shows what your owner wants to see

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
You calculate this

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You take all the expenses

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Which you spent on the share

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
You divide it by the additional income you received

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
And multiply it by 100%

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
And you get the share of additional income

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
Note, not in the total, but in the additional

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
This is how you can calculate the share

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
It is a whole formula

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
Which is described in detail in your work materials

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
You can refer to it

53:55.000 --> 54:00.000
And do the practical work

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
The task of calculating the efficiency of a particular share

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
How to use the advertising tool

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Dear colleagues

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Or if it is in your company's portfolio for a long time

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
We have seen how to use the advertising tool

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
How to use the public communication tools

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000

And bringing new brands and new interesting positions to the Russian market

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
All the best, goodbye
