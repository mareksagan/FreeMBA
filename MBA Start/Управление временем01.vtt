00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I am Lukashenko Marianna Anatolievna,

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
I am the prorector of the Moscow Financial and Industrial Academy for Continuous Education,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Doctor of Economics, Professor.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
In addition, I am an expert consultant of the company Organization of Time,

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
leading business training in such companies as Ingustrach, SubMiller and many others.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
And now I would like to get acquainted with you.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Please tell me, you are certainly successful managers or specialists,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
who have enough time to decide on everything.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
You have time not only to work, but also to live.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
You leave work on time, you read a lot of interesting books,

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
you go to theaters, admire the nature, communicate with your family, with our younger brothers.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Yes, that's right?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
You know, then you probably can not watch anything else.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
But I believe that in 95 cases out of 100, this is not quite so.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
And the topic of our conversation is time management, the organization of our time.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So, pay attention to the slide.

01:15.000 --> 01:24.000
We will talk about the most important things in the field of organization of our time.

01:24.000 --> 01:33.000
About timing, how to measure what our time consists of, what we spend it on, what distracts us,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
what prevents us from being more effective.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
We will talk to you about planning tasks.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
This is a very powerful story related to the organization of our time.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
And finally, we will talk to you about how to rest properly during the working day,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
so as not to overload and not to get tired completely.

01:59.000 --> 02:09.000
We will talk to you about how to motivate yourself to perform complex, unpleasant, long, voluminous tasks.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
So, we will talk to you about the most key stories in the field of organization of time.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Of course, this is not all we need to know.

02:21.000 --> 02:33.000
But we will also consider the literature from which we can draw significantly more materials and information in the field of organization of time.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So, have a good trip!

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Let's define the concept of time management with you.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Please look at the slide definition of time management.

02:45.000 --> 02:58.000
This is a technology that allows us to use the inexhaustible time of our life in accordance with our personal goals, values and priorities.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Why didn't I pay attention to business goals?

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Because business goals are, of course, subordinate to many of our personal goals.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
Work is a very important component of our life, and no one disputes that.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
Another thing is that we need to work to maximize our performance, to make us interested, to make us happy,

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
so that we leave work full of energy and strength in order to still have time for everything else,

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
which is of interest and importance to us, in addition to work.

03:37.000 --> 03:49.000
So, time management is associated with something Western, which came to us with Perestroika, but this is definitely not so.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
In the former Soviet Union there was a luxurious school of organization of time.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
And there are key figures of world fame in the field of organization of time.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
First of all, they are Alexei Kapitonovich Gastev and Platon Mikhailovich Kerzhentsev.

04:07.000 --> 04:16.000
The development of the domestic school of organization of time dates back to the 1920s.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
So, the 1920s. The Central Institute of Labor in the former Soviet Union.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
Its director, Alexei Gastev, a man who was in correspondence with Ford and Taylor,

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
a man who introduced the methodology of a narrow base into scientific circulation for the first time.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
What does it mean?

04:37.000 --> 04:47.000
It means that the efficiency of a company, the efficiency of production in general, depends on the efficiency of each of us at our workplace.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
Imagine, the 1920s, a time when one plus one is zero, there are no irreplaceable.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
The idea is widely destroyed by the modernists.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
However, as we know, this is a key message, a key paradigm of modern management.

05:05.000 --> 05:15.000
Combine the interests of business and the interests of everyone, and a person will pull the whole company forward to achieve his goals.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The year 1926. Another meeting of the Soviets is taking place.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Several thousand people are sitting in a huge hall.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
An American journalist is sitting next to Platon Mikhailovich Kerzhentsev.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
The meeting is scheduled for 11, but it does not start at 12 or 1.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
And the journalist turns to Kerzhentsev and asks,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
How many people are there in the hall?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Three and a half thousand. Who are they?

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
Among them are workers of different specialties, engineering and technical workers, various specialists.

05:54.000 --> 06:03.000
Kerzhentsev sees how the American journalist starts to read something in a notebook.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
Then he says, but let me, during this time it was possible to build one or two airplanes.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
And Kerzhentsev writes in an article, Time to Build Airplanes.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
It is time to stop measuring time in some abstract quantities and being late in abstract quantities.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
And it is necessary to measure in the same product that could be produced during this time.

06:30.000 --> 06:41.000
The article receives a colossal public response in the country called Liga Vremya.

06:41.000 --> 06:50.000
Its department is created at almost every enterprise, in every company, in every organization.

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
People, without the participation of the state, begin to develop some time-saving technologies.

06:59.000 --> 07:10.000
It becomes so fashionable, it is so fascinating that even Ilf and Petrov cannot pass by it in the famous Golden Velvet.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
When Antelope Gnus makes a car run on the off-road and wilderness,

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
in one village she is met by a group of comrades with a banner.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Hello Liga Vremya and its leader, comrade Kerzhentsev.

07:26.000 --> 07:35.000
So Ilf and Petrov note that this idea becomes a key idea of the modern world.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
Sorry, when it is appropriate and when it is not.

07:41.000 --> 07:55.000
But the new economic policy, which coincided with the development of Liga Vremya,

07:55.000 --> 08:08.000
unfortunately, ceases and together with it the work of Liga Vremya ends.

08:08.000 --> 08:18.000
And the next stage of the formation of the National School of Organization of Time is only in the 70s,

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
when the book by Daniil Granin is published, it is called,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
A Strange Life, by biologist Lyubishev.

08:25.000 --> 08:35.000
This is a man who set the goal of his life to create a table of biological elements, like the table of Mendeleev.

08:35.000 --> 08:45.000
And when he began to calculate how much time he would need for this, it turned out to be 150 years of human life.

08:45.000 --> 08:57.000
Realizing the senselessness of what is happening, he begins to study the National School of Organization of Time very carefully.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
He begins to chronometer the costs of his own time.

09:01.000 --> 09:12.000
He begins to look at how much time it takes to solve a particular task, a particular job, a particular activity.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
And a paradox arises. He manages to do it 100 times more.

09:17.000 --> 09:30.000
But in the meantime, he begins to live a full life. He reads a lot. He devotes time to his family, nature, his development.

09:30.000 --> 09:40.000
It would seem that he lives a full life, and in the meantime, he manages to do 100 times more than before.

09:40.000 --> 09:53.000
And this book falls into the hands of a young student of the Mathematical Faculty of the St. Petersburg State University, Gleb Arkhangelsky.

09:53.000 --> 10:01.000
And he realizes that it completely coincides with his world perception.

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
He begins to study the problem of time organization. He begins to look at what was developed in the former Soviet Union.

10:09.000 --> 10:21.000
He begins to study everything that was developed in the West on this topic and what works in the chaotic modern Russian business environment.

10:21.000 --> 10:36.000
Being a professional mathematician, he creates time management models and, based on these models, designs techniques and technologies of modern time management.

10:36.000 --> 10:46.000
In 2000, under his leadership, the first time management community was created in Russia.

10:46.000 --> 11:06.000
Its address is presented in your workbooks. This is the 3W Improvement.ru. There are the latest, most modern, most relevant materials and developments of the members of the time management community.

11:06.000 --> 11:27.000
These are people who are interested in the problem of time organization. These are HR, managers who are fed up with the lack of time and come up with the most suitable techniques and technologies for them.

11:28.000 --> 11:43.000
We will consider the technologies of time organization, which were developed in the company of the time organization under the leadership of Gleb Arkhangelsky.

11:43.000 --> 12:03.000
Now, please open your workbooks on the second page and let's try to answer the question, please tell me how much time do we have? What is the time resource that we have in the hours?

12:03.000 --> 12:18.000
Of course, we don't guess anything, we don't tempt fate, of course, the one who has been given the time will have the same amount of time.

12:18.000 --> 12:35.000
But still, what are the average numbers? I see someone is pulling the calculator, and someone is guessing at a discount, maybe it's 10,000 hours, maybe it's a million hours, maybe several million. Let's try to figure it out.

12:35.000 --> 12:59.000
So, the table in our workbook. So, what is our capital of time? Fill in the table. My age, please indicate your age in the table. The second line is the assessment of the time of completion. What is it? How old would you like to live?

12:59.000 --> 13:14.000
Please write realistic numbers to get a very realistic resource. You can write average numbers, you can write a little higher, but in any case, it is desirable that these are quite realistic data.

13:14.000 --> 13:37.000
The next line is my capital of time in years. What you got in the second line, we subtract what we got in the first line. The next line is my capital of time in days. What we got in the third line, we multiply by 365 days.

13:38.000 --> 14:00.000
And now let's look at the most important time consumption in our future life. The number of hours needed for a day's sleep. So, depending on how much time you spend on sleep per day, please indicate this figure in the table.

14:01.000 --> 14:19.000
This will be an average number. Perhaps it will be 6 hours, perhaps 8 hours. The next line is the number of active hours per day. 24 hours minus what you got in the fifth line.

14:19.000 --> 14:48.000
And finally, the last line is my capital of time in hours. What you got in the fourth line, we multiply by what you got in the sixth line. And now compare this with the number you called at the very beginning, when we just tried to find out for a discount, without calculations, our time resource.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
So, 200-400 thousand hours on average. What is it?

14:57.000 --> 15:15.000
As we can see, there are no capitalists among us. We all own a very, very small capital of time. And we are all equal to time. This is the first and very important conclusion from what we have just done.

15:16.000 --> 15:31.000
The second, no less important conclusion. We do not feel our time. If I asked you now, how much money do you have? Well, maybe you wouldn't say it out loud. But you've determined enough about yourself.

15:31.000 --> 15:39.000
However, when we say how much time we have, there is no answer.

15:39.000 --> 15:59.000
However, let's compare these two concepts. If we lost 1000 rubles, 10,000, 20,000 rubles, it's disgusting. Agree, it's extremely unpleasant, but it's doable. We'll make some more money.

15:59.000 --> 16:09.000
When we lost 10-20 hours of time, we will never, by any means, remember these hours.

16:09.000 --> 16:34.000
Again, if they try to steal 100 rubles from us, we react nervously to it. And when every day we are inhumanly robbed of our time by hours, we react very, very philosophically. Well, what to do? Well, how to deal with it? And you can't do anything about it.

16:35.000 --> 17:00.000
So, let's look at another picture in our workbook, which is presented here below. This is a time pie. And let's try to make this time pie in accordance with our time resource, which we still have ahead.

17:00.000 --> 17:22.000
So, on the circle, put a dot anywhere. Starting from this point, please calculate the number of sectors equal to your age. The fact is that in this circle, 70 sectors is the average life span of a person.

17:22.000 --> 17:35.000
So, calculate the number of sectors equal to your age and make a dot. This is the time you have already lived.

17:35.000 --> 18:04.000
Now let's look at what we still have ahead. So, if we spend about 8 hours a day on sleep, then boldly select a third of the remaining time. Isn't it 24 hours a day and 8 is a third of our daily time?

18:05.000 --> 18:25.000
So, we spend a third of our future life on sleep. And now let's see how much time we will spend on some aimless expectations, during which you can't read or listen to music.

18:25.000 --> 18:43.000
You can only wait for something sad and gloomy. In general, probably three years of our future life will go away safely. Perhaps, God forbid, we will get sick for a while.

18:43.000 --> 18:59.000
So, in general, we will spend some more time on sleep. Please look at how much very, very small piece of pie remains for a couple of cups of tea.

18:59.000 --> 19:16.000
And our task is to stretch this pie, make it as delicious, as nutritious, as useful, as necessary for us. And this is what we will do now.

19:16.000 --> 19:41.000
So, our first story is a chronometer. Any project, as we know, starts with research. So, before we try to change something in the organization of our time, we need to understand what this time is made of and what prevents us from being more effective.

19:41.000 --> 20:00.000
And this is what a chronometer is for. Please look at the slide. It shows a photo of the working day using the Kerzhentsy chronograph. This is the same Platon Mikhailovich Kerzhentsy, the creator of the League of Time.

20:00.000 --> 20:20.000
The basis of the chronograph is a graph of the Gantt, which shows our tasks that we do during the day. This is in terms of lines, and in terms of columns, a time grid is presented.

20:20.000 --> 20:39.000
The time grid depends on what we want to take into account. If we want to take into account the costs of our working time, then we start from the beginning of our working day and end, respectively, the time of the end of our working day.

20:50.000 --> 21:17.000
If we want to take into account the costs of our working time, then we start from the beginning of our working day and end, respectively, the time of the end of our working day.

21:17.000 --> 21:37.000
What is it? In column P, we note the tasks that are the priority for us and for the company as a whole. In column D, we note the tasks that we performed ourselves, although we could not delegate them.

21:37.000 --> 22:01.000
Of course, the chronograph is conducted in real time. For example, you held a meeting and recorded that you held it from 11 to 12.50.

22:01.000 --> 22:13.000
You held some phone conversations and noted that these phone conversations lasted from 12.50 to 13.00.

22:13.000 --> 22:33.000
This is how you record all the work that you had during the working day.

22:33.000 --> 22:53.000
First, in the order of the experiment, at least during one working day, you should record all the work that you have done. Ideally, the time should be conducted at least during the week.

22:53.000 --> 23:12.000
But in order to try this technique, right here and now, you could fill in the chronograph in your workbook with your current day or your yesterday.

23:12.000 --> 23:29.000
Let's see what we get. We recorded all the work that we did and we tied them to a certain time during which these works were performed.

23:29.000 --> 23:48.000
In column P, we note the tasks that are the priority for us and for the company. In column D, we note the tasks that we could delegate, but we decided to do them ourselves.

23:48.000 --> 24:12.000
What to do with these tasks? Below, in your workbook, you have a table with an express analysis of the data obtained. First of all, we need to calculate the percentage of time spent on long-term priority tasks.

24:12.000 --> 24:30.000
This percentage of time is designated in scientific literature as 70-80% of our working day.

24:30.000 --> 24:46.000
But in reality, unfortunately, this is not the case. Even if you have spent 50% on priority tasks, even if 40%, it is still a good result.

24:46.000 --> 25:05.000
Next, the second line. The percentage of time for tasks that you could delegate. According to time management rules, this figure should not exceed 10%.

25:05.000 --> 25:27.000
If more than 10% of your tasks are tasks that you decide on your own, even if you could delegate them, then there are problems. Problems with organizing business processes, problems with organizing your personal management, and so on.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
These are the indicators that need to be corrected.

25:31.000 --> 25:41.000
And finally, the percentage of time not taken into account. What is it about? What do you think can prevent us from doing time management?

25:41.000 --> 25:58.000
I'm sure many of you say, we have no time to do time management, we are already insanely busy. I understand you very well. Several years ago, I said the same thing.

25:58.000 --> 26:19.000
We try to do time management, even if we try from the bottom of our hearts. But unfortunately, we are busy and we really forget about it.

26:20.000 --> 26:36.000
What to do? Of course, immediately throw the time and resume it, as we often do with the charge from the next Monday or from the next month, or better from the next year.

26:36.000 --> 26:56.000
So, since the temptation is great, really immediately stop doing time management, then we provide a separate line, forgot and God with him. As I remembered, I will fix the moment that I remembered and continue to do time management.

26:56.000 --> 27:10.000
And do not tempt yourself, do not stop time management. Let's pay attention to the steps of time management. Please see, they are presented to you on the slide.

27:10.000 --> 27:30.000
So, the first. For several days, we record all the work done for 10-15 minutes. Perhaps you will say, but I need to record all the work from 5 minutes. Please record, but do not get too involved.

27:30.000 --> 27:48.000
The fact is that time management also requires time. If we record our tasks from 15 minutes, in fact, it takes a little time. Just a day, 15-20 minutes maximum.

27:48.000 --> 28:04.000
However, if we start to scrupulously record 3-5-minute tasks, it takes 45 minutes. This is the first. The second. Will not we get caught in an avalanche of information?

28:04.000 --> 28:26.000
After all, imagine a list of 3-minute tasks can be very, very voluminous. With him, you need to do something, we should not do time management for the sake of time management itself. As a result, we must take some steps to optimize our time, make ourselves more effective.

28:26.000 --> 28:44.000
So, what does it all lead to? The second. We outline 2-3 key indicators. What are these indicators? This is what we would like to change.

28:44.000 --> 29:13.000
For example, we may not be satisfied with the fact that every day we are delayed at work for 2 hours. Or maybe we are determinedly not satisfied that we spend half an hour a day with our little son. Or maybe we are not satisfied that we do not devote time to fitness, or sports, or walking, or reading, whatever.

29:13.000 --> 29:28.000
So, we start working with indicators that are needed from our point of view in the adjustment. For this we need to first find out their actual values.

29:28.000 --> 29:53.000
And finally, we track these indicators in the dynamics. And what is most curious and most entertaining, perhaps, these indicators themselves decisively without our participation change for the better.

29:54.000 --> 30:06.000
So, as soon as we start tracking some indicators in the dynamics, they themselves begin to improve, that is, change in the right direction.

30:07.000 --> 30:21.000
So, what are the examples of indicators? The next slide. If my goal is to leave work on time, then the indicator is the duration of the delay after work.

30:21.000 --> 30:38.000
If my goal is to devote more time to priority projects, then the indicator is the amount of time a day devoted to a priority project, as well as the percentage of such time from the total working time.

30:38.000 --> 31:02.000
If my goal is to lessen the strain on work, in the normal sense of the word, that is, to do more work, but with less energy consumption, then the indicator is the amount of time a day spent in a resourceful, highly energetic working state.

31:03.000 --> 31:10.000
So, what are the rules of timing? Pay attention to the next slide.

31:11.000 --> 31:25.000
During the day, we only take a picture of the working day. We do not try to analyze the costs of our time during the working day.

31:25.000 --> 31:40.000
Any analysis we take to the evening part and start in a calm environment, when we have already finished working, we start to look at what our working day consisted of.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
This is the first key principle of timing.

31:44.000 --> 32:02.000
The second key principle is to make this process pleasant and tasty for yourself.

32:02.000 --> 32:27.000
If you like paper media, buy a bright, beautiful, leather notebook that you like, a nice color, a nice notebook that you would like to play with, a notebook that would be in front of you, a notebook that would attract your attention, a notebook that would be of interest to others.

32:27.000 --> 32:52.000
If you like some beautiful blanks in Excel, make yourself a luxurious schedule in which everything will be automatically summed up, make it pleasant, interesting.

32:52.000 --> 33:09.000
Of course, you can use reminders to not forget about the timing. You can put a sound reminder on your mobile phone so that you do not forget the timing.

33:09.000 --> 33:31.000
Rule number three. Your task is not to get an objective picture. What is it?

33:31.000 --> 33:44.000
If you spend time in vain or not quite effectively, you start to make sharp movements in this direction.

33:44.000 --> 34:04.000
You know, people change the circle of communication. People refuse to be friends, not friends, but friends who like to talk about nothing for a long time.

34:04.000 --> 34:17.000
In fact, this is not entirely harmless and it is not worth making revolutions in your life, which we pay attention to in the next item.

34:17.000 --> 34:30.000
In the same way, you do not need to get up at 6 o'clock and leave the room proudly at work.

34:30.000 --> 34:45.000
Of course, you don't need to. Our work includes force majeure, tasks that need to be done urgently, you need to be late.

34:45.000 --> 35:05.000
You don't need to tell yourself, I have to leave on time today, I have a schedule.

35:05.000 --> 35:17.000
And for this, we will encourage ourselves for the timing, for its conduct, as it is indicated in the next item.

35:17.000 --> 35:32.000
I have a schedule for a day. In the evening I will eat some delicious chocolate. I have been doing this for a week and it is wonderful.

35:32.000 --> 35:58.000
It is very important that we have a very important thought on how we will spend the time that we have free as a result of timing.

35:58.000 --> 36:07.000
From here flows a certain desire, a term that came from the theory of the regime of inventive tasks, STRISA.

36:07.000 --> 36:16.000
The fact is that they never call things their own names in order to get away from the stereotype of thinking.

36:16.000 --> 36:26.000
For example, if you need to invent a new shovel, then you are told that you need a thing that will perform the following functions.

36:26.000 --> 36:36.000
So we need a certain desire in our time management, which is not enough time now, which is pleasant.

36:36.000 --> 36:51.000
I want to read something, I want to see something, go somewhere, talk to someone, drink beer with friends, chat.

36:51.000 --> 37:12.000
I want to chat so aimlessly. I want to and I reward myself for doing the timing so carefully for a whole week and tracking all the time spent on what was right, reasonable and perhaps not quite rational.

37:12.000 --> 37:27.000
So the next slide is to write out the desire, but now there is not enough time and on which we will begin to allocate time that is released with us with the help of timing.

37:27.000 --> 37:34.000
And in this regard, the question arises, how to be with timing now?

37:34.000 --> 37:49.000
Well, we optimized some indicators, we began to leave work on time in most of our time and we began to devote more time to our family, our children, reading.

37:49.000 --> 37:57.000
And what now? When do I stop with timing? Or do I have to do it all my life?

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
And everything is very simple, as you are comfortable, so you do.

38:02.000 --> 38:11.000
There are people who have been doing timing all their lives and for them it is quite natural, how to take a shower, how to brush your teeth.

38:11.000 --> 38:20.000
For others, everything is completely wrong and then we recommend holding a certain disciplinary week.

38:20.000 --> 38:40.000
That is, for a week you are doing the timing, you have found the very costs of time that interfere with your efficiency, you have undertaken certain actions to minimize or eliminate these costs of time at all.

38:40.000 --> 38:56.000
And that's it, you stopped. Somewhere in 2-3 months, when you feel that you again have a need to optimize your working time, you again do the timing and so on.

38:56.000 --> 39:05.000
And let's summarize and determine the advantages of timing.

39:05.000 --> 39:15.000
So, the important result of timing is that the indicators we need are optimized themselves.

39:15.000 --> 39:25.000
An important result of timing is that we get an objective picture of time, including the long-term perspective.

39:25.000 --> 39:33.000
We also acquire new important information about ourselves and our personal growth reserves.

39:33.000 --> 39:47.000
In fact, there are very curious examples when we are told by large and serious managers, everything is fine with us, with the organization of time, we have enough time for everything.

39:47.000 --> 39:58.000
But after spending literally a week of timing, they write to us and say that we have found unprecedented reserves of time.

39:58.000 --> 40:09.000
If someone told me that I have 1.5-2 hours of free time during the day, I would never believe it.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
Thus, we really get a lot of new information about ourselves.

40:14.000 --> 40:24.000
In addition, it is an opportunity to track improvements in quantity and manage your time based on facts, not opinions.

40:24.000 --> 40:34.000
And finally, the most important thing is to develop the feeling of time and the feeling of efficiency.

40:34.000 --> 40:52.000
The result of timing is that in a few days we have a slightly tingling feeling of efficiency or inefficiency of the process.

40:52.000 --> 41:05.000
For example, we talk on the phone and suddenly feel that this conversation is losing efficiency and becomes just a chat.

41:05.000 --> 41:13.000
We feel like some negotiations are losing their efficiency.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
This is the most important result of timing.

41:18.000 --> 41:27.000
We also begin to feel how much time a particular task takes, and in management this is very important.

41:27.000 --> 41:41.000
We naturally acquire new information about how much time our subordinates and colleagues will need to complete a particular task.

41:42.000 --> 41:54.000
We return to our very important question, what can prevent us from keeping the timing?

41:54.000 --> 42:01.000
Indeed, someone will say to me, and this is the most common answer,

42:01.000 --> 42:12.000
but many people are, frankly, too lazy or just forget, just do not want to deal with it.

42:12.000 --> 42:20.000
In this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the following slide.

42:20.000 --> 42:30.000
In it, in fact, is presented a woodcutter who is desperately trying to split this churbak.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
The fact is that there is a wonderful story about this.

42:34.000 --> 42:50.000
Once the villagers were amazed that the next day in the forest the woodcutter's axe was handed out, and it sounded strictly in one place and nothing else was happening.

42:50.000 --> 43:04.000
They went to find out what was going on and saw a completely exhausted woodcutter who was trying to cut the same unfortunate tree with a completely blunt axe.

43:04.000 --> 43:13.000
After observing this process for some time, they said, what are you doing? Go sharpen the axe.

43:13.000 --> 43:20.000
What do you think the woodcutter said? Of course, I have no time, I have to cut.

43:21.000 --> 43:36.000
Therefore, very often we spare time for the most important, for the most investment, for what works for our efficiency, for our future, for our development, for our health.

43:36.000 --> 43:49.000
We spend, we spare time for the optimization of certain processes and in this regard we are suppressing this woodcutter.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
Why did we do all this? Why did we conduct a chronometrage?

43:55.000 --> 44:05.000
I believe that I managed to convince you that this is really an important time-manager technique and it is worth trying.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
But you need to understand why we are doing all this.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
We do all this to identify time swallowers.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
The definition of time swallower is on your next slide.

44:18.000 --> 44:28.000
So, time swallower is any business, time spending that we want to reduce.

44:29.000 --> 44:36.000
Let's pay attention to the fact that there is no unified list of time swallowers.

44:37.000 --> 45:03.000
For example, if we were running around the city all day, if we were talking all day, then most of all in the world we want to fall on some chair and maybe at this moment a computer swallower will be the most necessary rest in which we need so much.

45:03.000 --> 45:20.000
But at another time when we worked on the computer all day and we have a neck, back, head, eyes under load, and we decided to rest and we switched to another resource.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
We went to a computer swallower.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
Does our neck continue to be under load? Yes, of course.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
And the back, and the eyes, and the head.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
Well, it's a little easier in the head, but not so much.

45:33.000 --> 45:50.000
In this case, it is really a time swallower because it only prevents us from working, resting, and coming to our resource state.

45:50.000 --> 45:57.000
Let's see what can be a time swallower.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
It can be an expectation.

46:00.000 --> 46:14.000
Expectations while we are going somewhere, spending time on the road, when we are standing in traffic, when we are waiting for our flight to the airport.

46:14.000 --> 46:23.000
A time swallower can be a phone conversation with a friend or a girlfriend, nothing.

46:24.000 --> 46:30.000
It's not necessarily our friend, maybe it's a client, a VIP client.

46:30.000 --> 46:39.000
We can't finish the conversation with him, but he says and says and says, and there is no end to it.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
What to do with it is completely incomprehensible.

46:42.000 --> 46:48.000
These are some processes that are simply not effectively organized.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
And this is what we will work with you now.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
So, please look at the slide.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
You have a task there.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
This is a task for a task that is presented in the workbook.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
So let's look at our workbook.

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
So please open the workbook on page 5.

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
And look at the data of a certain manager.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
What needs to be done?

47:23.000 --> 47:29.000
First, analyze the photo of the day that the manager made.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
Second, identify the time swallower.

47:34.000 --> 47:41.000
Third, offer some improvements to the organization of his work.

47:41.000 --> 47:48.000
And finally, count the time we have gained from these improvements.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
And now, please, pause and complete this task.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
So, the task is completed.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Let's see what we got.

48:00.000 --> 48:09.000
Let's pay attention to the fact that our manager spends a lot of time on email.

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
Do you see how many times he looked at the email?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Seven times.

48:16.000 --> 48:25.000
At the same time, once at night, once early in the morning, and five more times during the working day.

48:25.000 --> 48:31.000
How effective are these time-saving data?

48:31.000 --> 48:39.000
If your job is to constantly monitor email, of course.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
Of course, this time-saving is effective.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
But very often it is not quite so.

48:47.000 --> 48:55.000
We recommend that you reduce your work with email to two times a day.

48:55.000 --> 49:02.000
And you should press this work with email by the end of some working period.

49:02.000 --> 49:11.000
For example, the first time you should work with email in an hour and a half before lunch.

49:11.000 --> 49:20.000
And the second time you should look at email in the second half of the day, around 5 or 4 o'clock.

49:20.000 --> 49:28.000
But, of course, this does not mean that you did not look at email in the morning.

49:28.000 --> 49:38.000
You can look at it, look at some urgent tasks that you have to do at the very beginning of the working day.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And you can do it. What is it for?

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
In order to correct your current workday plan.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
But do not enter the correspondence.

49:48.000 --> 49:58.000
Postpone all this until you do the main, most important, key tasks for a fresh start.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
And after that, proceed to the temporary correspondence.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
So, the first is to work with email and its optimization.

50:08.000 --> 50:19.000
The second is that our manager spends a lot of time on the preparation for the presentation.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
And we highlight two components of it.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
The first is that our manager prepares himself.

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
And the second is that some people constantly come to him.

50:30.000 --> 50:39.000
And he deals with them and instructs them to the presentation.

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
What could we recommend to our manager?

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
Of course, to gather a meeting.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
Of course, to gather all the people who will be involved in this presentation.

50:52.000 --> 50:59.000
And, of course, to give the necessary instructions, discuss some issues.

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
After that, if necessary, organize the final instruction of the team.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
But in no case do not deal with each separately.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
The same with your preparation.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
You do not need to break it.

51:13.000 --> 51:19.000
You have allocated some time, sat down, prepared for the presentation.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
And completed, switched to other types of activities.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
What else is important?

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
There are tasks that could be delegated.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
For example, call Irina on the preparation of the presentation.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
To clarify the time of the presentation.

51:42.000 --> 51:51.000
Of course, you should not spend 34 minutes to call someone yourself.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
Even if we do not have the opportunity to delegate this task,

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
but we called, we did not reach and without spending this time,

52:02.000 --> 52:10.000
we make the next call at least in 20-30 minutes, and so on.

52:10.000 --> 52:16.000
And finally, please pay attention to the road to work.

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
It takes an hour and 40 minutes to get to work.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
And it takes 49 minutes to get home.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
Perhaps the fact is that in the morning he gets into a traffic jam.

52:31.000 --> 52:37.000
And maybe it makes sense to recommend him to leave a little earlier.

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
And this time was spent on lunch, which he did not have.

52:43.000 --> 52:49.000
Please note that our manager is completely busy.

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
He spends 18 minutes for breakfast, about the same for dinner.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
He does not have lunch at all, sleeps 5 hours.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Note that our manager will not last so long.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
So, techniques for fighting swallowing.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Attention to the slide.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
Reducing the fine details of work.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
We combine work in blocks.

53:16.000 --> 53:25.000
We combine time for instructing our employees, our subordinates, for communicating with them.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
We combine time for working with email.

53:29.000 --> 53:35.000
We combine time for phone calls.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
The next position is to normalize the time for the flow.

53:41.000 --> 53:49.000
The fact is that during the day we have to perform a lot of tasks.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
We allocate time for them.

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
We allocate time to prepare some reports, some reports.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
As in our case, to prepare for the presentation.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
We do not waste this time.

54:04.000 --> 54:12.000
If we are distracted 4 times during 2 hours,

54:12.000 --> 54:21.000
then our total time of work on this task will be not 3 hours,

54:21.000 --> 54:28.000
but 2 hours plus 4 times for 15 minutes.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
And much more.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
But imagine a locomotive from point A to point B goes without stopping.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
How much time will it take?

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
And when it stops at each half-stop, how much time in the end?

54:43.000 --> 54:48.000
So is our priceless brain, our priceless head.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
It is not necessary to distract it.

54:50.000 --> 54:56.000
Let it concentrate on performing some task.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
We normalize the time.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
Next, we manage the workload.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
We allocate time for lunch.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
And we never save time for lunch.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
We allocate time for rest.

55:08.000 --> 55:14.000
We allocate time to have a full breakfast, dinner.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
We allocate full time for sleep.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
Otherwise, in a month or two, we will have a situation

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
in which we will not be able to work.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
And finally, the use of time gaps.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
What is it about?

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
We often have to wait for something, spend time on the road.

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
We try to make sure that this time does not go to waste.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
We keep some book with us.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
If the time we spend on the road allows,

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
let's say we drive a car and drive not by ourselves,

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
we can work on a computer, on a laptop.

56:00.000 --> 56:06.000
If we are not allowed, we can just listen to music.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
We can listen to audio books.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
By the way, it is very fashionable now.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
Everyone collects audio books, exchanges audio books, discusses them.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
In addition, now very fashionable microphones.

56:19.000 --> 56:25.000
We record our ideas when we do not have the opportunity

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
to record something on a paper carrier.

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
Something came to our mind, we write it on a recorder.

56:34.000 --> 56:42.000
And after that, we transfer all this to paper or electronic view.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
In fact, it is a very useful thing.

56:46.000 --> 56:54.000
So, we are summing up the block of time and time absorbers.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Next slide.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
We want to manage, we measure.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
We get an objective picture and no revolutions,

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
in no case do not radically change your life.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
And the third, when we track the indicators in the dynamics,

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
they improve themselves.

57:15.000 --> 57:21.000
So, we have finished a very important block of time.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
And now we are starting to an even more important plot.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
Planning our time.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
Our next plot is planning.

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
But very often we associate planning with something tough.

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
Nine hours of meetings, 10 hours of negotiations,

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
11 hours of some kind of meeting.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.000
We will approach the problem of planning our time a little differently.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
From the point of view of how to perform the task in the optimal time for it.

58:00.000 --> 58:09.000
And first of all, we will talk about the role of His Majesty the Case.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
Tell me, please, were there any situations in your life,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
completely random,

58:20.000 --> 58:26.000
thanks to which some changes occurred in your work,

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
in your personal life, in your development?

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
Something happened, for sure.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Of course.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
The role of the case in the life of each of us is colossal.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
And when we conduct trainings in companies,

58:44.000 --> 58:50.000
listeners sometimes tell absolutely amazing situations.

58:51.000 --> 58:58.000
For example, a person has always dreamed of being a pediatrician.

58:58.000 --> 59:05.000
And now, the last holidays before the choice of specialization.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
A person is already studying at a medical institute.

59:08.000 --> 59:16.000
And now he returns to the institute after the holidays, and, oh, horror, he is late for the train.

59:16.000 --> 59:26.000
He changes the ticket, finds himself in another train, and finds himself in a compartment with a famous forensic medical expert.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
They talked all the way.

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
A person comes to Moscow and writes a statement for a forensic medical examination.

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
He is told, how is it possible? You are cutting off your way to medical practice.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
You can no longer be a doctor.

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
And the person says, no, no, this is exactly the case of my life.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
And it really turns out to be the case of his life.

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
We see a successful, well-off person, a bright personality.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It turns out that this is an amazing community of these people, as it really happens.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
The role of the case is really impossible to overestimate in our life.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It is great, it is colossal.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Meanwhile, please look at the slide.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
We are all trying to plan everything hard.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And if we, pay attention to the next slide,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
turn to the ancient Greeks,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
we will see two concepts of time.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Not only the concept of chronos, which we are used to.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
This is linear, measurable, astronomical time.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
That's it.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
At 5 p.m. presentation, at 6 p.m. some solemn part,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
at 7 p.m. leaving work, and so on.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
It was very hard.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
But they had a different concept of time.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The concept of chiros.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:16.000
This is not a linear time or favorable moment to perform a particular task.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000
What chiros are seen in our everyday life, everyday work?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It turns out that there are quite classic chiros,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.000
or classic contexts that we miss in our work.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
What is it?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
These are contexts tied to some places.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
For example, when I'm in a bank, don't forget the first, second, third.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
When I'm on a business trip, don't forget the first, second, third.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
What can I say?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Each of us goes to a store,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and very often we meet with such a situation.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
A phone call.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
You will pass by the store, don't forget to buy bread.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
This is the very context planning.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
There are contexts tied to people, or groups of people.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000
When I meet with Ivan Ivanovich, don't forget the first, second, third.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.000
When I'm at a meeting, don't forget to say about the first, second, third.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Finally, there are contexts like circumstances.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
For example, these are internal circumstances.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
This is my resource state.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:55.000
This is my resource state when I feel exhausted.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
At this moment I can just sit and say to myself,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
how tired I am.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:12.000
And I can plan some things that work to restore my balance and my own rest.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And finally, these are external circumstances.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
When finally some law will come out, some situation.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
When such and such order will come, such and such instruction, and so on.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
So let's summarize the typical Kairos.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Attention to the next slide.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Kairos is a place in a bank, in a car service, in a branch, on a business trip, somewhere else.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Kairos is a person or a group of people.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:54.000
When a client calls, don't forget to talk to him about this, that, and that.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
You may say, wait a minute, you can call him yourself.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Aha, maybe this is a question of a very serious policy.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Not to show interest to yourself, but to wait for the right moment,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.000
when a person will contact you, and here, by the way, to tell him what we need.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Internal circumstances.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.000
During the inspiration surge, for example, Alexander Pushkin had a Kairos,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
which was called the Echidna mood.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
As you know, he was often described with all sorts of nasty things.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:42.000
He had a crystal vase, in which he cut out, put notes, and threw them into this crystal vase.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And when he had a Kairos, the Echidna mood, he took out some Easter egg

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and wrote a nasty, flimsy epigram on it.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It was beautiful.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And finally, external circumstances.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
A famous Kairos.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
When the boss is in a good mood.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Don't forget to solve these questions.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
When, finally, some law comes, some position.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000
What is context planning and how to plan luck?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
How to plan Kairos?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
So, if the context or Kairos is a set of conditions favorable for performing any task.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
All this is presented to you on the next slide.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Then context planning is a planning technique, which consists of

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
1. Identification of typical personal Kairos.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
What Kairos do you have?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:50.000
2. Establishing the appropriate lists of tasks associated with these Kairos.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:59.000
3. Viewing these lists when approaching certain Kairos.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Let's see how context planning is carried out.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Attention to the next slide.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It presents context planning in a diary.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So, the first technique is separate sections on typical contexts.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You take your diary.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You select separate sections of this diary.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Client A, Client B, Client C, Project A, Project B, Project C.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And you write all the questions that relate to this client or this project.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Next.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
The second technique is stickers for flexible tasks.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
What is it?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You agreed to call someone at the end of the month.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
In general, I must say that this is an extremely unsuccessful formulation.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Because the end of the month is a very conditional concept.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
For one, the end of the month is 30th and 31st.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Another means that the 25th is already the end of the month.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Then it is always not very successful.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
When we call, there is always a problem.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And I thought you would call.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And so on.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So, what can we do in this case?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
We can write down on the 25th to call Ivan Ivanovich.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
We can write it down.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
The 25th has come. We call Ivan Ivanovich.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
We find out that he is on a business trip.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
We find out that he will come in three days.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
What should we do?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
First.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
We try to remember that we need to call Ivan Ivanovich in three days.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Extremely unsuccessful.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It is exactly after the 30th that we will definitely forget about it.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
The second option.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
We rewrite this record to the 28th.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Better.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Although we spent a certain amount of time on this.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
On the 28th, we call Ivan Ivanovich.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And we are told that he will not be there today.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
He drove in there in the morning for five minutes and left today with the ends.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
What should we do?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Rewrite to tomorrow?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And how long should we rewrite from one page to another?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Stickers in this regard.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
A much more convenient tool.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
We paste them on the corresponding page of the diary.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
If this task has passed to another day.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
It takes us a split second to paste this sticker.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:47.000
In addition, the sticker has the ability to signal to us that we need to solve a particular task.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And finally, the third technique.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
It is called a tab with contextual tasks.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:06.000
In the former Soviet Union, maybe some of you have met such a tool called a perfocard.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It was very popular in computing centers, programmers, and developers.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
This is a dense cardboard of a small format.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:26.000
On it, as a rule, in addition to its main application, it was very convenient to write down, mark and store something.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:36.000
So, this is a sheet of dense cardboard, thin, on which you write down a list of your tasks.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And this sheet is posted on one page of your diary to another.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:55.000
For example, during lunch, you can meet with Ivanov and Petrov and talk to them about this and that.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:06.000
You can write such a task on a perfocard and take it with you when you go to lunch.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:15.000
So, naturally, you don't have to carry a diary with you, don't have to look at what tasks you have tied to lunchtime, and so on.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
This is what concerns the tab with contextual tasks.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
But these are personal contextual planning techniques.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Yes, you can, of course, use the context planning technique on Outlook.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:51.000
In order to actually use this technique, you should only pull up the right edge of the screen in the calendar, and you will see another field.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's called the task field.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And you can create the necessary categories on this task field that correspond to your context.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The category is people, the category is clients, the category is business, the category is business trip, and so on.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:29.000
There is a need to implement this context planning for your team, for your department, department, company as a whole.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Context planning boards are very convenient for this.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Please look at the next slide.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:52.000
These boards show completely real ways of context planning that work in various organizations.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The left slide shows what works in one large company in St. Petersburg.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:05.000
The right one shows the Moscow educational organization.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So, please look at the left example of the context planning board.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:28.000
The board shows the performers who perform tasks within specific projects, and the lines show the projects.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:39.000
At the intersection, there are stickers with the tasks that are solved by the performers within the projects.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Please note that we have a full overview of the tasks that are solved within the projects.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Secondly, it is very convenient for us to adjust.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:01.000
For example, Ivanov is preparing a presentation, and Petrov is preparing to participate in the exhibition.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Seeing all this, Petrov can easily arrange Ivanov's presentation as his resource for participating in the exhibition.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Please look at the example on the right.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:29.000
So, the Moscow educational organization spends a lot of time communicating with various educational bodies.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000
The courier service has long been exhausted by the need to transport documents back and forth.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So, what have people come up with?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000
The context planning board is designed for the ministries, departments, and committees

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:57.000
that need to go to either deliver documents or discuss certain issues.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:10.000
The announcement is made on March 12th, at the same time, that Ivanov should be in the 32nd office of the ministry.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.000
People who pass by, stick their stickers,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and say, please, come in and take the documents for Petrov, who is in the next office.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Or, please, if you are in the ministry, come to office 32 and take the necessary documents or documents for me.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Thus, we use the opportunities that open up to us as a result of someone else's performance of their own tasks.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
In fact, this is not uncommon in companies.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:06.000
For example, one company is practicing the allocation of a car for the needs of employees,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
and the schedule of this car is laid out in the outlook.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:23.000
You can look at the route of this car, you can get into this route in order to hand over the documents or just go yourself.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:34.000
If this route is not suitable for you, you can simply book a free time for your needs.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Or another company has a problem with transferring documents to the accounting office,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
it takes a long time to move there, and so on.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:55.000
They have a schedule, and people put their documents in a certain place that must be transferred to the accounting office.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
A person for whom this task is extremely relevant and he needs to solve it as soon as possible,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
takes the entire package of documents and brings it to the accounting office.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Thus, the opportunities and resources of someone else are used.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And now we will take our first step towards creating our personal context planning system.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:35.000
To do this, please open the workbooks on page 7, and our task is now to define our old and new contexts.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So, the task is to identify our typical personal contexts,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
we need to formulate tasks related to these contexts,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and finally, we need to determine ways of organizing context planning.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Let's look at the example presented.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Very often in our practice, I hope it's not only in my practice, but also in our practice,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
there is a situation when we meet someone and say,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I wanted to discuss something with you, but now I forgot.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Okay, I'll call you back.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It happens, doesn't it?

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
It happened to me, especially when I met my boss.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
He is an extremely busy person,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and when he called me to clarify some of his questions,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I solved these questions, and after that I would like to take this moment

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
and solve the questions that arose with me to my boss.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But unfortunately, at this very moment, all these questions were popping out of my head.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
What did I come up with for this topic?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I created a folder on which I wrote,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Chef, any questions that arose with me to my boss,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I always recorded on paper, and this sheet of paper was safely put in this folder and forgot about it.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
If I had any non-urgent documents requiring his signature,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I grouped these documents, wrote a kind of accompanying document,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
and also put them in the folder.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So let's see what we got as a result.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The first line, the context, when will I be able to talk to the director.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The associated tasks.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I need to get a signature on the documents,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I need to agree on the information in the catalog,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
and finally, I need to approve the conference program.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
How is the context planning organized?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
A checklist of questions in the folder.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Pay attention to what is indicated in the brackets with the solution options.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
We practice not open questions to the management,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
but we practice questions with ready-made solution options.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:33.000
If you are the manager, then adjust your subordinates.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000
It works the same way, save your time and grow yourself.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And finally, a list of documents for signature and approval.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Now, at the moment when my manager has a question for me,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I, like Zhvonetsky, have a folder with all the questions,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
and I rush to my manager.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Having found out all the questions that he has,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I ask him a question, and now you have a little time left.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Having received an affirmative answer, I open my priceless folder

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
and find out all the questions I have.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And now, please fill in the table that you have at the bottom.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
So, the first line is what you have already taken into account

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
when planning your business.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Perhaps you already had a context, your client, your customer,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
your special object,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000
and you grouped all the questions in relation to this object,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
made a list of these questions,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.000
and when meeting this object, you went straight to the list

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
and found out all the questions you had.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.000
If this was the case, please write down how you took this into account

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
when planning, what the tasks were,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
and how the context planning was organized.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Perhaps with the help of separate sections in the diary,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
perhaps with the help of a separate folder on the computer,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:36.000
perhaps with the help of some other section in Outlook,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
perhaps with the help of stickers, and so on.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And then, please fill in the bottom line of the table.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000
This is the context that you did not take into account when planning,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
but which you have already decided to take into account.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So, please write down this context,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.000
write down the tasks and how you will organize the context planning.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Please pause now, fill in this table,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
and be sure to come back to us. Thank you.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So, you filled in the table,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
and now we are starting to learn a new technique,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
the long-term planning technique.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Please look at the next slide.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
How do we plan for a long period of time?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
We make a plan for a month, a plan for a quarter,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
a plan for six months, a plan for a year.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
All of this is very strict.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
We offer another technique,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
the long-term planning technique,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.000
which is based not on the rules of a strict list of tasks

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:10.000
but on a strict rule of moving tasks from one accumulator to another.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
So, look, please.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
We have three accumulators with you.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
The accumulator for the day, where you have a unit,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000
the accumulator for the week, where you have a seven,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:33.000
and the accumulator for the year, where you have 365.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
So, once a week,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
you look through the list of your annual tasks,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
what you planned for the year.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And what you have matured to do next week,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.000
you move to the list of tasks for the week.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Look at the convenience of this technique.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:11.000
We do not forget about the tasks that we have planned even for the next six months.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Sometimes it happens that we have a very convenient moment right now

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
to solve a task that is not in our plan right now.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
For example, we want to lobby a project,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and we have planned this task for the next six months.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And suddenly, right now, we have a very good moment.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
We are holding a conference,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
we have VIPs here, everyone is present.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
We have the largest business representatives here,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
officials are here,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:57.000
and it is very convenient for us to arrange some kind of express negotiations here on the topic we need.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
But we forgot about this task.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
It is not in front of our eyes,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
it is planned for some long period of time,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
and we just do not use a very successful opportunity to solve this task right now.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
In this case, we do not forget about anything,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.000
because we monitor our annual tasks once a week.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
In addition, we do not need intermediate information carriers.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Our plan for the month, our plan for the quarter, our plan for the half-year,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.000
because all these tasks are concentrated in our annual information carrier.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Next, please look, once a day we monitor the task list for a week.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000
What we have matured to be performed the next day,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
we move to the task list for the day.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Thus, again, we do not forget anything,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and at the same time we adapt quite flexibly to the circumstances that are created around us.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Thus, we manage the circumstances,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and we manage our own planning, planning and organization of our time in these proposed circumstances.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Let's look at the next slide.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:40.000
This is a planning board that is implemented in a large company.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Please look, here are our plans for the day, plans for the week and plans for the month.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Please note, here is the planning for the month, the third line,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
and the pillars of the performers who carry out these tasks.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And at the intersection, tasks that are recorded on stickers.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Unfortunately, this is not reflected on the slide,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
but in fact, in this company, above each name,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000
an envelope is also attached, in which tasks are added,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
that is, already used stickers.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And thus, having completed the task that we planned for the day,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
we just remove this sticker and move it to the envelope,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
and having looked through the list of our tasks for the week,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:56.000
we take the one that is most relevant and most important for us to perform the next day,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:06.000
and just in a matter of seconds we glue it to the board in this section of tasks for the day.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
The same thing happens with the month.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Please note the very interesting result of the work.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
After a month, all these envelopes are emptied,

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:29.000
and a meeting takes place where people sum up the tasks completed in a month.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.000
The most interesting thing is that the person who has completed the most tasks receives a day off.
