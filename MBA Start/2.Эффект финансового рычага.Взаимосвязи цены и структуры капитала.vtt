00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
We have to understand how capital cost and structure are connected with investment decisions of the company

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Here is a simple example from practice

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
The end of 90s, a recent story

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Kabalka-Energo, Kabardino-Balkaria energy system

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
which was always considered to be energy-deficient

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
and was supplied with its own energy resources, only 5%

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
and was supplied mainly from the Stara Plata region

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
decided to raise the level of its energy independence

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
and build a power plant on a small mountain river

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
The power was not great, but the time period was difficult

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Remember, it was after the default, and the capital cost on the Russian market was very high

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
And yet they decided to take this step

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
How was this investment decision connected with capital cost and structure?

01:11.000 --> 01:24.000
No investment decision, especially such a large-scale one, is possible without the participation of the company's own capital

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Kabalka-Energo offered 20% of the world's capital, not less than 20%

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Because the country's interest should be clearly confirmed

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
This can be done only by financing

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
20% of the capital was allocated for the implementation of this project

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
The rest, 80%, had to be found on the market

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
One of the Austrian banks offered to finance this investment project

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Under certain conditions

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
And here is the question

02:02.000 --> 02:14.000
How to tie the return of this project with the cost of money, including internal financing and loan money?

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Everyone understood that the return of the project is very high

02:18.000 --> 02:28.000
It is simply impossible, because the energy resources of the river were weak, and therefore it is simply impossible to build a large power plant

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
There was a hope to build it quickly and to implement all three blocks as it was designed

02:37.000 --> 02:46.000
I had to delve into the fate of this scheme of financing this project

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
Simply because Kabalka-Energo borrowed a huge amount of money from the Institute of Hydroprojects

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
They were the designers, and I was just financing the project

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
And in order to repay the debts of the company, I had to participate in the development of the proposal

03:06.000 --> 03:16.000
How to compare the return of the project with the source of financing, find additional money, repay the debts and implement the power plant?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
The project was planned for three years

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
A few years passed, and I accidentally saw a person who had a relationship with those places

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
The money was found then

03:29.000 --> 03:40.000
Under the guarantee of the Kabardino-Balkaria government, the bank agreed to allocate the required amount of loan money

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
However, an additional guarantee from the Russian State-Owned Enterprises was required

03:45.000 --> 03:54.000
But due to the fact that it was a structural division of the holding, there were no problems with that guarantee

03:54.000 --> 04:10.000
But the whole thing is, and this should be taken into account, how the tranches of the loan money will be distributed

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
One Western bank will never give the allocated amount of money at once

04:16.000 --> 04:29.000
It will be distributed quarterly, or even monthly, and the money will be transferred gradually, while simultaneously controlling how it will be used

04:29.000 --> 04:38.000
Five or six years after the financing scheme worked, I received information

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
The first block was introduced on time, but there were only three

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
When the financing of the second block began, one tranche was used for a wrong purpose, it was simply stolen

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
This was very alarming for the bankers

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
The tranches went bankrupt, the price of capital changed dramatically

04:57.000 --> 05:08.000
The return on investment began to lag behind the cost of loan resources, and the construction of the new block was frozen

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
So, only one block out of three still works

05:12.000 --> 05:21.000
Here is the link between the price of capital and investment decisions, for which we allocate additional capital

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
What does the financial lever do in this case?

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
A very popular expression is the financial risk meter

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
We talked about business risk, but there is also financial risk, which is related to the increase in debt financing

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
This financial lever is manifested in the effect of the financial lever

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
It is very easy to understand its meaning in a schematic form

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Pay attention to this slide

05:52.000 --> 06:05.000
If you look at the right side of the picture, you will see that the element of the financial lever is the shoulder

06:05.000 --> 06:16.000
The shoulder of the lever consists of two elements, the capital itself and the loan capital

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
The capital itself is always small, because you can't make a lot of money, it takes a lot of time

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
You can make money quickly and in large quantities

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
The shoulder of the lever, that is, the ratio of the loan to the capital, can be increased very quickly

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
By increasing the pressure of the lever, I raise a large amount of assets

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Because we borrow money to increase the additional capacity

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
From here, the turnover increases, the income increases, and the business earns

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
In ideal conditions, this scheme works flawlessly, so the whole world uses it

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
Pay attention to this, there is another mysterious element in this scheme, the differential

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
The lever is not directly transferred to the assets, but through the differential

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
It is this differential that determines the level of financial risk in a specific expression

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
Its meaning, how it works, and the efficiency of the financing scheme

07:27.000 --> 07:38.000
What happens here? By acquiring the necessary amount of assets through additional borrowing of money from the market

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
I want these assets to be transformed into turnover

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
A large amount of adequate turnover, if the rate of asset growth as a result of additional financing increased by 5%

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
It is necessary for an entrepreneur to have at least 5% rate of growth

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
The ratio of the rate of growth of the turnover and assets is one of the patterns of effective financing

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
If you pay attention, there are certain books, where the judgment of the efficiency of the business

08:13.000 --> 08:23.000
The rate of growth of the income should be equal to the rate of growth of the turnover

08:23.000 --> 08:36.000
This is the ideal, when the signs are always in one direction

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
It is the highest success of any business, but it is very difficult to support it

08:43.000 --> 08:56.000
The difficulty is how to maintain the differential in the right framework during such a long-term business

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Let's see how it works

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Look at this slide, the relationship between the structure and the value of the capital

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
How the risks are manifested as the structure of financing changes

09:09.000 --> 09:22.000
If I take a graph, I will put a net profit on the vertical, and a profit on the horizontal, up to the interest rate

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
It is often called a net profit, and it is from it that a net profit is formed

09:28.000 --> 09:44.000
The financial risk is how successfully I can transform the net profit into a net profit

09:44.000 --> 09:53.000
In the end, everyone is interested in the net profit, what will remain of the net profit of a particular business

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
The risk of this transformation is the nature of the financial risk

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
Pay attention to this diagram, there are three curves in these coordinates

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
The first curve is that there are no mutual funds, the value of the loan is zero

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
That is, the financing of this business is done by means of its own funds

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
The second curve is that the ratio of mutual funds and own funds is one, that is, 50 to 50

10:24.000 --> 10:31.000
We talked about this point in the judgments about the level of financial dependence

10:31.000 --> 10:40.000
It is shifted to the right, but since I am forming a structure of capital for the same amount of net profit

10:40.000 --> 10:52.000
These two curves intersect at one point, because I put one and the same segment horizontally

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Expressed in profit to pay interest and tax

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
The third curve is even steeper, here the ratio of mutual funds and own funds is two

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
Pay attention to the next vertical line, the sharpening point of the break

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
This is the planned profit, I decided to increase the profit by 50%

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
For this I need to earn the source of this profit, that is, the profit to pay interest and tax

11:24.000 --> 11:33.000
I put this source on the horizontal axis, draw a line vertically to cross all three lines

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
And I find that the maximum net profit is obtained if the ratio of mutual funds and own funds is two

11:41.000 --> 11:50.000
But it is clear that there is no net profit in the net profit, so the risk is much higher

11:50.000 --> 12:01.000
This scheme is instructive in that it must be looked at immediately, and before the breaking point, and after

12:01.000 --> 12:12.000
Before the breaking point, and the horizontal line on which this point is located, the economic profitability is equal to the average rate of interest

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
This is the original judgment

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
If my business is developing from the very beginning

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
And we are talking about choosing a financing structure before the breaking point

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
Then, of course, the preference should be given exclusively to your own financing

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
If you remember the table of factors, we said that in the initial period, the priority should be given to your own financing

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Here is a graphical confirmation

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
The curve when the mutual funds are equal to zero, below the breaking point, above the rest

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
This means that this is a preferable way of financing

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
And after the breaking point, everything is exactly the opposite

12:56.000 --> 13:07.000
The greatest return is possible with a huge financial lever, when the mutual funds are equal to two

13:07.000 --> 13:17.000
How to make sure that the financial lever is not bent, that is, the financial lever should be left in such a position

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
So as not to violate the financial balance of this business

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Often people say that the financial lever is a sharp weapon

13:26.000 --> 13:35.000
They say that the weak are weaker, stronger and stronger because of the use of the lever

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
This is how important it is for a financier to structure the factors

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
Here are the priorities at the expense of their own sources, here are the priorities at the expense of debt financing

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Exactly for the situation, at any time, for their business, they have laid out the factors

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
And from here, the sharpness of this weapon will be immediately neutralized

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Why is the strong becoming even stronger?

14:01.000 --> 14:14.000
If the financial dependence is small, I build up the financial lever, I increase the effort, increase the power, increase the turnover, and the return from increased power, and the business grows

14:14.000 --> 14:25.000
On the contrary, if the business is weak, by increasing the pressure of the financial lever, I can simply destroy the business

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Why? Look at what the financial lever differential expresses

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
Here is a simple formula, the differential is equal to 1 minus the tax rate, but there is a tax return rate

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
Multiplied by the economic profitability minus the average rate of interest

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
Remember the slide, the formula for the sufficiency of one's own capital

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
The other abbreviation expresses the same thing

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
You see how often this value in brackets is repeated when making financial decisions of different meanings

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
The financial lever's shoulder is the relationship of the borrower to the owner

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
What happens, how does the differential work?

15:07.000 --> 15:22.000
When trying to increase the impact of the financial lever by increasing the debt financing, the sign of the differential can change to the opposite

15:22.000 --> 15:34.000
So, the strong becomes even stronger, when the sign of the differential is positive, the business becomes even stronger

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
The weak becomes even weaker, when the sign of the differential is positive

15:41.000 --> 15:53.000
The creditor and any institution that gave you money for investment will be attentive to your financial accountability

15:53.000 --> 16:06.000
As soon as they notice that the rate of growth of the turnover is behind the rate of growth of the assets, they will immediately understand that you have entered the financial risk

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
They will immediately take all measures to increase the value of the loan, they will insure their risks

16:14.000 --> 16:22.000
The value of the loan is increasing, it is crossing the economic profitability line, the value in brackets is negative

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
If you continue to work in this capital structure, the business will die

16:28.000 --> 16:38.000
Therefore, all attention should be directed to the careful monitoring of the dynamics of these parameters

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
The rate of growth of the assets, the rate of growth of the turnover

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
If you see that the rate of growth of the turnover is behind, and you are the first to see it, because you are the authors of financial accountability

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
You should immediately say that you can't borrow anymore, because the financial lever will work against you

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
This is the main thing that should be monitored by the financier in the conditions of debt financing

17:00.000 --> 17:08.000
Then the financial lever will be good for you, you will earn additional profits, and the owners will be satisfied

17:08.000 --> 17:18.000
In practice, a universal formula is used, it is called the financial lever coefficient

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
The profitability of the assets is equal to the profitability of the assets, or economic profitability

17:23.000 --> 17:32.000
Plus d to c is the financial lever shoulder, r to a minus i is the financial lever differential

17:32.000 --> 17:41.000
The only thing to keep in mind is the profitability of the assets and the value of the debt with the tax shield

17:41.000 --> 17:50.000
That is, 1 minus the tax rate for the profit, and for the Russian conditions, 1 minus 0, 24, with the tax rate of 24%

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
That is, each component of this formula is multiplied by 0.76

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
The more you get, the more you get.

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
It is immediately clear from this formula under what conditions the profitability of the capital is higher than the profitability of the assets

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
Only if the value is positive, that is, the differential is positive

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
Then the owners will be satisfied with such a financial lever

18:22.000 --> 18:32.000
And vice versa, as soon as the profitability of the assets is equal to the value of the loan, the value in the bracket is 0

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
The profitability of the capital is equal to the profitability of the assets

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
This is a signal from the financing structure, such a company needs to be quickly understood, the structure of the capital needs to be optimized

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
There are a lot of questions when forming the structure of the capital

18:49.000 --> 19:00.000
When we say, is there an equivalence condition when the end result of the business is approximately the same

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Both when using your own financing and when using the financing of the debt

19:05.000 --> 19:15.000
That is, to take into account such a structure of capital, which is of course profitable, but more often than not expresses a net profit for one share

19:15.000 --> 19:23.000
It was equal to the various structures of capital

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
This is the original idea of the equivalence of the value of the capital

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
The equivalence is understood in two senses

19:33.000 --> 19:40.000
The first sense is that the debt can be short or long

19:40.000 --> 19:56.000
So, by varying the various structures of the debt, you can also choose a state when the company's financial profit is achieved with the various contents of the debt structure

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Where does this problem arise from?

19:59.000 --> 20:10.000
It's very simple, everyone understands that the longer the period of debt financing, the more risks the creditor takes on himself

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
And everyone understands that there is no constant 100% rates

20:15.000 --> 20:27.000
And these risks, when converted into profitability, the cost of a long-term debt is usually higher than the cost of short-term loans

20:28.000 --> 20:45.000
It would seem that in order to get the maximum profit, you need to use short-term financing

20:45.000 --> 20:59.000
But here the reaction to profitability is ambiguous, it cannot be released from the view of how the company's liquidity is doing

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
Short-term loans should be returned more often

21:03.000 --> 21:15.000
Due to the fact that the rate is not constant, it is possible to reduce interest rates or increase them

21:16.000 --> 21:35.000
But the most difficult thing in managing short-term financing is that the more often you have to return the loan money, the more problems arise in choosing the means to do it

21:35.000 --> 21:44.000
You always need to save up the reserves, and if the rate of repayment of the loan is active, then this problem is constant

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
It is difficult to track liquidity, that is, the state of payment is very difficult

21:50.000 --> 22:01.000
And so there is a certain balance between the average level of profitability that I have for this company and the level of liquidity

22:01.000 --> 22:17.000
This balance determines how many long-term and short-term debts are needed to manage liquidity and to make the profitability acceptable

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
The problem of equivalence of capital and debt can be easily expressed formally

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Pay attention to this slide

22:25.000 --> 22:47.000
Pure profit is equal to the profit before the payment of taxes, e, minus the sum of interest on the debt, multiplied by 1-t, which is the tax shield for the profit

22:47.000 --> 23:00.000
Minus the sum of dividends on the pre-agreed shares, and divided by the number of ordinary shares in circulation

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
How can I calculate the equivalence of various schemes of financing for different capital structures?

23:07.000 --> 23:18.000
I take the right part of the formula and for different capital structures I equate these values, that is, I use the right part twice

23:18.000 --> 23:30.000
The first time I use the right part of the formula to formulate the structure taking into account the debt, the second time taking into account my own capital

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
And I solve the equation of e. What do I find?

23:35.000 --> 23:47.000
I find the balance between the profit before the payment of interest and taxes, which provides the same pure profit on shares for different financial structures

23:47.000 --> 23:55.000
I find the balance, and then I start to formulate the debt structure from this optimal value

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
And that's the whole task of finding the equivalence states

24:01.000 --> 24:09.000
Where are these judgments important when making investments?

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
We attract money to let it grow, right?

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
Therefore, all judgments on the structure and value of capital are important from the point of view of investment

24:22.000 --> 24:32.000
In order to solve this problem in practice, there are three models of capital value in science

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
The first is the actual or current value

24:35.000 --> 24:45.000
If I take the balance of any company, I will calculate the value of my own capital on the right side

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
I calculate the value of debt financing, which is the actual structure of capital

24:51.000 --> 25:03.000
I substitute the values of the current and current components in the formula of average expenses for capital and get the actual value of capital today

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
The next is the target value of capital

25:07.000 --> 25:21.000
If I use the data on the balance, which characterizes the actual state of capital, as a basis for making the next investment decision

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
I decided to increase the turnover by 20%, and I need additional sources of financing

25:26.000 --> 25:35.000
If I add this additional demand to the existing structure of capital, I will get the target value of capital

25:36.000 --> 25:45.000
The third and most important model is the limit value of capital

25:45.000 --> 25:55.000
It plays a fundamental role in the final assessment of the success or acceptance of investment decisions

25:55.000 --> 26:08.000
The limit value of capital is the maximum value of the additional capital, which is not enough for the company to meet the required income standards

26:08.000 --> 26:17.000
We said that every investor who provides me with financing has an idea of what I will get from it

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
This is the understanding of the required income standards

26:21.000 --> 26:36.000
If I attract additional money to the market within certain limits, and the value does not change, and I exceed these limits, which are the additional units

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
The price will be different immediately

26:41.000 --> 26:49.000
If the price exceeds the required income standard, then it is simply impossible to use this source of financing

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
Why does science use the term limit value of capital?

26:55.000 --> 27:09.000
This understanding is due to the fact that capital is a business factor, just like labor factor

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
What is the limit value of labor resources?

27:15.000 --> 27:26.000
The value of each additional employee on the market, and here each additional investment ruble

27:26.000 --> 27:39.000
This understanding from the point of view of production factors makes this term easy to understand for people who practice it

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
The initial parcels that are necessary for calculating the limit value of capital

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
We discussed the methods of capital optimization

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
The reaction of investors and creditors to the change in the structure of capital is not instantaneous

27:56.000 --> 28:11.000
It will be necessary, but it will take some time before investors and creditors will appreciate the return on investment

28:11.000 --> 28:21.000
So, at a certain time interval, we can attract additional sources of financing without changing their value

28:21.000 --> 28:32.000
This is the first point. Any source of financing, whether external or internal, has a certain limit on the volume at an unchanged value

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
This is the first condition for calculating the limit value of capital

28:37.000 --> 28:50.000
The second condition makes me look for the exact limits outside the range of money attraction

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
Maybe money attraction will be more expensive, but I am ready to use such a source

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
But we have to calculate the transition from one value to another

29:02.000 --> 29:16.000
And finally, we have to realize that with certain parameters of data interconnection, the financing plan can change the value of financing so much

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
That it will lead to the destruction of the investment project and even the financial balance of the business

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
And this is what happened with the construction of the Ausha Gershkoi GS

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
How to solve this problem? How to find these intervals when the value of capital does not change?

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
How to find the value of capital within these limits?

29:39.000 --> 29:48.000
There has been a problem of interconnection of capital and the acceptance of investment projects since ancient times

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
Pay attention to this slide. There are 6 steps in the algorithm

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
The problem is solved in a way that is understandable to any practitioner of the financial language

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Everything immediately falls into place

30:03.000 --> 30:10.000
The first step is to determine the size, cost and the specific weight of each source of financing for the projects

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
No matter how many there are. 2, 3, maybe 1

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
The second step is to determine the parameters of the budget of the investment

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
What are the parameters of the budget of the investment?

30:24.000 --> 30:34.000
When you discussed the investment decision in the previous sessions, you said that each project has an internal profitability

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
And the volume of capital investments that it requires for its implementation

30:38.000 --> 30:45.000
These two parameters represent the parameters of the budget of the investment

30:45.000 --> 30:54.000
I have to make a separate table with these parameters and reflect the entire portfolio of investment projects in this table

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
The third step is to calculate the parameter of critical points

31:00.000 --> 31:08.000
I have to calculate the points where the value of the capital ends and the jump occurs

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
It is considered very simple

31:10.000 --> 31:21.000
The parameter of the critical point is equal to the value of the source of financing that is most available to me divided by its specific weight

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
It will be as it will be

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Let's say I have an available source of financing of 4 million dollars

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
Its specific weight is 50%

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
4 divided by 0.5 is 8

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
This is the limit within which the value of this source of financing will be unchanged

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
If I attract more, the structure of the capital will change the value

31:45.000 --> 31:51.000
And this will be my idea of this critical point

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
The point of the break-in of capital spending

31:55.000 --> 32:04.000
When we have defined the volume limits of financing at the unchanged value

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
Now we have to calculate the average cost of capital spending according to the structure of the target financing

32:11.000 --> 32:24.000
I calculate the cost of financing within these limits

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
The next step is to build two graphs

32:28.000 --> 32:35.000
The first graph is the limit of capital spending according to the parameters of the critical points

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
And the volume of the capital attracted

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
And the average cost of capital spending within these critical points

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
This is the first parameter for the graph

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
I will build this graph in the coordinates of the average cost of capital spending

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Vertically and horizontally, the volume of financing

32:59.000 --> 33:07.000
When the financing volume at the unchanged value is over

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
You will immediately see a jump on the graph

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
The cost of financing increases and the curve goes up

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
The second graph is the graph of investment opportunities

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
I have made a table for the capital budget

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
There will be only two parameters

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
The volume of capital investments for each project and the internal norm of profitability

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Vertically, I build the graph again

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
The profitability of projects is vertical

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
Horizontally, the volume of capital investments that are necessary for their implementation

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Then I put one graph on another

33:45.000 --> 33:55.000
I draw conclusions about the acceptance of this financing scheme for investment projects

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Here is a concrete example

33:58.000 --> 34:06.000
Mos Isolator is my company, where I worked as a factory director in Moscow for three years

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
It has a parameter of the investment budget

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
This is a very specific data

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
We agreed on two parameters for each project

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Project A, the volume of capital investments is $2 million

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
The profitability of the project is 13%

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
Project B, the volume of capital investments is 3%

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
The profitability is 15%

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
This is the most attractive profitability of the project

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Project 3, the volume of capital investments is 2.9%

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
I can't say that I have to cancel the last project

34:39.000 --> 34:48.000
When you were discussing the investment project, you were probably told that there are projects that the business simply cannot refuse

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
In order to continue it

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
For example, compliance with environmental requirements at the enterprise

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
It is clear that the return, the power of the business does not increase

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
But without solving this problem, you will not be able to work further

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
That's why sometimes you have to implement these projects

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
Here is the parameter of the investment budget

35:13.000 --> 35:20.000
When I understand these data, the question arises

35:20.000 --> 35:31.000
What does the owner of this business need in order to implement all three projects without losing control over them?

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
With different funding structures

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
What does it mean not to lose control?

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
We started with the idea of capital in balance

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
Here is the capital of the property, and on the left is the capital of the function

35:47.000 --> 35:59.000
The capital of the property, which is the passive part of the balance, characterizes the structure of power in this company

35:59.000 --> 36:10.000
By changing the funding structure, attracting additional funding sources on the external market, especially in the part of the property capital

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
Very often, the investor comes with so-called restrictions

36:15.000 --> 36:22.000
They introduce additional restrictions for companies that accept investments

36:22.000 --> 36:32.000
For example, I will provide you with funds for financing the project if you include my person or, according to my recommendations, the board of directors

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
This will definitely affect the structure of power in the company

36:36.000 --> 36:50.000
That's why entrepreneurs try to develop the investment financing scheme in such a way as not to lose control over the company

36:50.000 --> 36:58.000
The easiest way to achieve this is to have a structure of financing, a structure of power over the company

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
Once the structure is formed, it should be distributed further in the conditions of the target capital structure

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
And it should be left the same, for example, 50-50

37:10.000 --> 37:21.000
The owners of the company have dictated that the financing of the projects should be carried out at 50% at the expense of existing sources

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
And 50% at the expense of additional shares

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
Of course, additional shares can destroy the structure of the property

37:29.000 --> 37:44.000
But they are sure that the capital structure will withstand changes without losing control over the owners

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
And the control will be preserved

37:48.000 --> 37:56.000
The company has the opportunity to send a loan of $1.7 million to the financier, that is, available money

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
And we agreed to finance 50% at the expense of additional shares

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Let's look at the company's accounting

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
The modern capital structure is presented in equal parts

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
The property with a return of 16% per year and a long-term currency loan of 8% per year

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
But here we should keep in mind that 8% is an effective rate, and is corrected to the tax shield

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
That is, 1-T, the value in brackets, I have already used it in the calculation

38:25.000 --> 38:36.000
Then the actual capital cost is 0.5, that is, 50% per 8 years, plus 0.5 per 16 years of capital

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
The average cost is 12

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
These are the initial parcels for determining the maximum capital costs

38:43.000 --> 38:56.000
And then we say that to attract money to finance this investment portfolio, we need to attract money with the additional emission of shares

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And then the question arises

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
We have agreed that the theorists still do not give us an exact answer to how much a share costs

39:05.000 --> 39:20.000
Therefore, in the real world, the company rarely takes responsibility for the valuation of the value of the emission of share capital

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Usually, it is attracted by the investment bank

39:22.000 --> 39:32.000
It accumulates a huge amount of information about the company's competitors, analogs, the dynamics of the exchange rate change

39:32.000 --> 39:41.000
And having a huge amount of additional information, it more accurately determines the possible value of the emission

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
But, as you understand, such services are not free

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
I had to conduct two emissions of shares at the same factory

39:49.000 --> 39:57.000
The first was done by myself, primarily emission, transformation of a state enterprise into a private one

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
It is understandable that this emission was formal

40:01.000 --> 40:09.000
The second emission, attracting additional financing for investment projects, required the attraction of consultants

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
Of course, it was not free, it was additional money spending

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
And we agreed on a general approach to the valuation of capital costs

40:16.000 --> 40:28.000
All the financial costs, including the costs for attracting consultants, investment bankers, and the volume of the attractive source

40:28.000 --> 40:39.000
As for the emission of shares, public placement, it is rarely done by a company that is responsible for the implementation of this project

40:39.000 --> 40:48.000
Of course, it attracts specialists, investment companies, or some investment bank

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
And they help the company to place this emission at the right price

40:53.000 --> 41:02.000
They calculate the market opportunities, they live a market life, market agents, and they understand this better

41:02.000 --> 41:09.000
They have a wide clientele, and this is why this work is not done

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
This work on guaranteed placement of the emission was called underwriting in science

41:17.000 --> 41:25.000
The underwriting costs, that is, guaranteed placement, if the guarantee is taken by the investment bank

41:25.000 --> 41:31.000
It was about 10% of the emission volume

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
The cost is quite impressive

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
Investment bankers calculated the situation for this company, and they said that the emission will be 20% per year

41:40.000 --> 41:52.000
Then I put a formula, the average value of capital is 0.5 by 8%, plus the value has not changed for a long time

41:53.000 --> 42:01.000
And 0.5 by 20%, the top emission has a cost of 20%, the average capital cost is 14%

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
And what are the limits I have this cost?

42:05.000 --> 42:18.000
We looked at the formula, the volume of the available source is equal to the volume of the available value, 1.7 million dollars

42:18.000 --> 42:25.000
I divide it by 0.5, 1.7 divided by 0.5, 3.4 million dollars

42:25.000 --> 42:33.000
The value of capital is unchanged in these limits, and it is equal to 14%

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
And then we have to reflect all this on the graph

42:38.000 --> 42:51.000
We agreed that the basic parameter of the investment project is its internal profitability, the internal norm of profitability, IRR

42:51.000 --> 43:02.000
The first project B had a profitability of 15%, and the financing volume, or the volume of the co-position 3, you see the size of the investment

43:02.000 --> 43:12.000
The first segment, from 15 I made a horizontal line to mark 3, and I reflected the parameters of this project

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
The second project had a profitability of 13%, and it required 2 million dollars

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
The next fat curve characterizes the second investment project

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
The third project is unlikely to be realized in these conditions

43:28.000 --> 43:43.000
If the original capital cost was 12%, and it has a return of 9%, it is clear that in such conditions the capital cost will not miss this investment project

43:44.000 --> 43:54.000
The last curve with a return of 9%, financing volume 2, this is the curve of investment opportunities

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
You can apply the limit capital cost curve to this graph

43:59.000 --> 44:07.000
We calculated that the horizontal line is 3.4 million dollars, and the profitability is 14%

44:07.000 --> 44:17.000
The first curve shows the limit capital cost of this company

44:17.000 --> 44:29.000
We agreed that based on the limit capital cost, each additional ruble of investment resources will be more expensive

44:29.000 --> 44:39.000
The curve goes up, and I didn't even count it, it is clear that it will be more expensive, but the meaning of calculations disappears

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
Because I looked at the curve of investment opportunities

44:43.000 --> 44:54.000
All subsequent projects, except for 15%, were below, so they can be realized if the capital cost falls

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
And it is increasing, so the further judgments are meaningless

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
What conclusion can I make from this?

45:01.000 --> 45:09.000
I can take only the first project for the realization, it was under the number B

45:09.000 --> 45:17.000
With a capital investment volume of 3 million, and we have 3.4 million, we have enough money

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
And with profitability 15%, and we have expenses 14%

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
So this is the only acceptable project in this situation

45:27.000 --> 45:37.000
You will find more detailed examples in the material, but the meaning is the same

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
Calculate the parameters of critical points, that is, the volumetric parameters of available financing

45:43.000 --> 45:50.000
Calculate the capital cost for each critical point

45:50.000 --> 45:57.000
No matter how many sources you attract, the further calculation is the same

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
Critical point, volumetric parameters, capital cost

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
The next critical point, capital cost again

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
And then you make conclusions on the parameters of the investment budget

46:10.000 --> 46:20.000
What conclusions do the financial directors make about the theory of capital structure?

46:20.000 --> 46:29.000
The authoritative scientists of the West sometimes say that

46:29.000 --> 46:43.000
It seems that the theory of capital structure is mystical

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
Because each company is unique, the set of factors that determine the structure of capital is different

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
The combinations can be different

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
So science is not able to offer something universal

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
And here is how the practitioners react to this

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
These are the conclusions from the research of the last years

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
The most important factor is financial flexibility

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
That is, maintaining a low level of your debt or financial dependence

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
In order to be prepared for the unforeseen circumstances

47:19.000 --> 47:31.000
Scientists have recently stated that the world has moved into a global economy or post-industrial development

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
These are not empty words, there are very strong and objective grounds for this

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
Post-industrial means that the period of industrial development of the world economy is over

47:40.000 --> 47:48.000
This means that the world has accumulated production capacities that are at least twice as large as the needs of the planet's population

47:48.000 --> 47:58.000
It makes no sense to build new factories, it is only worth turning on the built-up capacity and the world will be overwhelmed with everything necessary

47:59.000 --> 48:11.000
In such conditions, competitive struggle begins to take on special forms

48:11.000 --> 48:21.000
Today, it is said that obtaining additional competitive advantages becomes possible exclusively on the path of innovation

48:21.000 --> 48:30.000
That is, I will accumulate some special knowledge and this will be my guarantee of maintaining competitiveness for the future

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
This is where the risks arise

48:34.000 --> 48:46.000
We have agreed from the very beginning that the more pioneering a project is, the more risks it involves

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
This means that the concern for risks becomes the number one concern

48:50.000 --> 48:58.000
This is why the number one priority of the world's largest financial directors is to maintain financial flexibility

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
I will not have a great financial dependence

49:02.000 --> 49:11.000
The justification for this conclusion should be understood from the following point of view

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
Not only has the world accumulated production capacities, but also capital

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Pay attention to what is happening today

49:20.000 --> 49:33.000
Just 10 years ago, people were saying that the turnover of the physical assets is comparable to the turnover of the financial assets

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
The second turnover is 40 times higher than the first

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Today I have seen the figure of 100 times

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
The world has accumulated not only a huge amount of physical assets, but also financial assets

49:45.000 --> 49:52.000
This circumstance should not be taken into account

49:52.000 --> 50:02.000
If there is a re-accumulation of financial capital, having a small financial dependence on the external environment

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
I always have access to a huge amount of financial resources

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
This is the whole point of flexibility

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
But there is one fundamental contradiction that must always be taken into account

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
What is it?

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
I know for sure that the physical assets are limited

50:20.000 --> 50:29.000
The oil reserves and other resources do not raise the question that they are fundamentally limited

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
The financial resources are not limited

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
This contradiction is expressed in the money expression

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
This contradiction is called fundamental

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
People are afraid of the fundamental limitation of financial resources or capital

50:47.000 --> 50:54.000
Therefore, they are forced to put financial flexibility as the number one priority

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
They say that all fund indexes in Russia have started to fall

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
IMF, IMF and RTS

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
What happened?

51:04.000 --> 51:15.000
Western financiers, and we have only echoes of the crisis that has started in the mortgage market in the United States

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Only echoes

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Western investors have started to withdraw money from our market

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Transfer money to themselves

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
We need to support liquidity there

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
Companies that issued mortgage loans collapse there

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
We immediately felt the liquidity deficit in Russia

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Where did we see it?

51:34.000 --> 51:40.000
One-day loans from 4.5 to 7%

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Just in a few days

51:42.000 --> 51:48.000
This is the problem of liquidity deficit

51:48.000 --> 51:59.000
It is clear that without financial flexibility in such conditions, it will be difficult for companies to cope with the unforeseen circumstances

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
Next, tax benefits from debt

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
We talked about the tax shield

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
Financial reliability is in the 4th and 5th places

52:10.000 --> 52:20.000
Theoreticians said that the structure of capital is the problem of tax economy

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
But it all started with this

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
And suddenly, this priority is in the 4th place

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Why?

52:27.000 --> 52:34.000
In global economy, tax optimization can be done in non-trivial ways

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
There are a lot of offshore companies, special financing schemes that allow to optimize tax time

52:41.000 --> 52:46.000
Therefore, it is unlikely that it is justified to connect it directly with the structure of capital

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
Strong companies can afford it

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
Therefore, it is only in the 4th place

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
As for financial reliability

52:57.000 --> 53:07.000
If there is intuition and experience of financial experts in the optimization of capital

53:07.000 --> 53:15.000
Then it is clear that the problem of reliability is subject level

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
The last situation related to this priority

53:20.000 --> 53:31.000
It seemed that it is unlikely that such arrangement of financial reliability is justified today

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
Let's go back to the example of the United States

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
The death of Enron

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
Information is all over the world

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
But it is a symbolic company, an electric company

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
It is the base industry of the United States

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
It just could not remain unnoticed for the US government

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It is over

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
The adoption of additional legislation

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
The amendments

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
It is a rarity in the US legal practice

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
The amendments to the legislation

54:07.000 --> 54:15.000
The requirements of the financial directors on financial reliability are getting stricter

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Look what happened

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
Now the US financial documents have two signatures

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
There was always one, now there are two

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
If we take the Russian practice

54:27.000 --> 54:35.000
Since the Soviet times, we have incorporated the term of the right of the second signature

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
The director of the plant, the chief accountant

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
One is responsible for the credit manager, his signature was required

54:43.000 --> 54:48.000
And the second signature is the head of the god as a financial controller

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
We still live with this practice

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
The whole world criticized us for two signatures

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
The more signatures, the more agreements, the more friction inside the company

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
Regarding the content of the financial documents

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
And suddenly the US went down this path

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
Now they require that both the financial director and the general director are signed

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Here is the price of financial reliability

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Although it is on the fifth place

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
A very important priority for financial directors, especially advanced companies

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
The theory of the optimal structure of the company is taken seriously

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
When the assessment of the company's credit rating is made

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
We have agreed that the first priority is financial flexibility

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
It should be provided with what?

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
With easy access to the capital market

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
When is easy access?

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
When the company has a credit rating

55:50.000 --> 55:59.000
For example, Intel, the computer, has the highest rating of 3 letters A

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
It has a rating of 2A

56:01.000 --> 56:08.000
It supports financial flexibility, that is, its financial dependence is very small

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
It relies mainly on its own capital

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
Having such a high credit rating

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
When there is a financial gap, it always turns to the capital market and solves its problems

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Therefore, the credit rating is expensive today

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
This problem has become relevant for Russian companies

56:27.000 --> 56:35.000
You see, the form of borrowing has been cut with the help of VEX programs

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
Starting from the second half of the 90s

56:39.000 --> 56:51.000
And until 2005, the VEX market was much higher than the bonds market

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
The standard market financial instruments

56:56.000 --> 57:06.000
In recent years, the bonds market has begun to outrun the VEX market

57:06.000 --> 57:15.000
Why did our entrepreneurs release VEX programs so easily?

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Because it does not require state registration

57:18.000 --> 57:26.000
You order a paper with a good degree of protection at the state sign factory

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
You enter the required VEX parameters

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
Here is the mission prospect, but it is a complicated document, it remains in the company

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Here are all the costs for the release of VEX

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
You do not need to register anywhere

57:41.000 --> 57:48.000
And you pay with these valuable papers for your debts

57:48.000 --> 57:56.000
As for the release of corporate bonds, it is already a market instrument

57:57.000 --> 58:03.000
Here, the registration of the Federal Financial Markets Service is required

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
It used to be the Federal Commission on Valuable Papers, but now it has been renamed

58:08.000 --> 58:13.000
So, this instrument requires openness to information

58:13.000 --> 58:21.000
In order to enter the public market, you need to get a credit rating first

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
You need to apply to Standard & Poor's or another company that has the right to assign these ratings

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
And the market recognizes them

58:29.000 --> 58:38.000
You get a credit rating, this is the starting point for a long-term loan

58:38.000 --> 58:51.000
In Russia, due to the rapid development of the bond market, the value of the credit rating becomes a priority for financial directors

58:51.000 --> 59:01.000
The next thing that financial directors of advanced companies insist on is to identify risks related to business financing

59:01.000 --> 59:09.000
Financial risks with the choice of capital structure and risks related to individual projects

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
Here is an example of a construction company in Shigersk, the CIS

59:13.000 --> 59:23.000
It seems that all this is calculated and the parameters of the risks were insured

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
There were two guarantees, one for the state and one for the head company

59:29.000 --> 59:38.000
The project took all the risks on itself, the project documentation took all the mistakes on itself

59:38.000 --> 59:46.000
The bankers took all the credit risks, it seemed that everything was calculated and the project failed

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
So, some risks were not identified

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
We understand that these were operational risks related to the misuse of capital

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And the project itself collapsed

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And the most relevant thing for today is the optimization of capital structure

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000
This is the main tool for managing capital in the conditions of the bond culture of the company

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Look how fast time flies, just two years ago, in Russian printing, the judgments about the implementation of bond thinking began

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And suddenly, the Western practice says not only about the bond thinking, but about the formation of the bond culture of the company

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:45.000
The culture oriented to the creation of value is the ability to maintain the balance between the current activity in creating value and investing in the development of future reserves of this business

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Look what is really happening

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:59.000
We just said that the financial market is much ahead of the physical asset market

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Why such a gap? Can we explain this gap from a scientific point of view?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yes, we can

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:17.000
When you look at the structure of the company's value with the well-known brands, what is clear?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
The value of any company today can be divided into two parts

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:30.000
The current value, I took the financial report, here is the property complex, it costs something, right?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
The current value is determined by it

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
The second part of the value is the future value

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:45.000
The gap between the current and future value of the company with the world brands reaches 20 times

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The future value is 20 times bigger than the current value

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:01.000
After the crisis in the NASDAQ market in America, when the high-tech companies fell short of the stock market index, the gap was reduced a little

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:09.000
But the financial market had a short memory, and the gap has risen again in recent years

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So we have forgotten the lesson of that crisis

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
What is a gap of 20 times?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:23.000
We said that the capital market is not limited in principle

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Why did it become possible?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
What is the future value expressed in?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Of course, it is expressed in money

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It is the future value that has provided the world financial market with a rapid growth

01:02:42.000 --> 01:03:02.000
If we understand this and get into the company's world ranking, there is no Russian company in the list of the top 100 brands

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
There is not even our great Gazprom

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It turns out that getting into this list is a great value

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So, realizing the realities we have understood in recent years, the world business has begun to form an internal culture

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
A special internal culture of business management

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
The culture is oriented to create value

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
How is this culture cultivated?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:50.000
As far as I know, the audience for this lecture is the middle-class managers

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Today they are called the people on the front line

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
This is a special term for people who occupy this level of management

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Why did this happen?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000
They took the main burden of implementing the strategies of each company

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
They are the direct guides of the company's strategy

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Therefore, the possession of this audience with financial knowledge is extremely important today

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
A lot depends on them

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
This culture is cultivated very simply

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
The parameters of creating value are moved to the lower levels of management

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:45.000
That is, a certain parameter is brought to each company's division, which pre-determines the company's growth

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
In principle, a very principled approach was found in the world of science

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.000
In 1982, one of the unique trading brands was registered

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Pay attention to the authors

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Stern and Stuart registered the EVA trading brand, economically added value

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:24.000
This formula, the idea of economically added value, was born from practice

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
These are practicing people, and they did the right thing by patenting it

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
What is the greatness of this formula?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I want to bring the parameters of the growth of business value to the business divisions

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
How to do this?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Economically added value is equal to the investment capital

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
CE is the volume of investment capital

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
However, investment capital should give a return

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
We agreed that the return of any capital is expressed in percents

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
20-30% per year

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Investment capital should give a return greater than the capital spent

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Again, the value is in brackets

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The profitability of investment capital minus the average capital spent

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Both are in percents

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The difference is multiplied by the volume of investment capital

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
If the value is positive, the value is created

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Here is the EVA, the economically added value

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
If the value is negative, the value is destroyed

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:58.000
The whole concern about the practical implementation of the value-oriented culture is implemented in a very simple way

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000
If I managed to select the EVA factors for a particular company, bring them to many divisions

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
As a control factor, they are included in the stimulation system

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And getting a positive value in brackets, the value increases

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
This is how modern business is managed
