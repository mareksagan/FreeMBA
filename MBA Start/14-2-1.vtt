00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello, my name is Evgeny Lunev. I am a teacher of IT module for a manager, which is part of MBA Start program.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
In previous lectures we have learned about the concept of information and its forms of transformation,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
such as information technology and information system.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
We have learned about the main concepts of IT strategy, IT standardization, business modeling,

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
and defined the key areas for IT in business. These areas are related to security, IT audit and economic efficiency.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
Finally, we have analyzed one of the most advanced and modern and promising methodologies of building relationships between IT and business,

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
namely, the organization of a service approach to the building of the information infrastructure of the company's enterprises

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
according to the recommendations of the ITIL library.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
We will start our journey with the concept of MRP and RP, that is, management of corporate resources.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
The perspective of the organization will be based on the position of a business corporation,

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
which provides that this corporation has some kind of a remote ownership, some kind of legal address,

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
that its functions of managing this corporation are concentrated in the hands of professional managers,

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
that is, employees who work for hiring.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Next, our corporation is inclined to expand diversification of various types of economic activities.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
For it, the growth of the scale of the volume of resources, including, for example, the increase in the number of employees, is characterized.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
Finally, it is inclined to expand the geography of its organizational units, that is, divisions,

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
that is, their expansion over the territory of Russia.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
Next, our corporation is virtually inclined to take into account the external economic environment,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
that is, the normative right environment, market infrastructure, competition and others,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
when developing some kind of its own strategy of activity.

02:19.000 --> 02:32.000
And finally, managers and top management of our virtual corporation are inclined or are the apologetics of the application of information technologies.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
As for the size and scale of the business of our corporation,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
from the position in which we will assess certain IT solutions or IT products,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
our corporation will correspond to the category of small and medium-sized business SMB,

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
which is striving to become a large distributed territorial holding.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
So, below is a incomplete list of the geographical business concepts,

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
which were formed approximately from the 50s of the last century,

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
and which were the basis of the standards of management and distribution of modern IT systems.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Look at the slides.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
So, I remind you that somewhere in the mid-50s, the first concept was the Taylor Scientific Labor Organization,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
and the cycle of quality of daming.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Then, somewhere in about 1965, the concept of MRP appeared,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
the planning of needs in materials.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
In 1975, this concept was transformed into MRP-1,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
the planning of needs in materials in a closed cycle,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
the composition of the production program and the control of its execution.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Further, in 1980, the concept of MRP-2 appeared,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
which is already a planning of production resources based on data from suppliers and consumers.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
It was also introduced a prognosis, planning, production control.

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
In 1985, the methodology or concept of MRP-2 was combined with the concept of Just-in-Time,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
that is, exactly in time, JIT,

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
and the so-called ability to optimize and narrow places in production and production appeared.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
In 1987, the significant event was the introduction of the standard of quality management,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
the ISO 9000.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
And in 1990, combining MRP with financial planning,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
an analogue of the modern ERP system appeared,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
that is, the planning of enterprise resources.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Distribution and planning have already become the subject of the information system itself,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
as well as financial planning, I repeat.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
In 1994, the concept of business process re-engineering was announced,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
the concepts of the life cycle of production were unified,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
the transition to the principles of constant improvement of corporate activities was carried out.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
And in 1996, the concept of SCM appeared,

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
that is, the management of chains of traffic, the movement of material and information flows,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
and the concept of CRM, management of marketing information,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
that is, contacts, sales and campaigns.

05:07.000 --> 05:20.000
All this was integrated or synergized in 2001-2002 into the so-called ERP-2 concept,

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
that is, the concept became integrated into the planning system of enterprise resources and external connections.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
The textbook shows the structure and the name of most of these theoretical concepts,

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
with English and Russian translations.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
We will not dwell on all these concepts,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
we will consider only some of them,

05:49.000 --> 05:59.000
which will allow us to assess the evolution, logic and dynamics of the development of theoretical concepts for information technologies.

05:59.000 --> 06:11.000
We will also consider only the key systems, such as ERP, SCM, BI, CRM systems,

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
which affect the business of any manager in any company.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
The concept of planning of material needs in ERP-1

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
involves the method of solving the following management tasks.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Namely, the formation of a schedule of supply, raw materials and components,

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
management of warehouses and accounting of returns, that is, supplies of materials.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
The concept of planning of needs in ERP production capacities

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
aims to improve the use of production capacities of work centers,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
that is, equipment, supply lines, work brigades.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
The system performs planning and balancing of the loading of these work centers,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
taking into account some resource restrictions, plans for the production of finished products.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
The information system of ERP and MRP classes

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
provides the implementation of the management functions from top to bottom,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
without accounting for feedback,

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
as well as the solution of functional tasks of planning of materials needs and production capacities.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Such functions of management as business planning,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
planning of sales, planning of production,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
development of the main calendar plan of production,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
were not covered.

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
Planning of ERP-2 resources is an improved method of planning of all types of business resources

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
and extension of the closed cycle,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
which was at the previous stages of ERP development.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
The most important installation of the ERP standard

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
is the provision of the leading personnel with the necessary information

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
for making management decisions.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
The ERP-2 system provides support for 16 functions of the management of the corporation,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
which can be grouped as follows.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
The first is business planning,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
the second is planning of sales and operations,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
the third is planning of production,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
the fourth is the formation of the main calendar plan of production,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
the fifth is planning of materials needs,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
the sixth is planning of capacity needs,

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
and finally, the seventh is the system of supporting the implementation of plans

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
for production capacities.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
The ERP-2 system is a detailed and precise production model.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
The main objects are shown on the slide.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
This is the enlarged plan of production needs,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
the plan of materials needs,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
the plan of production needs,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
and the financial plan.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
The disadvantages of ERP-2 are the lack of integration

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
with the management processes of finances and personnel,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
and the orientation to the existing orders.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
There is no special task complex for forecasting demand.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Another disadvantage is the weak integration

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
with the design and design systems,

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
that is, with the so-called SAPR systems,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
that is, with the automated design systems,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
that is, with the construction and production systems.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
Since the 1990s, ERP-2 has been integrated with the financial resource planning module

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
and the business planning system.

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
As a result, the enterprise planning system has been formed,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
which allows to effectively plan the commercial activities of the corporation,

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
the financial resources, equipment resources,

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
as well as to prepare investment projects.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
The ERP methodology is based on the principle of a single repository of data,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
which contains all the business information accumulated by the corporation

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
during the business operation.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
This includes financial information,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
data related to production, management of personnel,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
as well as any other information.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
The main feature of ERP-2 MRP system

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
is the fundamental principle of systematic and functional integrity of the management system.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Such systems can be used to manage enterprises of various scales,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
as they allow to optimize business processes

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
to reduce production costs and to implement the production, work and services.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
They can be used to plan and manage the stock of material values,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
to manage the cost of the product,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
to reduce costs or unfinished production,

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
to reduce the production cycle,

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
to take into account the work of each production unit,

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
to make changes to the production plan

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
and to improve the service of the clients and customers of the corporation.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
However, with the accumulation of experience of modeling production and non-production business processes,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
the concept of ERP is constantly being refined,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
improving, embracing more and more business functions,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
such as working with clients,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
working with supply chain management,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
assistance system in decision-making,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
e-commerce system.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
The foundation of such integration is the unification of the concept of the life cycle of the product,

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
the transition to the principles of constant improvement of the enterprise,

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
which often forced to abandon the strict administrative hierarchical management schemes,

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
as well as the aspiration and the emergence of information system

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
for the description of business processes and enterprise models,

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
Therefore, the key integral definition of ERP system can be given as follows.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
ERP system is a kind of integration component approach to corporate management,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
which is based on information technology,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
quality management system, international standards, business model,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
mechanisms of constant improvement of management activities.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Thanks to ERP system,

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
more than 90 business processes of any corporation can be integrated.

12:26.000 --> 12:33.000
In 2001, the already mentioned consulting system Gartner Group introduced the concept of ERP-2,

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
which differs from the usual traditional ERP systems by the following features.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
First of all, it is an expanded functionality of ERP systems,

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
that is, a complete automation of the functions of the management system in real-time.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Next, it is the significance of ERP system for the activities of the corporation.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
That is, ERP system becomes the core of the corporate management system.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
Next, it is the transition from the automation of internal business processes in the company

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
to the free interaction of the company with its counter-agents,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
that is, customers, suppliers, banks, tax authorities, and so on.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
The next distinguishing feature is that ERP-2 systems,

13:14.000 --> 13:25.000
both internal and external, do not feel any restrictions on the scale or geographical location.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
In fact, the distance does not matter for the ERP system user.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
The next feature of ERP system is openness,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
that is, support for interaction with external information systems

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
based on standard technologies and software interfaces.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
The next feature is a unified information space,

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
which is created in ERP-2 system for the adoption of management decisions,

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
high level of information quality for the implementation of functions of management,

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
as well as the introduction of modern information methods and data processing technologies.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
And, of course, another distinctive feature is high reliability of ERP-2 systems

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
and corporate information systems based on ERP-2,

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
protection of data from unauthorized access and other threats of integrity and data preservation,

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
as well as a friendly user interface.

14:27.000 --> 14:35.000
In fact, the descriptive answers to the following points are based on the business model of the corporation.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
What business functions do they have?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
What does the business do?

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
How does the enterprise implement these functions?

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
What business processes exist for the implementation of these functions?

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Where are these business functions and processes executed?

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
What is the organizational structure of the enterprise or corporation?

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
When or in what sequence should these business functions or processes be implemented?

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
This question determines the phases of these business functions and processes.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
And, of course, who performs these business processes?

15:18.000 --> 15:25.000
Who determines the roles of these business units in the implementation of these business functions or processes?

15:25.000 --> 15:35.000
And all this is connected with some general rules.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
And this is expressed in the corresponding descriptions, regulations and models.

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
The slide shows the business model of the corporation for understanding the ERP system.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
It makes sense for our virtual SMB corporation,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
that is, a corporation related to medium and small business,

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
to focus on some requirements that should be applied to its ERP system.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
One of these requirements should be full functionality.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
This is the most comprehensive coverage of business functions.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
That is, the answer to the question, what does the business do?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
According to the research corporation Aberdeen Group,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
it was in August 2006,

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
69% of medium enterprises and 64% of small businesses

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
were chosen by the functionality as a determining factor

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
by the criteria of the function of the ERP system.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
That is, they operate the system for 3-5 years,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
and this system should give feedback,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
that is, perform the functions that they put into it.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
And it is desirable that the chosen ERP solution or ERP system

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
allowed to expand the business,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
that is, it should be scalable, not only fully functional.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
The next requirement is flexibility and control.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
That is, the ability to better control the business,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
which implies some development, some rules, procedures

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
throughout the enterprise, throughout the corporation,

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
the creation of some accounting backbone,

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
finance, materials and other resources.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Based on this backbone,

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
some decisions on the issues of the corporation will be made.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Further, such a system as the ERP system,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
as the ease of mastering,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
it is clear, because small and medium enterprises

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
do not have large IT resources,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
so the degree of complexity of installation or implementation of the system

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
should be provided with ease of mastering.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Therefore, the basic requirement here is some kind of graphical interfaces,

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
allowing the user to easily and quickly master some expanded functions of the ERP system.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
These interfaces are preferred to be localized,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
translated to the language of the business owner,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
or the manager.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
They should offer the user convenience of configuration,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
simple, in fact, methods.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Drag and drop,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
that is, you take the icon,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
transfer it, grab it,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
with this minimum number of clicks,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
you need to control.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
Also, as ease of mastering,

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
it is desirable that the ERP system has so-called dashboards,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
that is, the dashboards of the device parallel management,

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
where the manager can see on certain issues

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
how a given indicator, KPI, changes.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
If, for example, something on production changes in the worse direction,

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
then, of course, this indicator, as an indicator dashboard,

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
should show, for example, red, yellow, or green, if everything is in order.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Further, the requirements of ease of maintenance, in fact,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
that is, ease of support and maintenance,

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
since IT departments of our corporations, especially small and medium-sized,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
have insignificant resources, I have already mentioned this.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Further, availability at the price and predictability.

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
It is meant that the ERP system itself for small and medium-sized enterprises

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
should not affect too much and be available at the total cost of ownership,

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
and not only for purchase, but also for support,

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
for expansion, for changing some functionality, and so on.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
And, of course, the last requirement for our ERP systems

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
is to use the best practice, the best experience in a particular business area.

19:57.000 --> 20:06.000
Therefore, there is a typical set that can automate the ERP system.

20:06.000 --> 20:14.000
In your textbook, you have a complete set of automated business processes.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Here I will only point out some of them.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
Production, for example, management of the workshop schedule,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
product configuration, business analysis,

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
that is, working with the system in self-related indicators,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
the Balancer Scorecard,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
design of some multidimensional analytical cubes,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
we will talk about this a little bit later,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
internal and external audit,

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
in order to understand and analyze the business process,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
distribution, some distribution functions,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
that is, management of the distribution system,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
processing of orders,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
orders taking into account some commercial agreements,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
management of sales and marketing,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
telemarketing, again,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
marketing, management of sales,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
service to customers via the Internet,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
management of supply chains,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
again, forecast planning,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
management of supply,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
further, management of service activities,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
that is, support of the widest possible range of service operations,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
again, management of repairs,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
further, management of projects,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
implementation of some current activity for various projects,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
planning and analysis of the results of these projects,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
of course, management of personnel,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
that is, organizational structure of the enterprise,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
monitoring, moving of personnel,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
selection, management of personnel qualification,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
management of finances,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
that is, accounting of the main funds,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
calculation of the salary,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
accounting of the accounts, and so on.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
These are the main business processes

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and business functions,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
that the ERP system should automate.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
As the history of the development of the ERP concept shows,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
traditionally, in fact,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
at the very beginning of the traditional ERP system,

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
they were also oriented to increase flexibility and transparency.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
And although these systems allowed to improve

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
the processing of orders, products,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
their capabilities were not enough

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
to manage complex business processes.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Since to solve this task,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
especially at the modern stage,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
any business needs to create

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
some kind of ecosystem around itself,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
which would push the most valuable clients

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and interested persons

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
to share business knowledge with each other.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
This is what the ERP-2 system should do.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
In fact,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
again,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
translating the words of the analysts from Gartner,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
we can say that the ERP system,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
ERP-2,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
is a kind of business strategy

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and a set of applications

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
oriented to provide a specific industry,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
a corporation,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and to increase the value of the company

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
for its clients

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and for its owners

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
by supporting and optimizing

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
operational and financial processes,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
by working together inside and between enterprises.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
In other words,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
ERP-2 is a competitive strategy

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
of integrating the centralized ERP system base

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
with such narrowly specialized solutions

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
as client management system,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
supplier management system,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
knowledge management system,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
and so on.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
The high-quality difference between ERP-2 and traditional ERP systems

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
is the ability to manage the information chain of values

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
to create a massive long-term

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
internal and external relations.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
In other words,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
a chain of community of values is created,

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
which increases the transparency of access to information,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
speeds up the decision-making process

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and reduces the most important response time

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
to these decisions.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
It promotes the availability of knowledge

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
for joint dialogue,

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
which may result in new ideas,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
innovations,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
and optimal solutions to complex problems.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
The next slide shows

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
the cross-section of knowledge areas

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
for continuous business improvement.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
ERP system is a part of the system

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and integrates with business modeling,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
corporate culture,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
and human factor.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
This synergy allows

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
to constantly improve corporations,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
to constantly innovate corporations.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Joseph Schumpeter,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
the great economist of the last century,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
said that profit can be obtained

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
not only from exploitation of a person

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
or from some kind of economy,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
but also from the fact that an entrepreneur

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
can constantly come up with new ideas

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
for his business

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
and draw profit from it.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
Now, a little bit about the ERP market in Russia.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
It is growing

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
by 30-35% per year,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
according to the analysts.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
It is a good growth.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
The main ERP vendors

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
are shown on the slide.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
The main share is

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
owned by German company SAP,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
American company Oracle,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Russian company 1S,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Microsoft,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Russian company Paros.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
The second slide shows

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
the evaluation of the ERP implementation

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
of two leading vendors,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Oracle and SAP.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
These evaluations are

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
from the point of view

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
of small and medium business.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
The most significant criteria

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
for choosing ERP are also shown,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
such as functionality,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
ease of use,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
and total value of ownership.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
The following two slides

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
show the demand for different IT systems

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
for small and medium business,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
as well as the cost of ERP projects,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
average costs of their implementation,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and the time duration of these projects

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
for the implementation of ERP systems.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
So, those customers

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
who do not have enough funds

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
for the comprehensive,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
that is, the whole purchase

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
and implementation of ERP systems,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
usually start the implementation

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
with some modules.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Usually, it is an accounting module

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
or accounting of the main funds,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
commodity values,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
or management of staff

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
and salary calculations,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
or management of production,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
planning, logistics,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
or management of relations with clients.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
It depends on

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
which business is the most critical

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
or which business function is the most critical.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
According to many IT companies

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
that implement ERP systems

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
for their business customers,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
the threshold for the implementation

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
of the western ERP system

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
is about 5 million dollars.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And even 1 million dollars

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
is enough

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
to implement some flexible modules,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
some key modules,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
that will allow

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
to raise the business

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
to a new height.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
As for the domestic ERPs,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
the initial cost of the implementation,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
including costs for IT audit and consulting,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
is about 100 thousand dollars.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Again, I repeat,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
that the examples of such systems

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
for the medium enterprises

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
are called

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Microsoft Dynamics X-Apto,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Microsoft Dynamics Navision,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
SAP Business One,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Oracle Standard Edition,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and our domestic 1S enterprise

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
version 8.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Of course, there are others.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
As the Russian economy develops,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
the sector of the medium-to-small business

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
will develop rapidly,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
and it is developing

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
rapidly now.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
This leads to the improvement

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
of organizational structure

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
and business processes,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
to the increase of competition.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And here it is impossible

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
to do without IT management solutions.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
In fact, one of such solutions

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
is the implementation of ERP systems

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
in the practice of the economy.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
So, let's continue our journey

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
on IT concepts.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Let's consider CRM systems

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
and SCM systems,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
that is, the work with clients,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
customers and suppliers.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Here we will consider the issues

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
of marketing and logistics automation.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
According to the definition

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
of the same Gartner Group,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
the system of client-to-client relations

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
is, in fact, a business strategy

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
designed to optimize

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
the income, profitability

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
and satisfaction of clients.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
In fact, according to the research

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
of the Russian market,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
the CRM system,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
which was developed by the company

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
DSS Consulting in July 2007,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
more than 50% of all CRM solutions

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
are now in the hands

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
of banks, insurance companies

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
and some investment companies.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
This is shown in the slide.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
The modern stage of development

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
of the management system

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
corresponds to the concept

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
of marketing interaction,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
that is, the construction of a network

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
of suppliers and consumers.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
The basis of this is the use

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
of the electronic business,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
which significantly transformed

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
the structure of the enterprise,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
influenced the automation

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
of business processes

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
of such branches as marketing,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
production, supply and demand.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
The main goal of the CRM system

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
is to create a network

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
of suppliers and consumers

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
that will be able

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
to provide the necessary

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
information to the client

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
and to the client

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
in the process of marketing,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
production, supply and demand,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
neocor, finance, personnel,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
as well as for the collective use

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
of which are some legal

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
or recruiting agencies or audits.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
In this regard, the tasks

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
of the CRM system are

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
the first one,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
to provide the operational access

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
to information during contact

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
with the client

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
in the process of sale or service.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
This includes marketing,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
sales and service.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
The second one is the joint analysis

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
of the data that characterizes

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
the activity of the client and the company.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
The third one is to get new knowledge

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
and conclusions of the recommendations.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Here, complex mathematical models

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
for searching some statistical

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
patterns are used,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
the most effective marketing,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
sales or service strategies

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
are developed.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
The fourth task is to provide

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
the direct participation of the client

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
in the activities of the corporation

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
and the possibility to influence

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
the processes of the product development,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
production or service service.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Let's stop at the typical

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
possibilities of the modern CRM systems.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
The first one is the classification

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
of contacts in different categories.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
The second one is the determination

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
of the target groups for advertising companies.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
The third one is the development

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
of the sales cycle, management

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
of their capabilities and analysis,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
the fourth one is the planning

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and control of the actions for each contact,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
such as phone calls,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
visits, marketing materials

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
and so on.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
The fifth one is the simplified

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
access to the data of existing

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
and potential clients,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
dealers, agents, partners,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
competitors and in general contact persons.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
The sixth one is the implementation

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
of some marketing tasks.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
The seventh one is the effective management

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
of the trading and marketing information.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
The eighth one is the implementation

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
of the services of the companies

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
and the clients' requirements

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
and the automation of the tasks

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
for the implementation of the services.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
The development of the CRM concept

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
led to the emergence of other concepts

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
and directions, such as

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
the management of the relationships

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
with the enterprises,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
the so-called Enterprise Relationship Management,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
the ERM.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
The peculiarity of this system

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
is that when the systems

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
of supply chains

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
and the systems of clients

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
are connected together,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
that is, their synergy

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
develops at the same speed,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
that is, if these two systems

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
are combined,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
it will be a super system

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
that automates all the relationships

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
and business processes

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
in a separately owned company.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Such systems are called

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
ERM – Enterprise Relationship Management.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
The main advantage of this system

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
is that it is a comprehensive

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
management system.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
The ERM plus SCM equals EIM.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You can write it like this.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
The second concept is the management

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
of the main funds.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
EAM – Enterprise Asset Management.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
This is also a management methodology

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
that allows you to increase

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
the production capacity of the enterprise

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
only by using IT,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
IT technologies, products or solutions,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
without resorting to the purchase

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
of some kind of a product.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
At the same time,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
EAM solution is one of the main links

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
that connect the information management

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
systems of the production processes

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
with the business processes

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
of the enterprise management,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
that is, ERP systems.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
As a result,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
the EAM system reduces

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
the time of waiting,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
the costs of maintenance,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
equipment,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
and so on.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
This is a very important

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
reason why the main funds

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
are becoming more economical

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
and more efficient.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Examples of ERP systems solutions

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
can be in the case of small

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
and medium-sized businesses.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I will name them only.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
There are a lot of them.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
These are Sales Expert,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Consi Marketing,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Sales Logics,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
IST,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Oracle,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
SAP,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
BAN,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and other.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
There are a lot of them.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
So,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
let's summarize.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
The core of the ERP system

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
is the functional

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
for managing the business

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
processes of the companies,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
which determines the ability

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
of the ERP system

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
to increase the efficiency of the business.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Due to what?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Due to the reduction of some

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
routine functions,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
due to the training of new staff,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
due to the implementation

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
of the best practices

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
and organization of work

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
according to some regulations.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Another feature of the ERP system

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
is the modules

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
providing high-quality

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and fast service to the clients.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I mean the modules

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
of the Call Center,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
as well as the Service Desk,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Help Desk,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Service Service.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
This module

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
helps the companies

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
with a large number of clients

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
to manage the incidents and problems,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
to process the requests,

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
to serve the clients on time,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
and to take into account

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
the costs of their service.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Another

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
very remarkable

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
feature of the ERP system

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
is the implementation

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
of the so-called sales pipeline.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
You've probably

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
studied it in marketing.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I'll just mention it.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
The sales pipeline

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
and the forecast technology

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
are designed to provide

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
a reasonable planning

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
of the sales.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
The pipeline serves

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
to assess the number

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
and quality of the possible deals

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
with potential clients.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
The sales cycle is based on

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
the initial investment

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and the sales that starts

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
with the information

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
that comes in the form

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
of incoming calls,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
letters, requests

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
from potential clients

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
and accumulates

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
either in the marketing department

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
or actively gathers

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
in the telemarketing department

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
through some cold calls.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Then the filter of the adequacy

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
of the received information

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
starts to work,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
and the profile of the client

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
is determined.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The deal may be disqualified

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and not be accepted

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
into the pipeline.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
The sales department

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
does not take any action

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
on this information.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
But this information is registered

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
in the ERP system

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
so that it can be returned

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
after a certain period of time

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
or to avoid any

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
repeated actions in the future.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
The information is transferred

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
to the sales manager

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
for subsequent qualifications

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
and the next sales cycle

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
starts here.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
It turns out to be

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
a funnel that is spinning

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
until the deal is closed

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
and the sale is made.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
That's why it is called

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
a funnel of sales.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Let's briefly talk about

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
SCM systems.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
You have already studied them

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
in the Start MBA module

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
on the program

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
dedicated to production management.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Here we will only touch upon

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
those issues that explain

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
how IT affects the supply chain in general.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Let me remind you

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
what is Supply Chain Management.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
SCM.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
In literal translation,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
it means the management

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
of the supply chain.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
It is a chain of

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
interconnected objects,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
material and information

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
flows of the enterprise,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
its suppliers, distributors and clients.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
In every link of this complex chain

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
there is an inevitable loss of time,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
resources, money.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Money is lost somewhere.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
For example,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
due to some disagreements,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
due to excessive storage,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
due to irrational delivery

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
and so on.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Unlike ERP system,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
SCM solution

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
is based on

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
the minimization of these costs.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
That is, increasing productivity

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
and delivery speed.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And the main thing is synchronization

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
of management of connected business processes

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
in all links of the supply chain.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It is shown very well on the slide.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
The general process scheme works on the warehouse.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Receiving, placing, planning,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
selection, ordering, replenishment.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
And the main thing that supports

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
business processes

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
in SCM chain is

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
inventorying, moving,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
correction, processing,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
forming accounts,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
management of warehouse resources,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
transaction control,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
processing of returns, transfer, billing.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Traditionally,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
SCM system is divided

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
into planning system,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
supply chain planning,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
and management system,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
supply chain execution,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
SCE.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
SCE system allows

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
to calculate optimal structure

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
of the supply chain,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
and also provides a complex planning

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
of the entire supply chain and management of reserves.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
And at the same time,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
taking into account some resource limitations

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
of production,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
SCM system is building a supply chain.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Using the SCE system,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
which is gaining popularity now,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
planning and management of the supply

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
is carried out.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It is called

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
SRM, Supply Relationship Management.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And also storage,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
warehouse management system,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
WMS,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
and transportation.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
The development of SCM

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
is the most active

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
in such growing

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
and consolidating markets

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
as retail,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
distribution,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
car manufacturing,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
metallurgy, and so on.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
That is, where the role of planning

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
of supply is important,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
and the minimization of logistic costs,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
and the clear control of cost

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
and supply channels.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Let's turn to the analysts

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
of Gartner Group.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
They highlight the following

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
most capacious and business-like

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
applications of logistic management

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
systems in business.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
The first is non-stop production.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
The second is warehouse production.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
The third is order production.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The fourth is order assembly.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
The fifth is retail trading.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
The sixth is service-oriented business.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
That is, business for a specific client

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
or for a particular manufacturer.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
And distribution.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Recently,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
there has been a tendency

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
to include retail trading

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
in a single integrated business management system.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
In modern SEM solutions,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
it is necessary to have

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
both optimal and synchronous planning

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
of the goods movement

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
in both directions.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
That is, from the ready-made product,

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
that is, from the supplier to the consumer,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
back to the defective product,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
from the consumer back to the supplier.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That is, the return chain of supplies

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
is also of great importance.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
The main functional areas

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
and processes of the return chain of supplies,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
although they include

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
stores, warehouses, production,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
but they are very different

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
from the functionality

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
that supports the direct supply chain,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
that is, from the traditional SEM solution.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Therefore, companies

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
that very often deal with returns,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
let's say, cell operators,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
electronics sellers,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
clothing manufacturers,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
and so on,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
allocate the return management

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and service management

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
to a separate business.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Sometimes they even transfer it to outsourcing,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
which can bring up to 40% of the profit.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Finally,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
another key trend

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
of the development of SEM systems

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
is the transition from the push,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
that is, the strategy of managing

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
the supply chain,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
to the pull, the strategy.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
It is designed to change

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
the conceptual basis of the SEM solution.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Most of the modern systems

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
of this class

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
are based on the push strategy,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that is, the maximization of the passability

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
of existing distribution channels

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
and the minimization of production

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
of logistical costs.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
This is their paradigm of work.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
At the same time,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
the algorithm of the optimal plan

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
implies that if a company

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
strives to raise the service level,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
it has to deal

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
with the absence of a product.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
It has to deal with it automatically,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
with the increase of costs

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
for the maintenance of some reserves,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
for more frequent transportation.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
The task of the optimization of the chain

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
is to find the minimum

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
when the service level

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
is increased.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
The strategy pull

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
is opposed to this statement.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
The effectively organized supply chains

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
are able to raise the service level

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
and reduce the production

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
logistical costs.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
If earlier companies built

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
their supply chains

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
based on their own cost,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
production schedules,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
then the mass outsourcing

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
in China, India

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
or other countries

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
led to the realization

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
that the reduction of the stock

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
and the timely delivery

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
of the goods

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
is no less important

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
than the reduction of the cost

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
and production.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
The new generation

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
of the S7 system

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
emphasizes the prognosis

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
of demand

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
and the effective supply chain

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
through the reverse distribution

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
of demand

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
in the chain of cost.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
The logistics of production

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
is a simple example.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
The most popular

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Apple iPod

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
costs about $1000.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Its cost in the West

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
is about $299.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
The cost of production

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
is about $5.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
The rest of the

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
$299

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
is divided

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
by the designers

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
and programmers

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
of the brand.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
The second half

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
is taken by the tax authorities

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
and logistic firms.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
The cost of $5

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
cannot be compared

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
to the cost of the logistic firm.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
In this case,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
the S7 solution

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
will be the most advanced

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
than the implementation

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
of the ERP system

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
in the Chinese enterprise.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
This is an example.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
What are the suppliers

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
of the S7 solution?

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
They are the big companies

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
that offer the same ERP systems.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
This is a module of the solution

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
that is included

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
in the general structure of ERP.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
There is also

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
a whole assortment

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
of solutions

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
of the B2B class.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
In particular,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
SAP offers

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
the solution

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
of the German company

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
or the company

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
of the I2 class.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
There are other solutions

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
and other vendors.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
So, we have

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
a stable trend

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
when three key sources

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
of information for marketing,

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
sales and advertising,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
namely, the marketing research,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
the SRM and SCM systems,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
as well as the business intelligence data

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
are integrated into a single system

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
based on the modernized data collection,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
analysis and delivery.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
This system is the basis

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
of a higher level

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
of business management.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
It is necessary to generate ideas

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
and make decisions,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
as well as to manage knowledge.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
If we take a look at the full-fledged

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
functioning human body,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
the digital nervous system,

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
namely, the SRM system,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
will consist of

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
the brain of the marketing research

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
as well as the sensor system,

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
namely, the business intelligence data

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
and the specialized components,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
as well as the CSM system

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
or other specialized components.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
The network communications,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
analytics,

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
the integrated elements

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
of the software applications,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
data collection

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
and the results of the marketing research

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
will be necessary

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
to bring everything

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
into harmony and order.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
In order to understand the consumer

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
and to declare,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
or as the founder of the management,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Mr. Drucker,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
said,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
that the goal of the business

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
is to produce a satisfied client,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
in order to produce

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
a satisfied client,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
we need to strive for some new

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
conceptual and functional changes,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
the result of which

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
should be the unification of companies

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
specialized in the CRM systems

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
and ERP systems,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
the SCM systems,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
the marketing research

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
and the business analysis.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
So,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
let's continue

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
to look at our concepts

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
and now we will look at the concept

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
of business efficiency monitoring,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
that is, the products of business analytics

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
or, as it is now called,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
business intelligence.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
The term business intelligence,

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
BI,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
was coined by Howard Dressner,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
now the vice-president of Gardner Group,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
a company that is now gone,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
in 1989.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
It was coined

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
to design a set of concepts

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and a method of increasing

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
the efficiency of business decision-making

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
using some kind of fact-graphic

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
information systems.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
The correct translation of business intelligence

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
is business intelligence,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
that is, business intelligence,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
competitive intelligence,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
which has nothing to do

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
with IT technologies and IT solutions.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
But the BI systems

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
of the early 90s,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
of the 20th century

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
and the end of the 90s

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
brought IT technologies

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
to the concept

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
of business intelligence,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
that is,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
to the BI concept.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
That is,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
BI systems appeared

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
in the early 90s

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and the main reason

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
for their appearance

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
was the widespread

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
introduction of

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
some corporate information systems,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
which allowed

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
to quickly collect

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
significant volumes of data

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
and process it.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Before them,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
according to the estimates

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
of other analysts

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
from IBM,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
only 2 or even 4%

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
of the data

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
was processed by companies

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
or influenced the decision-making.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Thus,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
the information systems

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
and information resources

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
that were not used effectively

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
were, in fact,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
the reason for the birth

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
of BI systems.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Another event

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
that influenced

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
the emergence

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
of business analytics

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
was the fact

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
that since 2004

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
there was

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
a legislative

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
or legal reason

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
for the enterprises

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
that wanted

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
or were associated

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
with the US business.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Namely,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
the well-known

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
financial abuse scandals

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
of the leadership

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
of a number of corporations

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
such as Enron or Worldcom.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Approximately,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
on November 15, 2004,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
the law of

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Sarbanes-Oxley

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
was finally introduced

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
and adopted in 2002.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
It was also called

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
SOX.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
S-O-X

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
It was intended to provide

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
some ethical behavior

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
to the companies

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
by observing

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
the information disclosure process.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
In particular,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
all financial accounts

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
should contain information

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
about all transactions,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
agreements,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
obligations and other

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
relations related

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
to the business processes

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
of the company.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
This was also the reason

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
for the birth

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
or the stimulus

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
of the emergence

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
of the BIOSystems

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
that provide

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
a fast data collection

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
and a complex data analysis

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
of the business processes.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Thus,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
today's BIOSystems

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
are a means

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
of turning the information

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
accumulated by the enterprises

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
or corporations into capital

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
and a monitoring system

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
for the managers' actions

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
in the corporations.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
It is important

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
that the information

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
is delivered to the employees

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
in a convenient way and on time.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Today, it is necessary

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
to understand the vast amount

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
of fast data,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
to present the information

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
systematically and

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
to assess the effectiveness

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
of the activity

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
based on specific KPIs.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Companies that want

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
to make a step forward

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
should do everything

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
to ensure that their employees

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
always have access

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
to the important information

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
and deliver it on time.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
The following two slides

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
show the entire cycle

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
of business analysis

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
and management

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
of the business processes

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
of the corporations

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
from the perspective of BIOSystems.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
It is a report and analysis,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
then we move to the management

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
of the data storage,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
and then we move to the report

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
and analysis.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It is a cycle of business analysis

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
that manages

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
the modern corporation.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
At the current stage,

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
the BI Concept is a separate

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
direction of activity

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
that includes data collection

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
on the economic security

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
of the enterprise,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
statistical and logical analysis

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
and the management

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
of the important information

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
that allows to reduce the risk

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
when making some important

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
and fundamental decisions

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
for the development of the business.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Data collection and analysis

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
within the scope of business analysis

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
includes both macroeconomic processes

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
and legal field,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
that is, monitoring of the general state

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
of the external environment

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
in the state of the legal environment,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
as well as external microeconomic processes,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
that is, monitoring of competitors,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
as well as internal corporate processes,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
that is, monitoring of the internal

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
state of the activities of the unit

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
up to a specific employee.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
The typical BIOSystem contains the following modules.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
They are shown on the slide.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Module 1 is a set of

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
data storage organization tools,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
so-called data warehouse,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Module 2 is a subsystem

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
for extracting data

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
about transactions from various database

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
and converting them into a standard

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
BIOSystem,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
that is, the so-called ETL system,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Extract, Transform and Load.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Then the third module is a system

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
of business activity monitoring,

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
business processes,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
business activity monitoring

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
or business process monitoring.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
The fourth module is a subsystem

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
for generating requests and reports,

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
query and reporting.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And the fifth module is

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
a module of the business process

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
analysis,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
that is,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
online analytic processing,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
or lab system,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
and data mining.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Let's take a look at the functioning

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
of these systems.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Data storage organization tools

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
and data showcase provide

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
the BIOSystem with some

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
data arrays,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
and they must be specialized,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
extracted from the corporate system.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
They are also structured

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
in an optimal way

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
for subsequent analysis.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
The slide shows

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
how the BIOSystem functions.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
That is,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
data is extracted from the operational sub-system

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
and some external data,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
data storage is created,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
that is, the so-called OLAP cube.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
OLAP cube is,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
to explain it with fingers,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
a representation of data

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
in a three-dimensional

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
and more spatial way.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
That is,

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
when we have

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
a two-dimensional system of coordinates,

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
and this one is three-dimensional.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
This is an OLAP cube analog.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
That is, we can analyze

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
data on, for example,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
sales,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
here on time of sales,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
and here on territories.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Or instead of territories,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
maybe a third one,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
here it is,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
to explain with fingers what OLAP cube is.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Next, we will look at it again.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
And from OLAP cubes

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
some data showcases are obtained,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
that is,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
sharpened for some specific purposes,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
some specific tasks

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
of data storage.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
As a rule,

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
data showcases differ from data storage

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
in that they contain

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
a multitude of data,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
not all, but a multitude

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
relating to some particular topic or activity.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
And the whole operational database

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
together with external sources of information

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
should be considered as raw material

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
for the creation of subject-oriented,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
integrated,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
unchangeable by structure

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
chronological data,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
that is, analyzed in systems

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
to support decision-making,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
which subsequently

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
and based on subsequent decisions.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
For example, a showcase or a kiosk

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
is a multitude of chronological data

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
providing the necessary

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
performance of obtaining and analyzing data

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
for the end users

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
and protection from unauthorized access.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Data storage itself

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
is, in fact,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
subject-oriented,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
integrated and, again, unchangeable

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
set of data

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
supporting some chronology,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
organized for decision-making.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
As a rule, they are oriented

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
towards analysis

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
and decision-making

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and some data representation.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Data integration

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
between different transaction processing systems

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and multidimensional data storage

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
is provided

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
by the system

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
of data extraction,

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
conversion and recording.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
In fact, it is a connecting link

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
between OLTP systems

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
and data storage,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
data showcases,

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
and data showcases.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
OLTP systems are designed

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
to access data databases,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
consolidate them,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
convert them into a certain format

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
and store them

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
and record them there.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
The monitoring system of business activity

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
monitors the business processes

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
at the enterprise in real time,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
receives data from the transaction processing system,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
and stores the monitoring data

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
while simultaneously

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
undergoing some kind of analysis

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
and control of the state.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
In case of any rules

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
or indicators

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
being activated,

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
for example, the process

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
going beyond the standard limits,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
the OLTP system automatically

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
notifies the person responsible

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
for the process

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
about the occurrence of a problem

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
and provides detailed data

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
for optimal decision-making.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It is usually expressed

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
as an interface

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
or a dashboard

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
or a dashboard

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
in which

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
some KPI indicator

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
is colored

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
either red

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
or yellow

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
or green.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
The business is in order.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
The sub-system of generating

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
requests and reports is designed

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
to quickly generate

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
and select data

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
from the data storage

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
for a specified shelter.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Such selection

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
provides the possibility

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
of retrospective analysis

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
of business processes

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
in the right order

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
and a certain degree of detail.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
The means of processing

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
of arbitrary requests

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
that select data

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
more flexibly

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
in accordance with

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
some non-standard needs

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
of the users

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
is a high flexibility

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
when creating

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
complex reports

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
and the possibility

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
of obtaining information

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
in real-time.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
OLAP requires some processing

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
and some lag time

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
for the system to be able

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
to analyze and provide

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
the necessary analysis result.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The means of data analysis

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
of the BI system

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
is divided into two categories.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
The first one is OLAP

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and the second one is

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
the Interactual Data Analysis

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
or DM

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
or Knowledge Discovery.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The OLAP means

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
that it is a system

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
that conducts

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
a multidimensional data analysis

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
based on selected data

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and provides the necessary

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
data analysis results

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
in a cross-table

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
with the possibility

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
of detail analysis

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
based on each indicator

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
and forms the so-called

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
OLAP-coupes that I mentioned.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The means of data mining

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
and corporate data analysis

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
are designed

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
to detect

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
the correlation between

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
the stored data

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
and to identify some trends.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
For this purpose,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
complex mechanisms,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
statistical and special

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
methods of data analysis

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
can also be used.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
There are also imitation models

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
of business processes.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The slide shows

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
the cycle of using

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
the data mining technology

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
in business analysis.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
The first stage

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
is the business task setting.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
The specific business tasks

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
are formulated.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
The task setting

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
is quite extensive.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
For example,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
to build high-profit profiles

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
or to identify groups

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
of unloyal customers.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
In the future,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
the tasks will be clarified,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
expanded and deepened

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
by the cycle.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
The second stage

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
is the primary data analysis.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
The business task is formulated

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
and the preliminary data analysis

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
is started.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
The third stage

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
is the data preparation

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
for further analysis.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
For example,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
to deliver,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
to reformat, etc.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
The fourth stage

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
is the data analysis.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
The technical process

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
and the range of algorithms

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
are very extensive.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
From the methods of

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
unclear clustering

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and tree solutions

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
to the methods of

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
unclear linguistic rules.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
The fifth stage

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
is the interpretation of the results.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
The final stage

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
is the data presentation

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
in a convenient and clear form

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
to evaluate and make

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
a business decision.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
As an example,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
we consider the business case

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
of making a typical decision

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
in business analysis

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
based on the information collection

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
from the mass media

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and the Internet.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
The following slides

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
show the conceptual

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and logical scheme.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
As a rule,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
the user must solve

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
three tasks.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
The first is to be able

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
to connect to the sources

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
of unstructured information

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and structured data.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
The second task is

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
to be able to

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
process large volumes of information

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
in a normal and objective way.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
The third task is to present

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
the results of the analysis

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
in a convenient form.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
In other words,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
the connection,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
data extraction,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
processing and presentation.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Analysts and experts are involved.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
There are internal and external sources

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
and a single storage of information.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
The first task is partially solved

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
by integrating unstructured sources

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
with the help of corporate search engines.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
The search engine can index documents

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
and centralize access to them.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
In this case,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
the corporate search engine

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
is the entry point for all sources.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
The user can always get

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
a hint of where

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
a particular material is located.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
The second task of data extraction

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
is to be able to solve

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
data extraction with tools.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
These are classification,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
rubrication,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
data processing,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
so-called information extractors.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
It is possible to present

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
data, money, addresses

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
in a uniform way.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
As for the analysis tools,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
the third task,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
such tools as BI and Data Mining

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
allow not only to apply

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
standard analysis tools,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
but also to integrate information

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
from structured and unstructured sources.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
This is a three-component solution

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
of the search engine.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Such a three-component solution

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
of the search engine,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
data extraction and analysis tools

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
is an optimal technological combination

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
when solving business intelligence tasks.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Why is it so?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
This is discussed in detail

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
in the business case.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
You can see it in the textbook.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Let's stop here.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The existing systems

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
that automate the process

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
of search, extraction and analysis

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
allow to change the nature

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
of the analytical and expert's work.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
From the excavation of facts

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
to their verification and analysis.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
The most important thing is

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
to significantly increase

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
the processing speed of information.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
For comparison,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
if we take one article

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
with a size of 150-300 KB,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
an analyst can process

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
200 articles in one day,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
an expert-analyst 400,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
and the extraction technology,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
similar to the one described

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
in the textbook,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
can process 20,000 articles

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
in one single-process machine configuration.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So, the data is incomparable.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Thanks to business intelligence tools

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
our small corporation

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
can become a big one

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
if it can use

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
the key performance indicators

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
of KPI

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
in order to increase scalability.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Secondly,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
we can create the key performance indicators

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
of the corporate strategy

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and manage them.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
We can use them as a basis

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
for the cooperation between the corporations.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Thirdly,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
we can make individual settings

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
of the business analysis information panels,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
the so-called dashboards,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
that meet the needs of the individual employees

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
and the general strategy of the company.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Fourthly,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
we can use the working processes

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
of the subscription and compensation

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
of the employees of the corporation

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
during the course of these changes.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Fifthly,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
we can provide accountability

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
by studying the specific performance indicators.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
We can also get the necessary information

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
by creating free reports on the request.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
We can also distribute the information

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
of the analytical instruments

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
within the organization

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
via the Internet,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
which is very cheap.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It is easy to navigate the data

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
and extract it from various sources

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
using the most familiar terminology.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
It is also easy to understand

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
the characteristics of the company's activities

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
and to identify the business development trends

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
in real-time,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
thanks to the constant connection

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
to almost any data source

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
in the process of analysis.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Some enterprises

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
develop the ALAP solutions

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
with the help of their IT specialists,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
which are built on the existing

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
data databases,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
such as the MAP,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
or the Oracle.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
However,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
such BI systems

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
cannot be considered as full-fledged,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
because the business analytics blocks

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
in accounting systems,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
especially ERPs,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
cannot provide all the necessary information

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
in their own time.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Also, the analytical models

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
developed in these systems

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
often do not contain a complete set

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
of necessary analytical sections

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
and indicators,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
which is why

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
the announcements

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
of developers and vendors

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
such as Oracle,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Business Object, or Microsoft

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
have already appeared.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The release of specialized BI tools

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
for medium and small corporations

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
is shown on the slide.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
The price of such solutions

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
is approximately $1,000

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
per one workplace.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It is not that much money.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Such BI tools

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
are not designed for a specific business function

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
or a specific area.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
They are more like a setting

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
for an ERP system.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
In addition,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
the interface of such BI tools

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
allows to obtain data

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
not only in the form of tables,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
but also in the form of graphical data.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I mean, in a graphical way.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So, BI systems are especially relevant

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
for companies operating

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
in high competition

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
and high dynamics.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Their business is client-oriented.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
It usually includes

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
retail,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
experimental,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
pharmaceutical,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
banking, telecommunications,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
insurance, etc.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
The IT infrastructure

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
is usually well-developed

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
in the mentioned segments,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
which is undoubtedly an important factor

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
in the functioning of BI systems.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And, as a rule,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
developers and vendors

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
need to be able to assess

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
the events of the business

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
in a short time.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
They need to be able to manage

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
the business in a real time.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That's why

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
BI systems are an important

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
component

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
or a core

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
of their business.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
If a company

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
needs to find

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
an optimal solution

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
considering many factors

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
like raw materials quality,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
large batch load capacity,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
delay risk, payment deadline,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
delivery cost, etc.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Then this task requires

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
large amounts of calculations

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
and specially prepared data.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And you can't solve this task

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
with just accounting systems

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
or BI modules.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
For such problems,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
you need a special

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
BI system,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
which allows you to make

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
a decision with high accuracy

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
and high probability.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
In fact,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
this is one of the

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
undoubted advantages

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
of our SMB corporation

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
if managers

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
make a decision

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
about the introduction of BI systems.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Let's move on

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
to the next concept.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Workflow concept

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
and Enterprise Content Management

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
for electronic document processing systems.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Modern enterprise infrastructure

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
consists of many

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
interconnected subsystems

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
which represent

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
a wide range of activities

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and they meet

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
numerous requirements

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
for the entire

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
electronic document processing system.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
In particular,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
for the SET system.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
That's why

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
the use of SET systems

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
is based on

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
the organizational structure of the corporation,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
the direction and transparency

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
of the information flows

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
and the principles of accountability

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
adopted by the corporation.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
The important factors for SET

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
are the requirements

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
for tracking all stages

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
of the document lifecycle,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
its route,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
the introduction of protocols

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and the user's rights

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
to access the document.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
The slide shows

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
the place of the SET

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
in the typical

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
corporate information system

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
KIS.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
It includes

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
four key subsystems

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
namely

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
IT infrastructure management,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
ERP management,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
document and content management

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
and business analytics.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
The core of any

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
SET is

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
the workflow technology.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
The term workflow

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
is a term for the systems

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
aimed at the automation

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
of a large number of business processes

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
with a small weight.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
The workflow allows

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
to work with such business processes

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
as content,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
which is constantly

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
modified and supplemented.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
In our case,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
content is the term

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
of the content of the document

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
and the scenario of the document

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
can be reflected on the paper

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
or in the electronic form.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
The key feature

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
is the ability to work

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
with unstructured data.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
The workflow technology

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
is created with the help

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
of a graphical editor

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
of a random route scheme.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
The workflow technology

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
sets the transition rules

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
for the business processes

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
from one user to another

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
and also performs a formal monitoring

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
of the processes between users

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
with the possibility of

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
the distribution,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
the convergence,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
the investment

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
and other conditions

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
for the processing of the business process.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
The workflow technology

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
allows to make changes

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
and optimize any process

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
based on the analysis of its current state

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and at the same time

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
document the changes

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
that the user made

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
during the process.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
For example,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
one of the functions

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
of the workflow system

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
is the registration

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
of the actions of the document.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
For example,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
the document is accepted

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
to be executed

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
or transferred to the employee

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
or the document is given

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
a corresponding answer.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
These are the rules

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
for the registration of the document

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
by the organizational managers

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
and the preparation of the agreement,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
the signing of the agreement,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
the approval of the additional agreement,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
the registration,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
the cancellation of the archive.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
This scheme

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
is the core of

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
the workflow technology

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
that is adopted

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
in almost all

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and constitutes the core

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
of any electronic document

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
or any other electronic document

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
system.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
However, the further development

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
of the electronic document

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
is connected with the concept

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
of Enterprise Content Management

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
or ECM.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
The corporations have accumulated

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
a lot of documents,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
critical documents

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
that exist not only in electronic

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
but also in paper form

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
and they need a well-constructed

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
and interconnected system.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
The enterprise logic

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
was supported with simple

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and complex means,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
from the file system,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
to the electronic mail,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
to the specialized applications.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But the entire business logic

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
was contained in the minds

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
of people who served

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
as a kind of information

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and verification system

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
in any corporation.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
There are such employees

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
who you can contact

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and he will answer

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
a particular question.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Therefore, the ECM system

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
or Enterprise Content Management

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
is a kind of challenge

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
or an answer

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
when one person

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
is no longer able

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
to keep in mind

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
all the connections

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
and the entire business logic

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
of the organization.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
What is the ECM system?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
This concept unites

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
the technologies used

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
for processing unstructured information

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
related to the implementation

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
of certain organizational processes.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
The unstructured information

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
includes documents

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
as well as

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
the more general concept

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
of content,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
in particular,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
the information content

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
of the Internet sites

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
and other data storages.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
As a separate category,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
the information should be

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
stored in an unchanged form.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
In Russian,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
there is no such thing.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Maybe,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
usually records are characterized

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
as with archival data.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
What is the ECM system?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
The concept of Enterprise Content Management

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
unites all the technologies

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
related to the processing

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
of unstructured information.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
The concept of processing information

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
is explained as follows.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
The main function of the ECM system

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
is to store, manage,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
ensure integrity

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
and provide information.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Pay attention to the capture

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
and the digitization

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
of the flow

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
or the transition

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
from uncharged form

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
to uncharged form.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The concept of capturing

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
the data from external sources

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
to the information system

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
of the company

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
is a very important

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and important issue.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
The main problem

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
of the ECM system

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
is the fact

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
that the data

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
is automatically

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
transferred

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The main problem

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
of the ECM system

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
SimData

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
in its address book

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
defines the concept

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
of PLM as a technology

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
that unites the database

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and the application

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
that creates, manages

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
and distributes

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
information about the product

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
throughout its lifecycle.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
This concept includes

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
both the modeling of the product

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
and its technical design,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
production preparation,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
and the production of the product.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Thus, PLM takes on

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
a number of functions

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
of other corporate systems

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
such as SCM, CRM, ERP.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
The global market

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
is represented by

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
SAP PLM systems

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
and vendors

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
such as the American Autodesk,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
the French Dessault Systems,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
the American PTC

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and UGS.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
In addition to the automated

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
automation and

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
production optimization

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
systems, there are also

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
the mass systems

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
and the manufacturing

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
execution systems

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
that successfully reduce

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
production costs,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
increase volume

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
and improve the quality

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
of the product.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
The analysts point out

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
the possibility of saving

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
30-40% of the use

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
of the system.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
The three-part solution

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
of the pyramid

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
is the Fobos solution.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
There are other solutions,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
but they are not

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
as complex as the Fobos.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
The Fobos system

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
is used in a large machine

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
and usually with heavy ERP systems

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
such as BAN or SAP.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
The developers of this system

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
work on the possibility

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
of integrating the Fobos

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
into the Mesh system

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
with the 1S version 8.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
The slide shows the main systems

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
and developers

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
used in production

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
at Russian enterprises.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
We have considered

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
the main concepts

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
for the business

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
and the SMB corporation.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
These concepts describe

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
IT solutions and IT products

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
for B2B and B2C tasks.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
The corporation's functioning

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
is carried out

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
in a state-level

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
public environment

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
that is also subject

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
to IT.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
The last lecture

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
will be dedicated to IT solutions

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
and IT products for different

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
business processes.
