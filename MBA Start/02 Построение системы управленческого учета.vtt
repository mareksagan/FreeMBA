00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What is the role of the management of the company?

00:05.000 --> 00:16.000
After we have developed a list of key indicators and reports that we need to understand what is going on in the business,

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
we usually carry out financial structuring of our company.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
In the management accounting there is a concept of financial structure.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
It is a combination of the financial responsibilities centers, so-called CFOs, and so-called internal or transfer centers.

00:35.000 --> 00:47.000
In fact, we are trying to determine to what extent the structural divisions of the company are to blame in the size of individual articles, reports on profits and losses of the business as a whole.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
The costs, which we see in the reports on profits and losses, arise everywhere.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Accordingly, all structural subdivisions of the company are the centers of costs, because they have a certain budget,

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
and having signed it with blood, they promised to fit into this budget.

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
But it is clear that in addition to the fact that they must fit into the budget, they must ensure the achievement of some goals in terms of quality and time.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
But since some structural divisions, in addition to costs, also have income,

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
these structural divisions are not considered as the centers of costs, but as the centers of so-called gross income or as the centers of profits.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
Theoretically, the company can also be a so-called center of income, or centers of income.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
This does not mean that these structural divisions have no costs.

01:38.000 --> 01:49.000
It just means that they cannot actively influence any article.

01:49.000 --> 01:59.000
In one trading company, I was shown a financial structure in which the shops selling shoes are listed as the centers of income.

01:59.000 --> 02:07.000
According to the management, there is not a single article of costs that the head of the store and his employees could influence to some extent.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
That is, the store is already rented, the place is chosen, it is rented, there is a repair,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
which tile will be on the floor, the management of the store did not discuss it.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
The goods were purchased in China at the prices at which the central office decided to do it.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
The staff was hired and we set up a salary, which is approved by the manager on the staff.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
The manual was handed out in which everything was described in detail,

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
up to the indication of what kind of tree should be on the shop's shop window from October to February.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
In general, everything is explained in detail in the manual.

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
If the head of the store and his employees will follow this manual, these rules, this corporate standard, then their income will be large.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
If they do not follow it, then the income may be less.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
But they did not find a single article of costs that the store employee or the head of the store could influence.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
There is an article of theft, the loss of goods from the store.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
In this company, this is not an article of costs of the company, this is an article of costs of the staff.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
That is, all the loss of goods from the store is from the personal pocket of the employees who work in the store.

03:21.000 --> 03:31.000
But arguing with the management of the company, it can be assumed that the store employees can accidentally or deliberately touch the glass cabinet in the store,

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
on which there are shoes. The glass cabinet will fall, the glass will break and additional costs will arise for this store.

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
It seems to me that to some extent, the structural division in which some income arises can always influence its costs.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
In my understanding, this store should be the center of the shaft income.

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
The center of the shaft income, as we see in this slide, is a structural division through which we monitor its income and direct costs.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
That is, those that arise in this center of financial responsibility.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
For some part of the article of costs, it can be responsible, actively influencing it.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
For some part, it is not. But these are so-called direct uncontrolled costs.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
These are the costs that can be attributed to this division, because they arose there.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
But due to a number of reasons, this structural division does not manage the costs in any way.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
They are managed by someone up there, some kind of corporate center, but not a structural division.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
If we designate a particular division of the company as the center of profit,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
this means that the degree of impact on the costs is quite large.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
The structural division manages both its direct costs and the size of indirect costs,

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
general corporate costs that came to this structural division from some corporate center.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Usually, the centers of profit exist in divisional organizations,

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
when there is a management company or some kind of corporate center and a relatively independent business unit.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
We can calculate the income of this division of the shaft, the revenue minus the direct costs,

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
and then break the corporate orange, tangerine or grapefruit.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
You understand that the size of the fruits is different.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
This is the size of the general corporate costs, which we then divide into these centers of profit.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
To evaluate them not by the shaft income, but by the final financial result, by the profit.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
We will talk about the methods of division of oranges, tangerines, and grapefruits later.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
It is important to understand that the center of profit differs from the center of shaft income

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
because the results of its work are evaluated by the final financial result.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
After we have put some part of the general corporate costs on this division,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
and most likely it actively participated in this process,

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
most likely it was invited to discuss the budgets of the corporate center,

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
and discuss the methods by which the costs of the corporate center will be distributed between the divisions.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
The financial structure usually involves the use of so-called internal prices.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
In the management account, they are also called transfer.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
I would like to dwell on this in more detail and discuss a number of examples of the use of internal prices

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
in the companies of the most different industries, between the most different structural divisions.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
The first example is the relationship between the production division and the division that deals with the marketing and sales.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
The main element of the financial structure of the company is the so-called internal or transfer prices.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
There are several examples on this slide, each of which I want to tell in more detail.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
We will discuss the problems of the internal price between the production and the household,

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
divisions between two production structures,

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
when one production passes its product to another production at a certain internal price.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
The third case is the relationship between the transport service and the trading within the company.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
The fourth case is the purchase and production.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
The fifth case is when we have a corporate center, which includes several internal services,

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
for example, IT, accounting, corporate, corporate business, corporate HR, corporate HR,

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
and these four internal services provide internal services to each other,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
as well as to individual business units, A, B and C.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
And the last situation is when the business units themselves are in some internal trade.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
The A division sells something to external customers,

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
and also sells the same thing to internal customers of the B division within the same holding.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
So, the first example is here on the flip chart.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Two companies that have faced the same problem.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
What should be the price at which the product from the production CFO of the financial responsibility center

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
will be moved to the household CFO of the household financial responsibility center?

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
That is, there is a production site that, at a certain internal accounting price,

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
transfers the product of its labor to the service that deals with marketing and sales.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
The question is at what price.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Let's assume that in the first case we are talking about the issue of office furniture.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
The financial director offers the following scheme.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
He offers the production CFO, under the strictest control of the administration,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
to calculate its material costs.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
That is, when an order comes to the production site for a certain collection of furniture,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
the production must calculate its material costs.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
How much material will be spent.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Moreover, the message is as follows.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
The material costs in this company are already almost optimized.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
That is, discounts for all suppliers have already been knocked out,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
the share of marriage is almost zero, there are very few expenses.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
In general, the cost of materials is worked out almost 100%.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And under the control of the financial director,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
the manufacturers calculate their material costs.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Here they are.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
After that, the financial director allows them to multiply the material costs by 2.5.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
For example, 2.5.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
And in the end, the internal price is obtained.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Here it is.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Blue.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
The cost of materials is multiplied by a coefficient of 2.5.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
No matter what happens, the collection of furniture will follow from this CFO to this CFO.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
But what, in addition to the materials, does this price include?

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
The price also includes the salary.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Here it is.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
This is the salary.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
In addition to the materials.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
And it also includes other production costs.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I will write here the salary.

09:56.000 --> 10:06.000
Here I will write the other production costs.

10:06.000 --> 10:15.000
This is electricity consumption, repair, maintenance of equipment, lighting, heating, amortization.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
In general, all the costs that occur in production.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
We see that if in this period the production is processed with such costs,

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
then the balance of this unit is registered by the financial director.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Here it is.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
This is the profit.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
By subtracting the actual costs from the calculated internal price,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
the price is formed according to the scheme of the cost of materials, multiplied by 2.5.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
What happens to this profit?

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Let's say the size of this profit is not very small,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
and the production worked well,

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
therefore, 20% of this amount, the financial director allows you to spend on beer.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
That is, as an additional bonus to the salary.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
You can't spend everything on beer, because you need to think about tomorrow.

11:08.000 --> 11:17.000
80% of this margin goes to the production reserve fund.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
80% of this margin goes to the production reserve fund.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
What kind of fund?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
It is necessary to periodically update the equipment,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
periodically do repairs, paint the walls, and so on.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
80% goes to the development of production.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
If in the next period the production works worse,

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
the other production costs are already such,

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
then on the balance sheet of the production, the financial director registers the profit again.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
But this profit is already smaller.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Since it is small, only 2% of the margin for beer,

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
and 98% of the small margin goes to the production reserve fund.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
Maybe the period when the other production costs will be like this.

12:12.000 --> 12:22.000
Everything coincided with the amount that we calculated by multiplying the material costs by 2.5%.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
The margin for the production reserve fund is fixed at 0.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
There is nothing for beer, nothing for development.

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
And the worst situation is when the production is processed with steel production costs equal to this value.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
I think you guessed that the marketing of the products takes the product at this price.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
By the math of costs, multiplied by 2.5.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
This value is registered on the balance sheet of the production as a loss.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And after that, the stage of the analysis of flights begins.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
It is clear that it is necessary to analyze why this negative margin arose.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Because of their inefficiency or force majeure.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
How can the matter end?

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
From a light and suffocating conversation in the office of the general director to dismissal.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
But the marketing of the products does not suffer.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
You understand that he takes the collection of furniture for production at the agreed price.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
The margin for the production is multiplied by 2.5%.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
It can be assumed that in this scheme, in the interests of the manufacturers,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
blow up the material costs and then multiply them by 2.5%.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
But no one will let them do this, because the material costs are calculated under the control of the financial director.

13:40.000 --> 13:48.000
I can't say that the scheme is universal for everyone, but in certain companies it will be good.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
The second business is the same problem.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
The relationship between production and the service of marketing of the products is not furniture, but paint.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
A newly created enterprise, a newly created platform,

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
consists of a fairly large international concern with an office in Germany.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
The Germans in the central office report that the production site forms the following price for the production structures.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
This is the raw material plus 9 euros in the account for the tone.

14:20.000 --> 14:30.000
If you enter 9 euros in the account for the tone, you can add 7% to this amount.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
This will be the price at which the production, which makes the paint,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
transfers this paint to the marketing department of the S&B.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
Since the newly created company does not have all the necessary competencies,

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
does not understand the kitchen yet, does not understand how the gears are connected to each other,

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
at the first stages it can turn out that a large amount of money is spent on mixing paint in barrels,

14:54.000 --> 15:06.000
and in the account for the tone it turned out to be 12 euros, sometimes 11 euros.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
But the company has gradually reached the level of 9 euros per tone, as it was brought in from Germany.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
These are all costs that arise in production without taking into account the raw materials.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
They all have to fall into the norm, 9 euros per tone.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
As soon as the company falls into this norm, it counts the maximum costs,

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
plus 9 euros per tone, and adds 7% to this amount of its internal margin,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
as a bonus to the premium fund.

15:39.000 --> 15:48.000
We understand that until it has learned to do this, it still transfers its product to the production structures at what price?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Raw materials plus 9 euros per tone.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
This amount is recorded as its loss.

15:54.000 --> 16:04.000
These are two examples of the relationship between the production piece of the business and the part that deals with marketing and sales.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
The second example is the relationship between two production companies.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
The company is the same inside, the company is the same legal entity.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
The territory between the hangars is 30 meters.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
This hangar specializes in the production of windows, a wooden window at the exit.

16:23.000 --> 16:31.000
This is a kind of a pre-building to it, another hangar, in which a log is fed to the entrance,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
the log is cut into boards, this is a sawing section.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
Then the boards are dried on a drying site, and then a glued log is made of the dried boards.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
A glued log is a semi-finished product that is used to make windows, but it can be sold to the side.

16:47.000 --> 16:57.000
Initially, the company was created to make windows, and this was considered as a supporting production unit.

16:57.000 --> 17:05.000
But over time, employees who work in this unit realized that they can squeeze more from the available capacities.

17:05.000 --> 17:14.000
Their results are consumed in this unit, and they can fully meet the needs of this production.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
In addition, they can sell some additional volume to the side.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
On average, the picture is as follows.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
70% of the volume of the glued log is consumed here, and 30% is sold to external customers.

17:30.000 --> 17:39.000
The prices on the market are approximately 49.5-50.5 conditional cash marks.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
We consider the economy, we consider the cost.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
The accounting service, having calculated all the costs in this production hangar,

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
and dividing it by the number of cubic meters, gets 40 conditional cash marks per cubic meter.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
This is the production cost of one cubic meter of glued log, the final product of this hangar.

18:05.000 --> 18:13.000
The company also has an administration, IT people, security service, accounting, deputy director of organizational development, etc.

18:13.000 --> 18:25.000
They cost money, and by some cunning calculations, we add 3 conditional cash marks to the production cost.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
This is the production cost, and this is the administrative cost added to the production cost.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
In addition, the company also has a marketing service, and there are also some costs.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
And from the total amount, we add 2 U of conditional cash marks to the glued log.

18:43.000 --> 18:50.000
In total, we get the full cost of a cubic meter of glued log, which is equal to 45 conditional cash marks.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
So, the production cost is 40, the total cost is 45, taking into account the administration,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
and taking into account the fact that it must be reached for the maintenance of the marketing service.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
The question arises, how much does it cost in the internal accounting?

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
One cubic meter of glued log will move from this CFO to another.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
Why are we doing this? In order to assess the economic efficiency of structural units.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
No one prevents us from building a small program in Microsoft Excel in the accounting,

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
and to drive the glued log here, into the window, at the average market price,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
which is equal to 49.5-50.5.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
But at the same time, we can take into account a number of other factors.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
The fact that they can drink among themselves at one corporate party,

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
I think, is not necessary to be taken into account here.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
What factor should be taken into account here?

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
The fact that this CFO is a large, permanent client.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
This unit here regularly takes 70% of the total volume, and does it regularly.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Therefore, it may require a discount to a large, permanent client.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
In my opinion, we here should sell the glued log for 49.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
Why 49? We are pushing the average price on the market for such a product,

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
but taking into account other factors, namely, a discount to a large, permanent client.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
This is done in order to assess the economic efficiency of this structural unit.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
We believe that the efficiency of the company as a whole

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
is based on the efficiency of the work of individual structural units.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Sometimes the question arises, will the windows not turn golden,

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
if each alteration in the composition of this chain will add a margin?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
No, it will not.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
I, as a client who buys a window here, do not care how they share the overall margin of the company by alterations.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
They will generate a margin at the end of the chain,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
or some piece of margin here, here, here, here, here.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I, as a client, do not care.

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
We are talking about how we share the overall margin of the company by alterations.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
It may be that some of the company's units are profitable,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
or some are very profitable, but we must understand this.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
What does the picture look like in our business at some point in time?

21:08.000 --> 21:15.000
Another example of this, of the relationship between two production structures, will be on the next diagram.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Another example on this topic,

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
the relationship between two production structures in the same business.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
But here is a small nuance, two different lawyers,

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
and we know that internal transfer prices are sometimes used to optimize some tax schemes.

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
Here, again, is an attempt to assess the economic efficiency of two structural units.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
In this diagram, we see that we are talking about the production of a car.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
The car is produced here at the factory, at the assembly plant,

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
where all the necessary components arrive, which are then connected to the finished product, called a car.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
There are external suppliers, and there is an internal supplier, which is part of the concern.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
At this factory, the engine is produced.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
This engine comes here, it arrives, as agreed, at 8.32,

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
and the engine completely suits this internal client in terms of quality,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
in terms of certain characteristics of the engine quality.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
That is, at two angles of three, we put a plus,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
we are completely satisfied with the terms as an internal client,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
and we are completely satisfied with the quality.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
But the third angle of expenditure is a question.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
This structural unit has to pay an internal price

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
that exceeds the price of external potential suppliers by some percentage.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
This part of the company went to the stores.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
Here is a supplier, here is a supplier, here is a supplier, and here is a supplier,

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
who are ready to supply at 8.32,

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
ready to supply the product of the level of quality that is needed here,

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
and ready to supply it at a price less than the costs that arise here.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Having learned about this situation, the factory number two

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
appeals to the administration with the following proposal.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
Allow them to buy on the side, because the internal price is too high.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
They do not want to receive a lower salary, a lower profit,

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
a lower bonus from the profit, paying for the inefficiency of this first factory.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
In Germany, there is a proverb, in Russian it sounds like this,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
that you can eat outside, but you have to eat at home.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
This is what the administration said to this second factory,

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
but with a condition that this principle will apply for the next 365 days.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
If after 365 days the administration and the factory number one

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
do not find ways to reduce the price of the engine,

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
that is, after 365 days, this unit will be officially allowed to buy it on the side.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
If he, as a process manager, takes responsibility for the overall characteristics of the car.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
But in this company, the situation was corrected,

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
and after 365 days, the factory number two remained,

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
because he was able to reduce the price of the engine

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
and at the same level to make his product cheaper

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
and satisfy the internal customer in all three corners,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
the cost and time of quality.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
The next example is the relationship between the purchasing structures and the production structures.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Imagine that we are talking about a construction company,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
which consists of three brigades that work on different objects,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
performing construction and installation work.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
There is a central material and technical supply base,

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
on which these brigades order the materials they need to perform work next week.

25:12.000 --> 25:20.000
The material and technical supply base believes that all orders should be made before 11.30 on Thursday,

25:20.000 --> 25:27.000
so that it is convenient for it to buy everything in a slow mode.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
The brigades do not see any problems in submitting an application after lunch on Thursday and after lunch on Friday,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
and want the base to be able to buy everything,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
so that on Monday they have a bag of cement on the site.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
There is a conflict in the company,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
with their arguments the base goes to the management,

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
and with their arguments the brigades go to the management.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
Having listened to both sides, the management came up with a scheme,

25:54.000 --> 26:01.000
as a result of which the position of the material and technical supply base changed radically.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It began to say,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Dear internal clients,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I am already at work on Saturday from 8 am to 10 pm,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
ready to accept your orders.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
If you order something from me on Saturday,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
then on Monday it will be on your site.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
The scheme is based on the fact that an internal price was introduced,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
tied to time.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That is, the price for resources,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
if they submit an application on Wednesday and before lunch on Thursday,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
is the smallest,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and this is in the interests of the brigades.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
If they can implement their planning in such a way

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
to submit applications in advance,

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
they can take the resource at a minimum price.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
If they do not have time to submit an application after lunch on Thursday,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
or after lunch on Friday,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
or on Saturday,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
then the prices are higher.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
This is the first element of the scheme.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
The second element of the scheme is based on the statement,

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
that the authorities are absolutely corrupt.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Therefore, the management of the company considers it reasonable

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
to create another structural division called the procurement.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
This is procurement number 2,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
and this is procurement number 1.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
The second structure, which deals with procurement,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
appears in the company.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
These three brigades have the option of choice.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
They can buy a resource on this basis,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and on this basis,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
which, in principle, competes with each other.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Can they agree with each other?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Probably yes.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
There is a possibility of this.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Nevertheless, the scheme we see here

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
assumes that the prices for internal resources are tied to time,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
and the brigade has the option of choosing

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
whether to apply for procurement number 1

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
or procurement number 2.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
The next example is the relationship

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
between the transport structure and the shops

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
within the trading company.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
This transport service within the company

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
was either inside or outsourcing,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
then again inside, then again outsourcing.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
And the last decision of the financial director

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
is to pay the transport service a fixed percentage of the revenue,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
and how it will be spent,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
this is already the business of the transport service.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
As a result, the financial director began to notice the following.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
The transport service began to buy trailers,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
because from point A to point B

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
you can just drag a truck,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
or you can take a truck with a trailer.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
If you take a truck with a trailer, it turns out cheaper.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
The transport service began to use

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
so-called vertical pallets,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
because it fits more than the horizontal pallets of the product.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
And the transport service also bought software

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
in order to plan its transport routes,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
and spend less.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
If it spends less,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
it will earn internal profit,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
which it will spend on its own needs.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
The next example of the use of internal prices

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
is the relationship between the divisions

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
within the holding

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
and the services of the managing company,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
which sells, in fact, the internal service.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
But imagine that we are talking about the IT department,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
which serves internal clients.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
The divisions themselves act as internal clients,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
and some other services of the corporate center,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
such as accounting,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
the department of controlling,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
the service of managing personnel, and so on.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
In this case,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
you can use a methodology

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
based on the chronometering of working time.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
As a rule,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
this is without extra fanaticism,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
without a stopwatch,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
but in the large cell we can understand

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
how much time

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
the IT department spends

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
for a certain month

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
during the first half of the year

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
on the needs of internal clients.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
After this analytical work,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
we get the following figures.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
The IT department spends

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
an average of 20% of its time

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
on this internal client,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
on this division.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
This department spends 10%

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
and this department spends 10%.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
The internal clients

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
of the corporate center

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
spend 5% of their time on the managers,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
5% on the IT department,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
5% on the department of controlling,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
10% on the accounting,

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
and 20% on the rest of the internal clients.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
But if we add all this up,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
we get 80%.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
So where is the other 20%

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
of the total IT department's time?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
These are general corporate needs,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
for example,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
installing filters

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
that do not allow viruses into the company,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
monitoring and managing

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
the corporate website,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
participating in tenders

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
for the purchase of ERP systems,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
or improving the qualifications.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
But what does this method suggest?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
It suggests

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
the distribution of all costs

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
in the IT department

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
by these three divisions.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Because it will go on

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
to the product portfolio

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
of business unit A,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
to the product portfolio of business unit B,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and we will distribute

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
a certain percentage of IT department's costs

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
in a very reasonable way,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
in proportion to the time.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And the rest will come to the load

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
in the form of the so-called subscription fee.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
This method is quite expensive

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
from the point of view of operation,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
but it allows you to make

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
a very reasonable share of costs.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
My experience suggests

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
that, in principle,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
this can be done once every six months.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
For six months,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
you can not return to these percentages,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
and after the first six months,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
the session can be reviewed

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
a little bit,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
so that they are fixed again

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
for the next six months.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Another example of internal costs.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
This time, the relationship

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
between the structural units

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
within the company

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
is built on the division principle.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
That is, there is an administration,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
there are three relatively

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
independent business units.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
They are related to each other,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
and they work with external clients.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
After a while,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
their own bank appears in the company,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
a separate business unit,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
which works with external clients

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
by 12-13 percent.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
This is money for the market,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
it is sold to external clients.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And this is how

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
the management of the company

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
works with external clients.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
And this is how

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
the management of the company

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
works with external clients.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
And these three structures

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
are used by the management of the company.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
If you need money,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
please buy it in your bank,

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
and you will pay

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
this percentage.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
That is, the bank sells

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
money to its colleagues

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
more expensively

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
than to external clients.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
What are the reasons?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Maybe there is some kind of tax scheme,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
maybe not.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
But if we do not touch this topic,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
then what are the other reasons?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
For example, the desire of the management

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
of the company to support

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
young business units at the first stages.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
These are the older brothers and sisters,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
and this is the younger one,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
who is still small,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
and in order for him to become stronger,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
he needs to be helped,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
he needs to be fed.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Or what is the reason?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
When we send money to some external banks,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
we have to prepare a lot of documents,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
business plans, get ratings,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
create an accounting with MSFO,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
and so on.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
And when we send money to our own bank,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
we get money quickly,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
but we have to pay for it.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
So the internal price

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
is a fairly broad concept.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
It can be the equal price

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
of the costs in this unit.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
This price can be higher

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
than the costs in this unit.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
But, as a rule,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
when we generate an internal price,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
we rely on market prices,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
on comparable goods,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
on comparable services in the market.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And the main purpose of all these schemes

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
is to evaluate the economic efficiency

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
of the structural unit.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
We can do this only after we drive

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
resources into this structural unit

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
at a market price,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
or sell the product

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
at a price comparable to the average.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
And this is the main goal.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
You have an example in your report

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
of the financial structure

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
of a company that produces bicycles.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I would like to give a small comment

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
to this example.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
How do these figures

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
that we see in this table work?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Imagine that the company

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
was cut into parts

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
and made into two groups of CFO.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Two sub-units

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
fell into the service category.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
This is a repair unit,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
and the second sub-unit

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
fell into the service category.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
This is a repair service and a transport service.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
And five sub-units

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
fell into the main category of CFO.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
This is a warehouse,

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
workshop number one,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
where parts for bicycles are produced,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
workshop number two,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
where ready-made products are assembled,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
the company's administration,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
and the structure dealing with the product.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
What is the difference

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
between the main and the service CFO?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
The service CFO sells its product

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
to the main CFO.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
The main CFO

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
adds the costs

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
received from the service CFO

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
to the costs of the main CFO.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
The main CFO gets the total cost

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
and then divides it

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
by the product portfolio.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
The product portfolio of the company

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
is quite simple.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
There are standard bicycles

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and luxury bicycles.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
The product portfolio

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
consists of two products.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Let's look at the table

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
on this slide.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
We see that

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
the company

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
has

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
divided the costs

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
by the structural sub-units.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
The company has

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
material costs and

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
the product portfolio.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
These are two articles

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
that can be attributed

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
to these two products.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
The material costs

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
can be seen in the product portfolio.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The total amount of material costs

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
is 118,000

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
at the business level.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
The product salary

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
is 90,000.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
We see that some of the materials

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
were used in the workshop

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
where the parts were made,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
and some in the workshop

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
where the assembly was made.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
All other articles of costs

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
are indirect.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
We see that

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
the material costs are

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
the electricity used in the company,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
the insurance payments,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
the amortization of some

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
basic means,

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
and other articles.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
These articles of costs

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
are listed in the first column

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
of articles 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
We need to look

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
at these articles of costs

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
in the CFO.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
We see it in the lines

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
3-7.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
We see how much

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
the repair service costs,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
the transport service,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
the warehouse,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
the workshop 1, the workshop 2,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
and the administration of sales.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
We see it in the line 8.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
These are the initial costs

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
of structural components.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
The initial costs are the costs

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
that were initially generated.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
After that, in the lines 9 and 10,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
we see the internal distribution

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
of the costs of the repair service

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
and the transport service

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
by the internal clients,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
that is, by the main CFO.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
First, let's look at the repair service.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
The repair service costs the company

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
28,000 conditional cash marks.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
This is the sum of the salary

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
and all other articles of costs

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
that have arisen in the repair unit

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
during this period.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
On some basis,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
for example, it can be the repair of the watch,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
we distributed these 28,000

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
to the transport service,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
and all other costs went to the main CFO,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
to the warehouse, to the workshop 1,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
to the second, to the administration, to the sales.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
At the second stage,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
we distribute the costs of the transport service.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Initially, there were costs

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
equal to 15,000,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
but given that the repair workers

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
visited the transport service,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
1,000 of the costs

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
that arose in the repair service

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
are added, we divide it by 16,000.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
On some basis, the costs of the transport service

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
are distributed among the internal clients.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Between the warehouse,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
the workshop 1, the workshop 2, the administration, and the sales.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
It is assumed that

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
all departments

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
used the services of the transport service.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
If someone did not use it,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
then there will be 0 in this cell.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And after that,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
in the 11th line,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
we see how much the warehouse costs,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
the workshop 1, the workshop 2, the administration, and the sales,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
given that they bought

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
repair services and transport

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
services,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
these are the so-called primary

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
plus secondary costs.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
The secondary costs are bought on the internal market.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
After that,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
the total amount of costs

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
that arose in the warehouse,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
in the first workshop, in the second workshop,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
in the administration, and in the sales,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
we must divide

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
by the product portfolio.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
That is, the costs of the warehouse are divided

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
between the standard bicycles

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
and the luxury class bicycles.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
The costs of the first workshop, the costs of the second,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
the administration, and the sales must also be divided

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
into two parts.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Some part will fall on the standard bicycles,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
and some on the luxury.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
We want this base,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
the distribution base, to be

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
inexpensive and very adequate.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Usually, there are not so many

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
such bases,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
most of them are either expensive in terms of operation

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
or not very adequate.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
The more expensive the base, the more adequate it is,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
and vice versa.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
In this example, we see that the financial director

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
of the company is going to divide the costs

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
that arose in the warehouse

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
35,400

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
by the product portfolio

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
proportional to the costs.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
The more expensive the bicycles

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
are in terms of material costs,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
the more they will be spent

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
on the warehouse.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
If the luxury bicycle is made of gold

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
and platinum, then the lion's share

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
of the costs that arose in the warehouse

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
will be spent on the luxury bicycle.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
The base may not be very adequate,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
but it is inexpensive.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
The first and the second workshops

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
will divide their costs

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
in the product portfolio

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
proportional to the total salary

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
paid in the workshop.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
The administration and the sales

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
will divide their costs

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
in the product portfolio

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
proportional to the total production cost.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
We must calculate

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
the direct costs,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
i.e. the material and the product salary,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
and add up the costs

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
that arose in the warehouse

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
in the first and the second workshops.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
We will get the total production cost.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
We will know how much it is

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
in terms of standard and luxury,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
and in this proportion

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
we will divide the costs of the administration and sales.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
In the last line

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
of this table,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
we see the calculation of the so-called

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
indirect costs.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
It is obtained by dividing the line 11,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
i.e. the costs that are to be divided,

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
into the size of the distribution base.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Each time it is different.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
In the case of the warehouse,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
the size of the distribution base

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
is the direct cost.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
In the case of the first workshop,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
it is the total salary of this workshop.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
In the case of the second workshop,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
it is the total salary of this workshop.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And in the case of the administration and sales,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
we said that

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
the distribution base is the total production cost.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
How to calculate it?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
It is very simple.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
We need to add up the materials,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
the total salary,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
and the costs that arose in the warehouse,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
in the first and the second workshops.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
These are the three workshops

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
related to the production sector.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
After that,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
we will calculate the additional costs

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
that are used in the system of calculation.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
It seems to me that

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
this kind of work will be useful

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
for any business.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
To get such a table,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
you need to divide your business

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
into CFOs,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
form a group of main CFOs,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
these are the structures that

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
will divide their costs

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
directly into the product portfolio.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
And a group of service CFOs,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
these are the departments that will sell

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
their services to internal clients

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
at a certain price.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
In this case, we see that the price is equal to the cost.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
This is a private case,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
but it is possible.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
But there are two questions here.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
What should be the distribution base

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
of the costs of the service CFOs

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
per main CFO,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
and what should be the distribution base

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
of the costs of the main CFOs

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
per product portfolio?

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The next very important section

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
of the accounting management system

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
in the company is accounting policy.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Accounting policy is the collection

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
of basic rules,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
canons,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
principles, instructions

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
on the calculation of certain figures

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
in the balance of the account

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
of the product portfolio.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
The main policy of the company

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
is to collect the main rules

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
and the main principles

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
of the accounting system.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
We will discuss the main principles

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
of accounting policy

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
in the next section.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
We will start with the money.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
In the usual accounting policy,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
it is important to talk about

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
how we treat the money transfer.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Our branch in the city of X

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
sent money to the central office.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
It seems like it was sent,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
but it was not sent.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
It was sent to the central office

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
and it was not sent.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
It was sent to the central office

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
and it was not sent.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
It seems like it was sent,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
but it was not sent.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
The second situation is that

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
the client in the city of X

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
sent us money,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
but it was not sent to the central office.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
The first situation is

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
the money transfer

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
to the general amount of money.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
The second situation is

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
the debt of the debitor.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
If we read the International Standard

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
of Financial Accounting,

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
it is an idea like the equivalents

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
of money.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
These are high-liquid securities.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
If we have them,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
we are sure that we can

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
quickly convert them into real money.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
MSFO recommends

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
to add them to real money.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Another point is the exchange rate.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
The company can have

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
a lot of currencies.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
It is important to think about

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
the exchange rate

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
of the currency

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
of the management account.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Such things are usually discussed

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
in accounting policy

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
on money.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Next, the financial investment.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
It is the next position

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
in the management balance.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
The company can have financial investments

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
and it is important to understand

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
the entry price

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
at which it appears in the balance.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
For example, we bought

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
100 shares of a company

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
at a certain price,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
100 euros,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
and we paid 20 euros

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
of additional expenses

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
to the agents

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
who helped us to buy the shares.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Then the shares

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
that are in the balance

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
change their price.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
In September,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
the exchange rate of the company

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
we bought the shares was 99,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
then it dropped to 98 in October,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
then it rose sharply to 103,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
then it dropped to 101 euros.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
We have to write in the accounting policy

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
how we deal with all this

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
in the management account.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
As for the additional expenses

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
that we incur

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
when buying securities,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
most likely they do not appear in the balance,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
they appear in the balance of profits and losses

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
of the period in which we bought it.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
In the balance, securities

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
are inserted at the purchase price.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And then, when the exchange rate changes,

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
we follow it and choose

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
the exchange rate for the end of the month,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
or we choose the smallest of the two.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
The price of the purchase of securities

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
or the exchange rate for a specific date.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
If we follow the principles of pessimism,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
this is a very important principle

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
when evaluating assets,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
then we must evaluate

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
our financial investments

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
at the smallest of the two,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
the price of the purchase,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
or the current exchange rate.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Accordingly, if the price of the purchase

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
was 100 euros,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
and if we bought

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
the current exchange rate of 97 euros,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
then we multiply 97

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
by the number of shares,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
because it is less than the price of the purchase.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Next, the debitory debt.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
It is very important

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
to think about the reserve

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
for a hopeless and dubious

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
debitory debt in the company.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
For these purposes, it is usually recommended

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
to divide the debitory debt into separate types,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
for example, by age or geography,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
and to form,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
based on the statistics of previous periods,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
a reserve for a hopeless

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
and dubious debitory debt

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
of each type.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
The older the debitory, the more the reserve.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
You can subtract these amounts

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
from the amount of the debitory

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
and send it to the account of profits and losses

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
and other expenses.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
In the balance, the debitory

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
will hang in the management account

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
already below the minus of the percentage

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
of hopeless or dubious debts.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Some companies evaluate their debitory

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
at the factoring price,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
that is, at the price at which

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
the debitory debt can be sold to the bank.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
The principle here is simple.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Any asset costs as much

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
as it can be sold.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Accordingly, the debitory costs as much

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
as it can be sold to the bank.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Another very important point

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
about the debitory is the so-called

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
ABC classification.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Recalling the Pareto principle,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
we can assume that

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
80% of the total

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
amount of the debitory debt

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
is 20% of the total

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
amount of the debitory debt

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
from the long list.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
The rest of the debt

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
is 20%

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
of the total

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
amount of the debitory debt

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
from the long list of 80% of the debitory debt.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
This principle is very useful

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
when making management reports

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
on the same debitory.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
We show the leadership

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
most likely group A in full list,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
and group B and C

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
in the folded form

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
of the total amount.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Next, the advance payments.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
The company can issue advance payments,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
and, accordingly, the question arises

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
how to take them into account in the management report.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
If the company has a problem

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
that we issued some amount of money

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
to the supplier in the form of an advance payment,

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
he sent the goods to me,

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
but we still managed to return the money.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
But the money today and the money the day after

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
are different money,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
and the company has a concept of the cost of money in time.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Accordingly, if the company

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
periodically has such problems,

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
then it must provide a reserve

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
for the aging of the money

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
in the advance payments.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
We still manage to get the money,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
but there is a concept of the cost of money in time,

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
and the money that we got from the supplier

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
90 days later is no longer equal to today's money.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
The money was lost in the price,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
and the reserve for the depreciation of money

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
in the advance payments

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
is useful in the management report.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
The next section of the balance sheet is the reserves.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Let's assume that we are dealing

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
with a production company.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
In a production company,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
there are three types of reserves.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
These are raw materials and components,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
unfinished production,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
and ready-made production.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
In accounting, it is important to talk

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
about the reserves of raw materials

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
and components, the input price,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
and the price at which it appears in the balance sheet.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
This can be the price of acquisition

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
plus regular logistical costs.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
We should not put it into balance

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
irregular, some extreme events

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
at the customs, or in the process of transportation

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
some extreme events occurred.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
We should not put it into balance.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
We should take this into account

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
in the period in which

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
we paid these extreme expenses.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
The consumption standards of resources

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
are an important point

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
that is important to think about

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
in accounting.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
The order of writing resources

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
from the production warehouses.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
There are several schemes.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
There is a so-called FIFO scheme.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
It is First In First Out.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The first to be written off

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
is what came to the warehouse first.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
The reverse procedure is called LIFO.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Last In First Out.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
The first to be taken from the warehouse

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
is what came to the warehouse last.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
There are two methods

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
related to the price of acquisition.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
They are called HIFO and LOFO.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
HIFO is Highest In First Out.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
The first to be written off

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
is what was bought at the most expensive price.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
The reverse scheme is LOFO.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Lost In First Out.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
The first to be written off

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
is what was bought at the cheapest price.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
There is an option

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
that the first to be taken from the warehouse

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
is what came closest

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
to the expiration of the expiration date.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
And as an option,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
there is an average scheme.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
We consider the average option.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
All these options are possible.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
It is just important to understand

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
which of these options

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
will be acceptable to us.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
In international financial reports,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
it is recommended to use either FIFO,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
that is, the first to come and the first to leave,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
or the average option.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Another important point

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
is the inventory of stocks in the warehouse

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
and, accordingly, re-evaluation of

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
problematic positions and non-liquids.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
If something is not in the warehouse

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
or if something in the warehouse

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
has lost its properties

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
completely or partially,

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
or simply went out of fashion,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
or was simply bought for the product

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
that was already removed from production,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
it will most likely be evaluated as a non-liquid,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
and the price for this non-liquid

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
may be less than the price

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
at which it was bought.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Accordingly, the management account

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
will hang at the price at which we can sell

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
if it is less than the price

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
at which it was bought.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Another important point

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
is the resources in the warehouse,

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
but there are no necessary papers

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
that confirm the fact of purchase.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Either there are no stamps,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
or there are no signatures.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
But in the management account,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
we remember that the principle of priority

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
over the form works.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Accordingly, the paper is not so important,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
the fact of having resources in the warehouse

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
is important.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Further, the stock of unfinished production.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
It is very important to think

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
that the article of costs included

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
in the base assessment of the stocks

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
of unfinished production is not included.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
If you read the International Financial Report

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
it is recommended to assess

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
the unfinished product lying in the warehouse

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
according to the production costs,

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
exclusively according to the production costs.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
That is, not a single euro-value,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
the costs incurred in the administration

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
or in the service of marketing and sales

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
should not participate

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
in the assessment of the stocks

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
of unfinished production.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
And the finished product, by the way,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
which should also be taken into account

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
according to the production costs.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
If everything is fine with it,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
if something is wrong with it,

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
then it is usually recommended

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
to choose the least of the two,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
the production cost or the price

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
of the possible implementation.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
If we can sell the finished product

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
lying in the warehouse at a price

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
lower than the production cost,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
not to mention the full one,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
then we should assess this finished product

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
according to the price of the implementation.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
The least of the two.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
The production cost and the price of the implementation.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
As for the unfinished production,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
imagine that we are talking about windows.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
At the entrance we have quite nice boards,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
quite nice furniture,

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
quite nice glass.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
At the exit we have a quite nice window.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
The unfinished production

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
is basically wood.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
A little stained with paint

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
pieces of wood,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
somehow connected together.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
In principle, the buyer

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
probably cannot find anything

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
like that.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
If we are going to finish this order further,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
then we assess it

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
according to the production cost.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
However, if we do not finish the order

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
for some reason,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
we must assess it at the price of firewood.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
But as a rule, the unfinished production

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
is assessed according to the production cost.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
As well as the finished product,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
if there are no problems with it.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
If there are some problems with it,

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
we suspect that it will not be in demand

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
on the market,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
we must assess it according to the least of the two.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
The production cost or the price of the implementation.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Material assets

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
that consist of equipment,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
transport, office equipment, furniture, etc.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
What is important here

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
to think about in accounting policy?

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Firstly, it is important to think about

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
the value-added limit of recognition.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
That is, starting from what amount

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
a certain position of our assets

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
falls into the list of the main assets.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
But it all depends on the company's turnover.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
The largest figure that I have seen

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
in my practice is 20,000 euros.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
That is, one large production company

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
auditors officially allowed

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
not to include in the list of main assets

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
objects that cost

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
less than 20,000 euros.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
That is, it all goes into the period

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
in which it was bought.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
According to the MFO.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
In the management account,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
we ourselves decide

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
what the value-added limit will be.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I repeat, it all depends on the turnover.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Because in a small hairdresser's

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
20,000 euros is one thing,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
and in a large machine-building holding

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
20,000 euros is quite different.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
So, the auditors may allow

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
a large machine-building holding

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
not to include in the list of main assets

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
positions that cost

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
less than 20,000 euros,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
because for them it is a penny.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
And they can relate it to the period.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
And in the management account,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
even 500 euros is a very large amount.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Therefore, everything above 500 euros

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
in this small hairdresser's

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
can be the main asset.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Further, the next point.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
When we think about the so-called

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
amortization, we must understand

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
what we will amortize.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
The cost of purchase,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
or the so-called recovery cost.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
What is it?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Well, imagine that we are talking

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
about the release of windows

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
and when the window is produced,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
a calibration-grinding machine

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
is used,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
which was bought for 15,000 euros

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
and the estimated operating period

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
is 5 years.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
We can amortize 15,000 euros

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
evenly or not

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
during this five-year period.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
But we ask ourselves,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
how much will such a calibration-grinding machine

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
cost in 5 years,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
when we will change this one

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
to a new version.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
We call the company

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
in which this machine was bought

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
and ask them,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
dear suppliers,

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
how much will such a machine

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
cost in 5 years

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
when we come to you again

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
and buy a new version.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
They will say that about 20,000 euros

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
will cost a new version,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
because the new version of the machine

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
will consume less electricity,

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
will be faster to reconfigure

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
from one product to another,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
will have less manual labor,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and will have a new design,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
a pretty yellow color,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
so the new version will cost

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
about 20,000 euros.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Accordingly, in the management account

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
we can amortize 20,000 euros.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
The estimated cost,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
not the one we paid

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
for this device

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
when we bought it.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
The alternative option

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
is to amortize 15,000 euros,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
and the remaining 5,000 euros

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
is accumulated through the reserves,

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
which we form

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
to modernize the main park.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
The service life, the amortization life.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
As a rule, the amortization life

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
should not be longer than the service life,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
than the operating life.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It can be less, but it should not be more.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
And we, in fact,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
in the accounting policy of the management account,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
decide for ourselves

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
for what period we will amortize

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
the cost of the main means.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Amortization method.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
It can be linear,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
when we spread it evenly,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
it can be non-linear.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
As in the case of a car,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
if we assume that the car

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
loses a lot of cost in the first years of its operation,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
and then loses less,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
then we can use a non-linear method

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
for a car or some other similar main means.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
As for repairs,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
sometimes we have to do repairs

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
of the main means,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
which can be divided into two parts,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
cosmetic and cardinal.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
The cost of cosmetic repairs

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
is usually not added to the cost of the main means,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
but is related to the period consumption.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
The cost of cardinal repairs

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
is still added to the cost of the main means

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
in the balance,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
because these are quite large sums.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
And revaluation of their reserves.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Periodically we should

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
re-evaluate our main means,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
ask ourselves how much we can sell them today,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
ask ourselves

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
how seriously they lost

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
their properties in the process of operation,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
in order to have real figures

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
in our management balance.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Here is a very useful idea about C-analysis,

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
because the list of main means

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
can be very long,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
it can be a thick folder.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
But according to the Pareto principle,

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
80% of all this folder

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
is divided into a 20% list.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
80% of the cost of the main means

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
is 20% of the list.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
It is this limited list

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
that we can re-evaluate for a small amount of money,

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
and we will hardly re-evaluate the rest of the list,

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
because it is not worth it.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
The biggest problem

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
in accounting policy

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
of the management balance

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
is the evaluation of non-material assets.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
The evaluation of non-material assets,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
that is, assets that cannot be touched.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
What can be attributed to this category?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
We can attribute all kinds of patents,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
know-how, licenses,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
software,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
brand,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
client base,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
management systems

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
that we have set up in the company,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
for example, the quality management system,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
the accounting budget management system,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
the CRM system, and so on.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
All this is very difficult to evaluate in euros,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
or in dollars, or in rubles.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But you can try to do it

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
by applying the so-called cost method.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Just add up all the costs

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
that we have incurred

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
to create this non-material asset.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
After that, we will get

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
the preliminary amount of our balance.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Let's look at this scheme.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
We evaluated our material assets,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
our stocks, our main assets,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and so on.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
We evaluated our financial assets,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
money, debit, financial investments,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and so on.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And now we evaluate our non-material assets

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
using the cost method.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
We evaluate all of them.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
We get the preliminary balance.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
After that,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
we need to read

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
the literature on the method

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
of discounted cash flow.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
This is a method

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
that can be used

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
to evaluate the cost of a business.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
The essence of this method

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
is that a business costs

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
as much as it is able to bring

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
to the buyer in the near future.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
If a business is able to generate

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
a lot of money, then it costs a lot.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
If a business does not bring

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
a lot of money in the foreseeable future,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
then it costs little.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Let's say that we predict

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
that in the next four years

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
the size of the cash flow

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
will be like this.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
We know that there is a concept

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
of the cost of money in time,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
so we cannot just add

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
these four quantities.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
We must first discount them.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The formula is very simple.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
The future cost,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
that is, these columns,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
is divided by

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
1 plus r

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
to the power of n.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
We get the current cost.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
n is the number of periods,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
so 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
r is the discount rate.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
As a discount rate,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
the average costs of capital

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
are used in this method.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
How much does the average company

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
pay for the capital

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
it uses?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
For the bank, for its own,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
for the credit,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
it can be calculated.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
The average costs of capital.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
We have discounted our columns

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and we get the sum

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
that we compare

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
with these three blue sections.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
The sum of material, financial

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
and non-material assets.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
The non-material assets,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I emphasize, were evaluated

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
by the cost method.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
If we get this amount

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
using this black method,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
then we must add

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
the so-called

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
discount rate.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
The discount rate

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
is the so-called

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
goodwill.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
This is an English word.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Goodwill means

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
that there is a buyer

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
who is sane, has a clear memory,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
he is fully informed

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
about what is happening

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
in our market,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and he is willing to pay

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
this amount for us.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
In addition to the sum of

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
material, financial and non-material assets

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
that are evaluated by the cost method,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
if we get this amount

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
using this black method,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
that is,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
less than the value

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
of material, financial and non-material assets

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
evaluated by the cost method,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
we close the balance like this.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
This means that part of the money

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
spent on creating non-material assets

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
has gone to waste.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And we close the balance

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
like this.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
This means that we overestimated

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
our non-material assets.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But the common basic principle

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
that we must always remember

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
when writing accounting policy

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
and accounting for applicable assets

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
is the principle of healthy pessimism

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
or the principle of observability,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
according to which we estimate assets

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
at a minimum of possible options.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
At a minimum.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
In the case of debts and obligations,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
the principle of pessimism

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
is also observed,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
but in this case it means

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
that we must evaluate our obligations

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
and debts to the maximum.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
In this case, the principle of pessimism

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
is manifested in this way.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
In particular, this applies to the assessment

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
of reserves that we have

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
in our obligations.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
In general, there are two types

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
of reserves in business.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
There is a reserve, which in English

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
is called provisions,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
and this is, in fact, our obligation to someone.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And there are reserves that are

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
part of our own capital.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Here on this slide we see

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
the difference between them.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Those reserves that we have in our obligations,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
in our debts, are called provisions.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
They can be like this.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
For example, a company

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
creates such an interesting

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
motivation system for staff,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and says, dear employees,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
if you work well in our business

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
for 25 years and after retiring,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
we can pay you a pension

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
together with the state.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
You will receive a pension from the state

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and from our company.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Accordingly, the company

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
creates reserves for pension payments

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
to its employees

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
that they will receive after retiring.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
The question is,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
if an employee retires at 60,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
how much more will he last?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
If the likelihood of his life

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
being up to 120 years is high,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
then the company must

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
create a reserve for each employee

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
for 60 years,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
and a monthly salary, and so on.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
If the likelihood of this is low,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
then we create a reserve for less years.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But it is better to take it with a margin.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
The same is true if we create a reserve

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
for warranty service

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
of clients

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
to whom we sold some household equipment.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
There is a certain likelihood

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
that all the household equipment

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
that we sold to clients in May will break down.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And we will have to repair everything

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
for some period of time.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
But we take a certain period of time

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
that is quite likely for us.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
We take the amount of household equipment

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
that is most likely to break down,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and take this into account

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
to create a reserve.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Again, a little bit with a margin.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
We can include such reserves

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
in our obligations,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
treating them as a duty of our company

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
to our employees or clients.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And there are reserves

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
that are treated as part of our own capital.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
For example,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
we have a reserve for the modernization

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
of the main equipment fleet.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Remember we said that we have a machine,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and we assume that it will not buy a replacement.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Therefore, we amortize the cost of purchase,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
but we accumulate some amount

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
in order to have the opportunity

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
to buy a new version

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
that costs more than the version

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
that we are already using.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Here, in the reserve

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
on our own capital,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
we can include a reserve,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
for example, on a dubious

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
or debitor's debt.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The general formula of the balance

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
in the accounting is very simple.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The capital itself is the assets

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
estimated at a minimum,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
minus the obligations estimated at a maximum.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Including the ProVisions reserves

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that we create as debts

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
to our employees, clients, and so on.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
These are the main rules

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
of the accounting balance

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and accounting policy

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
regarding individual assets,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
obligations, and our own capital.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
The second document that is formed

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
in the accounting policy

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
is the report on profits and losses,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
where we calculate our income

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and expenses for a certain period.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
In addition to this,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
the accounting policy

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
also includes a report on the movement

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
of money funds,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
where we collect information

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
about the income and payments of money.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
It is important to understand

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
that we have to have a document

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
based on the principle of calculations

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
of income and expenses.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
In the other hand,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
we have a report on the movement

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
of money funds,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
where we see everything

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
according to the cash method.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Let's look at this slide

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
to understand the difference.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So, there is a period

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
of January, February, March, April,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
May, June.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
In February,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
the company was unloading

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
its clients

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
with a certain amount of goods

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
or services,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
and in February,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
the revenue is 100,000 UAH.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
As for the movement of money,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
we can see it

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
in the lower part of the slide.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
As a prepayment,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
the company received

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
50,000 UAH from its clients in January.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
In fact,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
the payment of 30,000 UAH in February

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
is 20,000 UAH as a debit.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Accordingly,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
100,000 UAH is received in February,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and in January,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
February, and March,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
50,000 UAH in January,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
30,000 UAH in February,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and 20,000 UAH in March.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The same is the case with the payment of expenses.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Let's assume that

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
in April the company took part

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
in an exhibition.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The participation in the exhibition

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
cost the company

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
a fairly large amount of money,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
some 15,000 UAH.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
The company paid the money

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
to the organizer

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
in April.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
The tranche was paid

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
for 15,000 UAH at the same time.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
This is evident in the report on the movement of money.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
But in the management account,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
we prescribe the account

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
of the so-called expenses of the future periods.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
We want some kind of uniformity,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and therefore we spread

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
this amount for three months.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
We recognize 5,000 UAH as expenses

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
in April, 5,000 UAH as expenses in May,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
and 5,000 UAH as expenses in June.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
If we take all this into account in April,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
the profit in April

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
may be very small, or there may be a loss.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
The profit in May and June may be large.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
We want some kind of uniformity,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
so we can spread

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
a fairly large amount of money

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
spent on the same exhibitions,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
for example, on the same advertising,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
in the management account

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
more or less evenly for 3-6 months.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Accordingly, in the report on the profits and losses,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
in the expenses,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
5,000 UAH will be in April,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
5,000 UAH in May,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and 5,000 UAH in June.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And in the report on the movement of money,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
it will be only in one place,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
in the place where the tranche was carried out.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The money was paid out of the account in April.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
The expenses in the management account

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
that are in the report on the profits and losses

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
are usually divided into four parts.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
On the one hand,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
the expenses can be divided into constant and variable.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
This is very useful.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
On the other hand,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
the expenses can be divided into constant and variable.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Constant expenses are called

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
those expenses that do not depend

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
on the volume of our production.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
It does not depend on the volume of our production.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
If we have a brewery,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
we have to pay for the rent,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
so to speak,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
amortize the capacity,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
pay for the work fee of the accounting.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
It does not depend very much

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
on how many liters of beer

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
we were able to brew and sell.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
These are the so-called constant expenses.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
What are variable expenses?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
These are expenses that depend on

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
how many liters of beer the brewery

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
produced and sold in a particular period.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Accordingly, if there were many liters of beer,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
then the variable expenses are large.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
If there were few liters produced,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
then the variable expenses are smaller.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
On this graph,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
we see that

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
constant expenses do not depend

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
on the volume of liters of beer produced.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Variable expenses depend.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
If we sum up the variable expenses,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
we get the total expenses,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
which at some point

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
intersect with the revenue line.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
When they intersect,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
we register the so-called

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
point of non-profitability.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
At this point,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
the company, having produced

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
a certain number of liters of beer,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
has reached zero.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That is, there is no profit yet,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
but there are no losses.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Starting from this point to the right,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
we start making profit.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
The more profit to the right, the more profit.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It seems to me that many businesses

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
can benefit from

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
constant variable expenses.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Many businesses can ask themselves

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
what benefit

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
we can get

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
by transferring expenses

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
from constant to variable

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
or vice versa.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
For example,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
if I come to Moscow from time to time

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
and do not live here permanently,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
it is probably more profitable

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
to use a hotel.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
If I do it rarely.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
If I come to Moscow all the time,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
it is more profitable

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
to rent an apartment.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I can save money

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
by buying an apartment.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It is also a constant expense.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
The same is true of a car.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
If I rarely move from point A to point B,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
it is easier for me to call a taxi.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
These are variable expenses.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
But if I constantly travel

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
on a certain route,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
it is a constant expense.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Not all expenses in business

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
can be transferred from constant to variable.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
But some can be transferred.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
It is very useful

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
to understand the benefits of outsourcing

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
for your company.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
The second cut of expenses

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
is direct and indirect expenses.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Direct expenses are those

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
that can be attributed

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
to certain types of products.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Indirect expenses are expenses

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
that cannot be attributed.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
There are some types of expenses

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
that can be attributed

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
to a specific product.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
They can be considered variable.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
For example,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
if we talk about a brewery,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
the water, malt, hops

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
are considered direct expenses

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
when making a certain type of beer.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
You can clearly determine

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
the amount of water,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
malt, and malt.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
They can be considered variable

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
because they depend on liters.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
As for constant expenses,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
we have some equipment

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
that is used

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
to make one type of beer,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
but it is not used

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
to make another type.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It will also be direct expenses,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
but they are constant.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Regardless of how many liters of beer

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
we have brewed,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
there are constant expenses.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
At the same time,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
the salary of administrative services

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
will be constant,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
but there will be indirect expenses

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
because it is impossible

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
to assign a certain type of beer

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to a specific type of beer.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
The field of variable and indirect expenses

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
will be usually empty.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I cannot think of

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
any example.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
The report on profits and losses

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
in the administrative accounting

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
is usually made multi-stage.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
For example,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
a business has divided expenses

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
into constant and variable ones

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and the system works like this.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Water gets into the basin

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
with the name of variable expenses.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Water is a revenue.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
At some point,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
the basin becomes full

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and water starts to flow out of it.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
If there is a lot of water,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
it flows into the basin

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
that is below,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
where the constant expenses are written.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
If this basin is filled,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
several drops of water

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
can flow out of it,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
so that we can understand

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
what product in our portfolio

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
brings the amount of coverage

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
to the coverage of constant expenses

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and how much profit

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
is left

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
after we cover

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
our constant expenses.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Here is a small example

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
of this topic.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
The company calculates

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
the amount of coverage

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
for accounting objects,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
and the accounting objects

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
are three types.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
This is a product portfolio.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The company has a product group

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
of Hölzl and an S-class.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
The company sells these two products

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
to two target groups

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
of men and women

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
in North and South Bavaria.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Let's assume

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
that we are talking about bicycles.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
There are Hölzl bicycles

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
and S-class bicycles.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Both men and women

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
living in North and South Bavaria

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
have a product group of Hölzl

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and an S-class.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
First, we calculate the revenue

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
for each product

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
sold to a particular segment

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
in a particular region.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Then we calculate the expenses

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
that can be clearly attributed

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
to a particular product,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
such as Hölzl or S-class.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Then we calculate the expenses

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
that cannot be attributed

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
to a particular product,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
but can be attributed

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
to a particular product.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
For example,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
the advertisement of men's bicycles

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
was made in Men's Health magazine,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and the advertisement of women's bicycles

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
was made in Cosmopolitan magazine.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
This can be clearly attributed

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
to a particular segment of men

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and a particular segment of women.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Then we calculate the expenses

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
that cannot be attributed

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
to a particular product

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
or a particular group of customers,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
but can be attributed

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
to the final profit

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
that the business earned

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
during this period.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
We try to evaluate the direct profitability

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
of product groups,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
customers and regions.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
This is a very useful job

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
and a typical one for a management account.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
After we have prepared

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
the accounting policy

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
of a management account,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
after we have written down

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
all the principles and rules

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
of calculating assets,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
obligations, capital,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
income, expenses,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
income, income,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
and income of the money flow,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
we should think about

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
how to organize it

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
from the point of view

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
of the account system.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
The system itself

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
has a check-in mechanism.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It was invented in 1494.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But there are two

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
fundamentally different possibilities.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
We can introduce all three triangles

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
within the same account system.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
We can take a typical

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
government account plan

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
and modify it, adapt it

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
to the needs of the management account.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
What does it mean to modify?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
To write down sub-accounts

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
in order to make details

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
of the sub-accounts

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
that are not there.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
We can make another

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
sub-account plan for the needs

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
of the management account.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
We have an example in the materials

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
in the conspective.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
The company produces office furniture.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It has chosen the second way

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
for the purpose of the management account.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
It has made a sub-account plan.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
It is made according to a simple scheme.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
As a rule,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
we register all our assets

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
in the account plan.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
We can see that

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
the assets are listed

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
in the account plan

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
on the number 1.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Then we make the details.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
1.1 is the current assets,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
1.1 is the reserves, etc.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Under the number 2,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
the obligations can be taken into account.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
2.1 is the creditor's debt,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
2.1 is the supplier's, etc.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Under the number 3,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
the position of the capital will be taken into account.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
For example,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
3.1 is the established fund,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
3.2 is the reserves.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
3.3 is the unallocated profit.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Under the number 4,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
all the income per period,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
4.1 is the operating income,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
4.1 is the revenue per product,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
etc.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Under the number 5,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
all our expenses.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
5.1 is the materials,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
5.2 is the salary, etc.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
We need to make the details.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
What are the benefits of the second

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
parallel accounting plan?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
In my opinion,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
there is only one

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
valid reason to do this work.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
If our company is consolidated somewhere,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
imagine,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
there is some large international business

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
with an office,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
a central office in Munich.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
As part of this business,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
there are a lot of

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
all kinds of structures and CFOs

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
scattered all over the globe.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Russian structures

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
account for 62% of the total.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Ukrainian structures

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
account for 62% of the total.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Polish colleagues

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
account for 62% of the total.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
In Italy, 62% is not even counted.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Because all countries

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
have their own national problems.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
There is a high probability

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
that the consolidator in Munich

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
will have a brain flow

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
when he will bring it all together.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
He will definitely have a brain flow

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
and will be able to do internal audit.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Therefore, it is easier for him

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
to develop a single system of accounts

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
that is neutral for everyone.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Based on this simple version,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
send it to the entrance

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
to the structural divisions of this company.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Accordingly, in companies that will be

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
managed by accounting,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
accounting will be done within the state accounting plan,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
and the accounting,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
which then goes to the central office in Munich,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
will be carried out in the management plan of accounts.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
If our company

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
does not need to consolidate,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
in my opinion, the accounting

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
can be done within the accounting plan of accounts,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
but it should be finalized

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
for the purpose of accounting.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Detailization of accounts

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and adding accounts

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
that are not there,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
but which are needed in the accounting plan.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
In conclusion, I would like to focus

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
on some organizational aspects

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
of the design of the function

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
of the accounting management

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
and accounting management in the company.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I would like to start

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
with a small company.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
First, imagine

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
that we are talking

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
about accounting management

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
in a family.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
The family is German,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
these are my friends,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
it consists of two people,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Stefan and Martina.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
They live in the suburbs

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
of Munich.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Here they live,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
in the suburbs of Munich.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
They work in different places.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Stefan is a geodeticist by profession,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
he has a small office

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
with a friend

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
in this suburb of Munich.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Martina works as a psychologist

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
in the clinic that is located here.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Neither he nor she is an accountant,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
nor a financial planner,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
nor a controller.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Once again, he is a geodeticist,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
she is a psychologist.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
They have a family car,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
one for two.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
If Stefan used his car

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
for work trips,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
he would go along this route.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
But he goes to work

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
by train,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
arrives at the central station,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
changes trains,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
and so on.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
So Martina needs a car

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
to go to work here.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
You can get here by taxi

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
or by car.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
But

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Stefan is a mountaineer,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
and he spends

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
every weekend in the Alps.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
He usually takes his car

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
for a weekend trip to the Alps

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
to ski in winter,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
to ride a bike in summer,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
and so on.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Stefan and I

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
were in the Alps.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
We came home,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
he puts his car in the basement,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and takes out

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
a magazine.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
A notebook in a box.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
There are three columns

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
– Stefan, Martina,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
and Stefan plus Martina.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
This is the date –

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
27.02.2028, and so on.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I think you guessed

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
that Stefan, having driven

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
for kilometers on the highway

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and then puts the car in this column,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
and Martina, having driven for kilometers

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
on this route or some other route

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
for personal needs,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
puts it in this column.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
If they used the car

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
for family needs,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
or Stefan went to

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
buy a car in a cash-and-carry metro,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
he puts it in this column

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
because it was spent

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
for family needs.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
This gives them

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
an opportunity to assess

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
the economic efficiency

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
of the structural divisions,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
if not in terms of profit,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
then in terms of gross income.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So, the revenue on Stefan minus

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
the direct costs on Stefan

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
is equal to the gross income.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
The revenue on Martina minus

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
the direct costs on Martina

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
is equal to the gross income.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
But there are some general-purpose costs,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
for example, the rent of an apartment,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
which they do not divide by the CFO.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
These are indirect costs,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
but there are no separate services

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
that deal with management accounts.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
That is, each of them

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
has a small controller

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
inside that makes them spend

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
a certain number of minutes

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
in the evening to fix the figures

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
in Excel, to report

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
how much they spent on gasoline, for example.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
In addition, they have a budget,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
they have been dreaming

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
about their own apartment for a long time,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
and their dream,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
their apartment is drawn

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
on a piece of paper

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
with a magnet

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
attached to the refrigerator.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
These are square meters.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Square meters.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
You see,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
as soon as they accumulate

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
another amount

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
enough to buy another square meter,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
they can paint

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
another square.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Let's assume

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
that the prices for real estate

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
do not grow much

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
in Germany,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
but there is a problem,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
because Stefan is fond of Apple products.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
As soon as a new product comes out,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
he may not resist

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
and buy an iPhone.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
After that, he comes home

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
and has to wipe out the painted square.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I am telling all this

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
so that we understand

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
that in small companies

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
there may not be separate services,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
departments, brigades and positions,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
but the function of the management account

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
and management accountability.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
How much we spend, how much we earn.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
But in larger companies

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
such a service usually appears.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I want to tell you about it on this slide.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
So, when we have a larger company,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
in terms of size,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
we have a question

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
who from the structural units

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
to what extent to entrust this function,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
the function of the management account

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
and management accountability.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Very often it is entrusted to the financial director.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
He has a number of other questions

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
in the management instruction.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
To manage the accounting,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
to build relations with the capital market,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
to manage the movement of money.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
But in addition to this,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
the function of the management account

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
is often entrusted to the financial director.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
The second scheme on this slide

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
differs from the first.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
It assumes that the function of the management account

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
is cut out of the subordination of the financial director

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
directly to the director.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
The director is the one

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
who decides

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
whether the financial director

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
is subordinate to the director.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
This is how German companies

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
often do it.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Because they understand

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
the function of the controlling

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
as the function of an internal advisor.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Maybe it will be appropriate

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
to make an analogy

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
with the novel

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
The Godfather.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
If we imagine the organization

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
of this novel,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
there was Don

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
who led a number

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
of structural units.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
But he was a person

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
who could consult

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
with Don

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
as a staff body,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
as a consul,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
as an Italian advisor.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
The function of the consul

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
is different.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
On the one hand,

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
it is intended to ensure

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
that all the canons

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
that should be strictly observed

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
are properly observed.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
In addition, this structure

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
collects all the information

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
and processes it

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and puts it on the management

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
table along with the added value

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and advice.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
That is why some German companies

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
like to make such a structure

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
when the financial director

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
deals with accounting issues,

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
construction issues

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
with the market fund

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
and money management issues.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
The function of the controlling

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
is in a separate unit.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
The same is true

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
for the budget.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
If the sales department

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
is going to Amsterdam,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
what can be the procedure

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
for the approval of this business trip?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
It should come to the controlling department

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
and check

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
whether this business trip was in the budget.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
If it was not there,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
there is a chance that the sales department

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
will not go.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
The remaining funds

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
are enough to go to Amsterdam.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
For example, the sales department

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
can take money from the adjacent

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
advertising articles or from

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
unforeseen expenses

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
that can be up to 5% of the budget.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
It can also turn to the general

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
corporate reserve fund.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Anyway, this issue should be

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
agreed with the controlling department.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
The controlling department monitors

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
the budget and conducts a management

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
account. By giving a waiver,

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
the treasury employees

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
can pay the travel

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
to Amsterdam.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
This is how this procedure can be carried out.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It is very reasonable

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
to make this

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
separate structure

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
for the controlling

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
directly to the subordinate

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
management or shareholder.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
A small example.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
The company operates in the spare parts market.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
It is built

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
according to the divisional principle.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
The managing company has

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
three SBEs,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
the so-called strategic business units,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
which operate in different markets

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
selling spare parts,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
both light and cargo.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
The SBEs are made up of branches.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
How was it decided

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
to designate this function?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
We see that

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
the managing company has a finance department,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
which includes

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
the general accounting,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
the general contract group,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
which deals with contracts

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
with suppliers and clients,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
and the treasury, which manages

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
the movement of money.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
These are all structural branches of the finance department.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
There is a separate department

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
for controlling and risk,

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
which has three functions.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
The managing account,

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
the budget, the company's budget process

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
and risk management.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
The same logic is at the level of the SBE,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
the strategic business units.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
The business unit itself also has

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
a department for controlling and risk.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
They are small,

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
but the logic is the same.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
The small department of finance

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
consists of a small accounting,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
a small contract group

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
and a small treasury.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
There is also a small department

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
of controlling and risk management

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
consisting of a group

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
that leads the managing account

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
and coordinates the budget process.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
If we go down to the branch level,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
there is a finance director

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
who has an accounting,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
a contract, a treasury,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
a managing account, a budget

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
and a risk management.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
This is at the level of the branch.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
At the level of the SBE,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
this is divided,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
and at the level of the holding,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
this is also divided.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
This is the decision

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
on the organizational design

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
that was made in this business.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I am sure, dear listeners,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
that if you do this job,
