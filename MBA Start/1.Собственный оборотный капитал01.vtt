00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today we will talk about our own turnover capital.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First of all, you remember that capital can be both private and borrowed.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In this case, we will talk only about our own capital, not about the capital that is attracted to the enterprise.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Secondly, all capital can be represented as the main and the turnover.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
As you remember, the main capital is the hard-to-realize assets,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
such as land, buildings, infrastructure, equipment, non-material assets and other basic resources.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We have already talked about this part of capital in the previous topics.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Today we will talk about the turnover part of capital.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The turnover part of capital is the hard-to-realize assets, such as reserves,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
debit debt, short-term financial investments and money.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You remember that all these parts of capital are represented in the left part of the balance sheet,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
where we have the assets.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The turnover part of capital takes up a large share of the enterprise.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Each has its own share, but in general, their share is quite large.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is the most mobile part of capital,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the state of this part of capital depends on the results of the enterprise's economic activity

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and the financial state of the enterprise.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It is very important for the enterprise to know whether it has turnover capital,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
what state it is in, and how it works.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The state of the enterprise's own turnover capital depends on the stability of the financial state of the enterprise.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And, first of all, it depends on the optimal distribution of funds at the stage of the process of the turnover.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You know that at the stage of the process of the turnover,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the supply of the enterprise is included, then production, and finally, the production surplus.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And at each stage of the turnover, there is its own turnover capital.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The financial state of the enterprise depends on the optimal distribution of their shares at the stages of the turnover.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If the state of the enterprise is not optimal, it starts to go crazy.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
At the optimal distribution, the enterprise feels great.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
At the first stage, where the supply is, there are reserves.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is a very important part of the asset.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
At the stage of production surplus, there is a debt and cash.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is how the enterprise's own turnover capital is distributed at the stages of the turnover.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The financial state of the enterprise depends on the distribution of the funds at the stages of the turnover.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It is impossible to find the optimal state of the enterprise and say that all enterprises should adhere to it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The size of the investment in each sector of the turnover depends on the sectoral characteristics of the enterprises.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
There are enterprises that require very large material reserves,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
where material production is concentrated to a very high degree.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There are enterprises with a long production cycle, where the largest part of the production is unfinished.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Thus, depending on the sectoral characteristics of the enterprise, the distribution of the funds will be one way or another.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you want to know whether the distribution of the funds of your enterprise is optimal,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
you need to look at the optimal distribution of the funds for the sector that belongs to your enterprise.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then compare your enterprise with this optimal distribution.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The turnover assets can be distributed depending on their liquidity level.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
You should remember that the balance of the assets is based on the liquidity level,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that is, on the speed of their transformation into monetary form.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The higher the liquidity level, the faster it becomes monetary form,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
the lower the line is in the balance of the enterprise.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
The turnover assets are divided by liquidity level into slow-to-achieve, fast-to-achieve

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and the fastest-to-achieve or the most liquid assets.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The slow-to-achieve assets include the reserves of the finished production, raw materials and unfinished production.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Whole warehouses are filled with the reserves that are needed for production.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Today we will talk about this separately, specifically about why the reserves are needed for the enterprise.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We are only saying that the reserves are related to the slow-to-achieve assets.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Moreover, some reserves can be so slow-to-achieve that they become non-liquid.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The fast-to-achieve turnover assets include the debt and the funds on deposits.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The debt, as you remember from our previous lectures,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is the funds that other enterprises owe us.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
First, there are contractual relations, according to which the return of the debt is determined.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Second, each enterprise is actively working on the return of the debt.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Therefore, the debt is returned to the enterprise more or less quickly.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
The funds on deposits are dependent on the enterprise.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The enterprise deposits the free funds on the deposit accounts in the banks.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It can deposit them or not, depending on the purpose and the need it has.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
If it has money, it cannot deposit it now,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
or it needs to be saved for the near future, it deposits it on the deposits.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But you should remember that the deposits are temporary.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
They cannot be taken back at any time.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You agree with the banks, you specify the time for which you cannot use these funds.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
If you need the funds at any time, you should not deposit them,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
but leave them on your account, and then use them at any time.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The most liquid turnover assets are the funds and short-term market securities.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The funds already exist, so to say that they need to be converted into money is a certain condition.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They already exist on your account.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
In some cases, it can be a foreign currency, which can be converted into any other currency,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
including the Russian currency.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It will take some time, though.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Short-term market securities are also an interesting document.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
You can quickly convert these securities into money if the term of their termination is approaching,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
or if you have a need to get rid of them and convert them into money.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You use them to get a certain percentage of these securities.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Assets can also be divided into stable and unstable.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Stable assets are the main assets and some of the turnover assets that are at an unchanged level during the year.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
As you remember, the year is a period during which the accounting period is held.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Some forms of assets change their form during this period, and some remain unchanged.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Some remain unchanged, and the rest of the assets are called unstable assets.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
They change their form.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
In addition to assets, you should remember that passives are also represented in the balance sheet.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Passives are the sources through which the enterprise funds are formed.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Depending on the source of the formation, passives are divided into their own and borrowed ones.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Remember that the own ones are those that belong to the enterprise,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and the borrowed ones are those that the enterprise borrows from the market.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Banks, other enterprises, commercial partners, in any case, these are not its funds.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000
They are taken for a certain period, and after a certain period they should be returned to those who own them.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Passives include their own funds and long-term loans and loans.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
These are permanent passives.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
A short-term passive includes short-term loans and loans,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and some of the long-term loans and loans that will be issued during this period,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that is, during the year.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It is very important for an enterprise to manage assets and passives correctly.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
What does it mean to manage them correctly?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
As we know from previous lectures,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000
assets and passives are characterized by certain periods of their use.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Assets should be replenished in order to function properly.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Passives are the sources that replenish and form assets.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The most important thing here is that the time should match.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That is, the period of time when one form moves to another should match.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
This period of time, tracking of this period,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and the coordination of assets and passives will represent the operational management of assets and passives.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
If we imagine a complex management system,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
it includes the transformation of the current financial needs into a negative amount

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in order to ensure that the enterprise can function steadily due to the funds it has,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
the acceleration of the turnover of funds in the enterprise,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and the choice of the appropriate type of policy of operational management of the current assets and passives.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Next, we will look at all these stages of complex operational management.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
We will consider how the enterprise uses them,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
which of them is more important, which is less important,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and what should be the main emphasis in your business.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So, the first stage is the transformation of the current financial needs into a negative amount.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
First, we should say what the current needs are and how they are covered.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
The enterprise constantly needs to purchase stocks,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
to implement the production process,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and every day it needs to cover certain financial expenses.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Where to get the money to cover these current needs?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000
In fact, the enterprise uses various sources of money,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but among all these sources, it is possible to highlight a certain sequence of means of using to cover the current needs.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
First of all, the enterprise uses its own money.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Why? Because they are free, they are already its own.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000
No one needs to borrow them, you don't have to pay anything for them,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
you don't have to worry about their return,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
you just need to use your own money effectively.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
In any case, business does not allow to relax,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but nevertheless, it is the least evil.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I would even say that it is not evil, but a kind of good news in terms of using money.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So, in the first place, the enterprise always uses its own money.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And what to do if you don't have enough of your own money?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It may be that there is nothing wrong with it,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it is bad only if you are overly involved in borrowing money,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but the small use of borrowed money, moderate use of borrowed money,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is, on the contrary, a sign of effective management of the enterprise's finances.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
In the second place, if you don't have enough of your own money,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
you can get a creditors' debt.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
A creditors' debt is what you owe to your partners.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
They provided you with the means to pay off your debt.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
For example, they provided you with raw materials from which you will continue to produce products.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But you were provided with raw materials with a payment deadline.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You didn't have to pay for it right away, you didn't have to make a prepayment,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
you didn't have to pay in fact, you were given a payment deadline.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
During the deadline period, you got a creditors' debt.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You got reserves that you can use and that you don't spend your own money on.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This is the simplest, easiest form of using borrowed money.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Of course, it's not free, although you may not have to pay interest on the contract.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You should remember that free raw materials can only be found in a mousetrap.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:20.000
In any case, the price of raw materials is already set for the interest for using the means you get.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But what if even a creditors' debt is not enough?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000
What if there are cash outages that need to be covered, but there is not enough money for them?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
What should you do? Then the enterprise uses short-term lending.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The enterprise starts to contact the bank in order to get the borrowed money for a short period of time and then use it.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000
As you remember, the short-term lending in the modern banking system of Russia is not more than one year.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Perhaps, the short-term lending is less, like overdraft loans, which can be up to a month.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
In any case, it's short-term lending.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Perhaps, short-term loans.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000
As you remember, the loan differs from a credit because you borrow money not from the bank, but from another business partner.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
He lends you his short-term funds.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
It's a loan.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And if you lend them to the bank, it's a credit.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
We talked about it in the previous lectures.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
You remember it well, I just reminded you a little bit about it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So, if we need short-term lending, we can use one or another source of their income.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Different sources have different colors in terms of the favorability of their use.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Some use it more favorably, others use it less favorably.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It's an emotional color, but you should know it, because the relationship between a businessman and the world is not only a contractual relationship, but also a relationship painted with human emotions.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:37.000
The most favorable sources of short-term lending, as we said, are commercial loans from suppliers.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Everyone in the business is doing it today, those who trade, who supply raw materials.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
It's a norm of business.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So, using commercial loans, increasing the credit debt, is a normal phenomenon.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
It doesn't cause any tensions that can exist between businessmen.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000
The second source is receiving money from their employees.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I want to draw your attention to the specificity of this form of money, which is used in our country.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
This form is called a salary delay for employees.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:41.000
A businessman doesn't pay his salary on time, and the money is used for business, for the period of salary delay.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
It's the employees of the enterprise that are currently lending to the businessman.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The peculiarity of this form is that it's absolutely free, because I haven't met a single businessman who would pay his salary with interest for a non-temporary payment.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:26.000
So, it's a free form of credit, unlike commercial loans, where it's invested in the price, or bank loans, where it's expressed in the interest rate.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000
But on the other hand, the salary debt can't be increased to infinity.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:49.000
The thing is that the employees went to work for the sake of receiving the salary, and they are ready to suffer for some time from not receiving the salary,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
in order to make the enterprise better, to make it work better, and to improve their relations.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
But they are not ready to never receive the salary.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So, there are certain limits.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Even if a businessman managed to not pay his salary for some time, the situation at the enterprise worsens.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
The staff is shrinking, because not everyone is ready to work without money.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
The staff is shrinking.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The employees are losing their jobs, the less qualified ones are coming, the employees are more nervous,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
people are more interested in the payment of the salary, than in the return of the active participation in the production process.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Anyway, this source is limited in time, because there is a period when people agree not to receive the salary,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000
and after that period, the businessman risks being left alone at the enterprise, which, of course, is not part of his plans.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
So, sooner or later, he stops using this source.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So, this source, even though it exists, and, unfortunately, it is used, is quite limited.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
So, this is the life-saving circle, which can be used for a very short period of time,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
if you know that your situation at the enterprise will improve, and you will restore your situation,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
because this is what the employees hope for, when they agree to suffer for some time without the payment of the salary.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
There is another source.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Another source is the debt payment.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
The state's taxes were not paid in time.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
There is a stick in two ends.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
On the one hand, yes, you received the money, which you can use,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000
but on the other hand, the state is a machine that does not tolerate the lack of repayment of debts.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:22.000
The state, in any case, demands the payment of taxes, and, moreover, will impose fines on their payment.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Therefore, if the profitability of the business is not higher than the fines that the state has to pay for the short-term payment of taxes,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
then it is best not to use this source.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And only if the business is extremely profitable and the profitability of the business is very high,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
then the enterprise is entitled to pay taxes.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
At the same time, it understands that it will still have to pay more fines,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
but to some extent it has to do it, because it has no other means.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000
This is what we referred to as a favorable source of short-term money.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
But there is also a negative one.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
The money could be used to increase the stock excessively.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Everything that is excessive is not good.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.000
There should be an optimal amount of stocks at the enterprise, optimal for optimal work.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
An excessive stock is not used.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:46.000
The excess of stocks is not used, it is a dead weight, and the capital is frozen.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
The frozen capital is not used, and most importantly, it is needed for other purposes.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
You could use it as a borrowed capital if you need to pay for it, you need to return it.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Therefore, excessive stock is harmful for the enterprise.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And the enterprise should strictly ensure that it does not have excess stocks.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
We will talk about this today, when we talk about stocks and determine the optimal amount of stocks.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000
But at this moment you should understand that the enterprise should have an optimal amount of stocks.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
There is a lot of capital freezing, and there is a lack of stocks.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
There is a rhythmical violation.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Imagine an auto-vacuum that produces a car, and there is everything, but no steering wheel.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
This car cannot be sold, this car cannot be further promoted in the production chain.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
There is not a single small component.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
The car is considered to be unassembled.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Therefore, in order not to violate the production chain, there should be stocks.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
But again, the optimal amount.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:19.000
The next negative point that can be associated with the use of turnover capital is the provision of excessive payments to clients.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000
The fact is that both our enterprise receives goods loans from the suppliers of raw materials,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000
and we participate in this trade chain, we ourselves provide goods loans to those who buy our goods.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Today, the business is arranged in such a way that a lion's share of the goods that move in the trade chain is provided with a payment in the form of a goods loan.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
We are provided with raw materials, and we provide our products to those who buy from us.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:08.000
The most important thing here is not what the goods loan is providing, but not to violate its optimal amount.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Do not make the provision excessive.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Because if you start to provide excessive payment in the amount or for a very long time, you will lose your turnover capital.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
You will have problems that you do not need.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Therefore, each enterprise independently decides for itself what kind of payment delay to make to its partners.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Without a payment delay, there is a risk of losing a partner in general.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
This is also very bad.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
If you can not implement your product, it does not matter that you do not release it.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
It does not matter that the enterprise has stopped.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Therefore, the payment delay should be given, because if you do not provide it, your competitors will provide it.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Payment delay is not such a gesture of charity.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
This is the current situation of the market.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
You need to be the same on the market as your competitors.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000
If your competitors provide goods loans in a competitive struggle, you have to provide it.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Therefore, we assume that any enterprise will and must provide goods loans.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
But it should not provide it without restrictions.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
To the right and to the left, in an unlimited amount, for an unlimited time.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It will simply lose its money.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Everything should be in moderation.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
If we sum up all the needs of the enterprise, which arises in it at the current time,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
we will get the current financial needs.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:15.000
From what we have just discussed, it is clear that the current financial needs are equal to the sum of reserves

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
plus the debt.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:28.000
That is, you need reserves for production and you need a debt to provide goods loans to your partners.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
These are your needs.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
These are two quantities.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And what reduces your current financial needs?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:45.000
The debt is the amount of credit that you have provided to your trading partners.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Therefore, this amount should be reduced.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
This is the saving circle that your partners provide to you.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000
There are two very important assumptions in this formula.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
On the one hand, we see the need that is determined by your business.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
On the other hand, the help that the market provides to you, based on the market situation.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Hence, the interests of the enterprise.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
For example, the enterprise is interested in reducing its reserves.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
We have already discussed that the enterprise is absolutely not profitable to reduce its reserves.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It is profitable to reduce them, but not below the optimal value.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Because reducing them below the optimal value causes failures in the enterprise's operation.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And failures are losses.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
That is, the benefit from reduction is leveled off by the loss from failures.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Therefore, the enterprise tries never to reduce the value of its reserves below the optimal value.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
The enterprise is interested in reducing its debt.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Of course.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000
There is no special meaning in giving your own funds to your trading partners.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Business is not charity.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
