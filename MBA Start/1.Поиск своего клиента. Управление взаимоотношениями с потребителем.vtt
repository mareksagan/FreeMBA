00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello, dear colleagues. My name is Svetlana Sterhova.

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
I have a degree in marketing in the MBA program of the Russian Academy of Foreign Trade.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
My professional experience is 17 years. I have worked in both the industry and the FMCG market.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
More than 50 consulting projects have allowed me to gain a lot of experience

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
both when forming a home network and when bringing new goods to the market.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Among my clients are companies like Motorola, Johnson & Johnson,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Accent Switzerland, Volga Telecom.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Today, the orientation towards clients is not just a fashion trend.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Today, clients put the price factor only on the 6th or 7th place.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
What does it mean in practice?

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
In practice, it means that companies simply miss their potential profit

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
or they do not get it because they are mainly oriented to the price factor.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
It is because we pay attention only to our clients, which are already in our company,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
we do not see our potential.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
And this has nothing in common with the management of our client base.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
This applies only to the actual work with our existing clients.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
In this regard, the topic of finding your client is very relevant today

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
for the development of the company, for the continuation of the market share,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
even in the conditions of very tough competition.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Today, we will discuss a few topics that are dedicated to finding your client on the market.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
The first is, of course, the topic of segmentation.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
We will consider the main criteria for segmentation

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
and several methods that will allow you, depending on the specifics of your market,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
to segment your clients and highlight the most important ones.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
The next topic we will consider is the choice of the customer behavior model and its assessment.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
How to see the process of choosing your product or service for your clients?

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
We will consider this on a practical example and see how it affects the results of your work.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
And the next main point is, of course, the client-orientedness of the company.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
We will consider the tests for client-orientedness,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
see the main factors and the main points to pay attention to

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
when forming a key client base, when working with them,

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
and focus on the results you will get

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
if you think about how to work with your key clients.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Let's start with the market trends.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
What do we see on the market today? What is happening today?

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
The first thing that is very noticeable is that foreign companies

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
are increasingly entering our Russian market.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
Russia, together with other countries, such as China, India, Brazil,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
are the fastest-growing countries today.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
That is why we are being paid attention to by the world public.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
What does this give us?

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Of course, as consumers, we see a wider range of products and services.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
But if we look at it from a business point of view,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
we need to pay attention to the fact that if we do not focus on our client,

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
if we cannot serve him well and provide what he really wants,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
we simply will not be able to compete in the market,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
because the product itself becomes more and more standard, and even the service.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
That is why we need to think about how to surpass our foreign competitors.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
The next trend that is very visible is the export of products to developing countries.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Even in Russia, the labor force has become quite expensive,

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
and many manufacturing companies produce their own products in China,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
because it is simply cheaper.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
China is a global power that helps the world to produce products with lower cost

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
and, accordingly, to get a higher profit.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
The next point is our industry, which has not yet risen from its knees

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
after the conversion that took place in the 1990s.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
More than 70% of equipment has become outdated,

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
and, unfortunately, the state does not have the opportunity to completely renew the entire park.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
What do we get from this?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Of course, an industrial crisis.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Although some industries, such as, for example, the steel industry,

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
are starting to rise by themselves,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
that is, they invest in their own business,

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
other companies, especially large industrial enterprises, simply do not have the funds for this.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
And, unfortunately, they cannot renew their equipment park,

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
and, of course, they do not have the opportunity to produce competitive products

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
with their own equipment, taking into account their own technical park.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Another serious trend is the limit of ownership in the especially developing markets.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Unfortunately, we depend on the influence of the state,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
on the influence of politics and business,

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
while working with politics in such a serious relationship.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
We depend on the legislation, on what is adopted at the highest level.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
And, of course, for the state and for politics,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
the most important interest is presented by those industries that are developing the most actively.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
These are telecommunications, real estate, raw materials markets, and so on.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Naturally, so far, it is not very stable there,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
although the profits are very high in these markets, and, in fact, the income is also high.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Another trend that is particularly pleasing is, of course, the active development of the medium business.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
If we take the statistics of Western countries,

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
we will see that the medium business is the main, basic part, the basic stratum of society,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
and only due to this country it is very actively developing.

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
Until today, the medium business has been very affected by various factors of the external environment.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
These are the economy, politics, legislation.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Today, the government has decided to support the medium business,

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
and the medium business is slowly beginning to develop, to develop more and more actively.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
And, in fact, we are striving for the same development that we see now in the West.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
This is a very good trend that will allow our country to develop not only due to raw materials resources.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, since our market is actively developing, what are we doing?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Of course, we are expanding our sales channels, of course, we are looking for new clients.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
But at the same time we make a lot of mistakes.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
What are the main mistakes we make when we form our sales network, when we think about where and how to sell?

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, the very first mistake that I would like to say is, of course,

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
ignoring where and why our clients buy our product or our service.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
We think we know everything, we are experts in our market, because we have been working on it for a long time.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
We sell our product, we present it, but in fact, we need to think more and more about where else we can buy our product,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
where else we can present it, what other sales channels can be used.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Maybe there are not so many competitors yet.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
The next serious mistake that we, as managers, always make, often make,

07:23.000 --> 07:31.000
we think that all our sales channels, all our intermediaries, all our clients will be happy to accept our new product,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
they will be happy to change for the sake of our offer.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But nothing like this happens in life.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
It is always more difficult to sell new products, new products, new services.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
You need to look for clients, you need to attract them, you need to convince them that our product is really worth their attention.

07:46.000 --> 07:54.000
To this day, it has not yet come to us very well,

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
and we always stumble upon this, offering our product, our product ambitiously and in the form of resistance of our clients.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Of course, these moments must be taken into account.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Another important point, one important mistake.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
We are always in a hurry, we have a very high rhythm of life, and we need everything quickly, today, or better yesterday.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
And, in fact, for this reason, we do not carefully approach the choice of our intermediaries.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And this is due to very large losses.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
After all, the cost of spending on an intermediary, on the search for a client, on his attraction, on his retention is very high.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
And according to statistics, the client works out only a year later.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
That is, all the expenses that we have incurred, we pay off only a year later.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Imagine if your client did not work out a year, but left after the first purchase, or after the second.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Consider that you have lost.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
You have made some income, but you have lost in profit.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
Therefore, it is better to approach the choice of your intermediaries very carefully at the beginning, at the first step.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
This way, the image of your product will not be lost, and you will know exactly who you work with and under what conditions.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
The next mistake is the lack of calculations.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, here, probably, the situation on the market is such.

09:15.000 --> 09:27.000
Not all companies introduce a system of accounting, management accounting, which allows you to allocate expenses for each of the intermediaries.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
And all this is considered the so-called boiler method.

09:30.000 --> 09:39.000
Thus, we do not see which intermediary is beneficial for us, and which one takes away more resources from us than profits.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
The next important point is that we do not make a budget as a client.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
This is also mostly related to the financial service.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
But the initiator, of course, should be either the sales director, or the commercial director, or the marketing director.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Because it is very important to calculate and control the costs that we incur on each channel.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
That is, not just by fact, calculate and see.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
We did not get profits, we got losses.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
And to control this in the process, so as not to get big losses at the end of the year.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
The next mistake, which we make just as often.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
We do not want to give up the already existing channels of sales.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
We say, we work with clients, we are doing well with them.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Well, what do they take, not so often.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
Well, what do they add to our logistical expenses, or require an additional discount.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Nevertheless, we are afraid to lose those clients who are there.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And they are not always profitable.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
If this client does not bring you profits, then have the courage to say no.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And find another client who will really be beneficial to you in your work.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
The next point is when we develop only one channel of sales.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
We focused on it and go with you.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
On the one hand, this is great, such a strategy of specialization.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
But on the other hand, we have very high risks.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
What if this channel does not work?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
What if it does not bring us the income that we expect?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Or will not give us such a profit?

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
For insurance, you always need to have a spare channel of sales.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Or develop two or three at once, at least.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
In order to be more stable in the market.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Another important point is the conflicts in the channels of sales.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
We should never avoid them.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Because sometimes our goals do not coincide, sometimes our interests do not coincide.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
And this is normal.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But these problems still need to be solved.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
By keeping them in silence, we push away from ourselves the important clients we need.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
When you go to solve these problems,

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
naturally, the clients remain grateful to you and understand that you are a partner.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
You are not just a supplier, but a partner.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And you are ready to solve the issues arising.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Two more points that need to be taken into account when forming a channel of sales.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
The first is the support of personal relations with clients.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Relations with important people.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Relations with those who make decisions or influence the decision-making.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Because sometimes there are such gray cardinals in the company.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
On which we do not go out and think why we need this.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
We have a contact person, we work with him.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
But we do not get the turn that we want.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
Just establishing relations, very high-quality communication will allow you to solve this problem.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
The second point I would like to say is very important.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
It is the final in the list of mistakes, but not the last.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
We just do not have a database of our clients.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
Some companies already have CRM systems that allow you to control the work with key clients.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
To have a full database, assess the situation, constantly control it.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
But even in companies where these CRM systems are not installed,

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
the probability that the database of clients is very low.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
Although it can be run without a CRM system, it can be run in ordinary programs.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
The main thing is that everything is in electronic form.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
The main thing is that it is constantly updated.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
So that the database is alive, so that it is working.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
So that additional data is brought in.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
That's when the company gains stability.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
Because leaving work, the manager takes with him all the knowledge about your client, all the contacts.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
And the sales managers, as we know, tend to change.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
Thus, the company undermines its stability if it does not control the situation.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Well, colleagues, let's move on to our topics.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Let's talk about the first topic, segmentation.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
In general, market segmentation is a very serious trend.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
I want to say that in the West, this method has been used for about 100 years.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
And today there is even another trend.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
The next is personalization.

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
That is, they do not just select market segments, but select key clients and individually start communicating with them.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
We have not yet reached such a level of development.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
That is, our market says that we need to select segments,

14:11.000 --> 14:23.000
we need to determine target criteria for us and work only with those groups of clients that will allow us to realize the goals set.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
We will consider the criteria for segmentation of the consumer market and the industrial market.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
We will look at the difference and the methods that can be used to select your target segments.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Let's start with the consumer market.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
The criteria for segmentation are probably known to you.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
They are used very often.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
There are at least three groups.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
In fact, there can be more groups, but often three groups are used.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
The first group is regional criteria.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Why are they important?

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
Because we care about the location of the region, its specifics, the number and density of the population.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Because it's great to offer your products when there are more clients.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
Then the cost will be much lower per unit of the product,

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
than if we will deliver our product per unit to each client in different regions.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Therefore, the larger the population density, the more profitable it is for the company.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
The transport network of the region is very important, because we need to be able to deliver the product.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
If we talk about the availability of roads, the availability of the possibility of car transport,

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
we see that these problems have not yet been solved in our country.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
Therefore, we have to use sea routes, air routes, railways.

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
Therefore, in order to reduce logistical costs, we need to understand how we will deliver the product.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
Or maybe if the market capacity is very large, we should open a regional warehouse,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
and then the costs will be reduced.

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
The segmentation criteria of the consumer market help you understand where it is more profitable for you to sell your product.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
The next group of criteria is demographic criteria.

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
They are used very often and are used on almost all consumer goods.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
The first is gender and age.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
It is clear that there are men's and women's goods.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
In general, the topic of women's and men's products is very interesting and is in fashion,

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
because it is one of the criteria when you can draw attention to one product.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
This is one of the good ideas for promotion today, which works great.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Age is important.

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
One thing is when we sell to small children, another thing is when we work with pensioners or with the middle age.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
Naturally, there are different needs, different interests, different requirements for the product.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Therefore, age also plays a very important role.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
The next point that can be taken into account is the level of education.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
It does not work for all goods.

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
For example, if we take books or software, this is a very important criterion to find your buyer.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Another point that can be taken into account is the profession of consumers.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
The profession of consumers also sometimes plays a role.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
It can also be a software, or maybe even a clothing market, or a food product market.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
Because people working in the North can prefer certain things, certain products.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
People working in the South can be completely different.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
Therefore, it is very important to understand which criteria to choose and to segment your product according to them.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
I want to say that not all criteria must be chosen.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
That is, from the list that you have, you can only choose those that are really suitable for your product.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
There is another group of criteria.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
This is the lifestyle of consumers.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
What do they mean?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Of course, these are social groups.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
Schoolchildren, students, pensioners, workers, servants, and so on.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
Here you can give an example of companies that deal with telecommunications.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
For example, in Empel.com or MTS, they have very clearly defined tariffs,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
which are intended for certain social groups.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Student tariff, for schoolchildren, and so on.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
That is, they play this very well, just like that, by segmenting their consumers according to this criteria.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
A few more criteria.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
This is, for example, the frequency of use of the product, the degree of its use.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
If you use the product often, then you are a more interesting buyer for the manufacturer or for the supplier.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
Why? Because it will fail faster, break down faster, you will use it faster, and you will come for the next product a second time.

18:53.000 --> 19:03.000
Therefore, of course, some manufacturers of products pay attention to those buyers who use their products most often.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
This is also one of the criteria for segmentation.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, there are two more criteria that can also be taken into account.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
This is the experience of use.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
That is, if you have already used this trademark, this product, you already have some opinion.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And for the manufacturer it is great if this opinion is positive.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
Thus, he practically acquires an adherent when you come for the same brand a second time, and you are interested in it, and you know it.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
There will be no more surprises and discoveries for you.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
You know exactly what you will take, what quality of product you will get.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
Well, the category of adherents itself is those people who say,

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
I prefer only such a brand, for example, office equipment, or only such a brand of household appliances.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
This is the gold mine of our manufacturers.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
Because they do not need any preferences, any benefits, any discounts.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
They will come and buy.

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
They follow the new products, they look at what is being produced, and, in fact, come for your products again and again,

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
knowing that you will not present any bad surprises.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Well, these were the segmentation criteria of the consumer market.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
And what is the difference between the segmentation criteria of the industrial market, the B2B market?

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
I remind you that companies that work in the wholesale market belong to the industrial market.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
That is, B2B is a business for business.

20:24.000 --> 20:33.000
When we work with you for resale or for the use of our product or our raw material or our product in some of our products.

20:33.000 --> 20:41.000
That is, it is not necessarily machines, equipment, it can be food products, it can be fabrics, it can be anything.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
But if you work in the wholesale market, then you work in the industrial market.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Well, now about the criteria.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
And the first criterion is a bit similar to the criteria of the consumer market.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
These are the quantitative parameters of the segment.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Naturally, the more clients we have in this segment, the more profitable it is for us.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
The next criterion that is important to consider is the availability of the segment.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
What does this mean?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
This means at least two things.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
The first is physical availability so that you can get this product.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
And the second point is availability from the point of view of entering this market.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Well, imagine if you participate in a tender for budget financing.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Obviously, the availability of this segment is not so easy, not so good to get there.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
You need to get acquainted with the right people, you need to discuss the conditions under which you participate in the tender.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Maybe you will make some concessions.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
Therefore, it will not be so easy to conclude this contract.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
And in this case, the availability of the segment will have a very low point for you.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
And you need to understand whether it is profitable for you or not, whether you need it or not.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
And depending on the goals, there will be a result.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Are you going into this segment or not?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
The next criterion is very important, this is the sustainability of the segment.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
This is similar to seasonality.

21:53.000 --> 22:00.000
Sustainability is when, for example, the product is produced for half a year, and for half a year nothing is produced at all.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
There are many examples.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
For example, the shoe cosmetics market.

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
It is not sustainable at all, because it is sold only in the fall and early winter.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
And spring and summer are a dead season for this product, oddly enough.

22:21.000 --> 22:31.000
Therefore, a company that produces such a product needs to look for some other product so that the production cycle is constant.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
To work not only in winter and autumn, but also in spring and summer.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
From this point of view, you evaluate how sustainable your segment is.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
Will you be able to sell your product to these buyers constantly, throughout the year?

22:44.000 --> 22:55.000
If you have a light seasonality, then the change in the volume of sales is slightly less or slightly more, depending on the time of year and month.

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
This is simply taken into account when planning sales and does not have a special impact on your business.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Profitability of the segment.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Of course, we look at how much we can earn.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
And here again, we can bring in budget companies, or, let's say, financing from the budget and commercial companies.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
For example, the medical equipment market.

23:15.000 --> 23:27.000
If we look at the budget hospitals or hospitals, and commercial hospitals, who do you think is more profitable to sell the product?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
In fact, the situation is very interesting.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
If we go back 10 years ago, everything was obvious and clear there.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
There was no money in the budget, and it was profitable to sell, of course, to commercial companies.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Today, everything has changed.

23:42.000 --> 23:55.000
Money has appeared in the budget, and even if there are not so many of them, budget companies often do not look so seriously at the price of the product.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
They look at the service complex, and so on, at some additional services.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
But commercial companies, on the contrary, trade very well at a price.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
Therefore, today, in terms of profitability, the budget market is much more profitable than the commercial market.

24:12.000 --> 24:21.000
Therefore, look at what is in your goals, what you want to achieve, and depending on this, of course, choose a segment of work.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
The level of competition.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Well, of course, each segment has its own number of competitors.

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
And here you just need to evaluate which segment has more of them, which segment has less, where are the large clients, where are many small clients.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
And in the same way, set a point of attractiveness and choose a segment at the level of competition.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
At the same time, it is necessary to understand that the higher the competition, the more costs you will incur in the fight against competitors.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
This, of course, is not in favor of the company.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
Well, the next criterion is the level of protection from competition, your protection.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
What does this imply?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
This is the presence of at least one competitive advantage.

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
That is, if you are at least somewhat different from your competitors, maybe you have an increased warranty, maybe you have a delivery service to your home,

25:05.000 --> 25:15.000
maybe you offer something else to your clients, if you are at least somewhat different, you are successful, you already have protection from competition.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
If you have a standard product or service, then you need to think about what to do, because you are unlikely to be able to perform well in this market.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
You will not be able to position yourself, your product or service, qualitatively and competently.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
And people will not understand why you need to choose your product, not the product of your competitor.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And the sales will be random.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
The next criterion is the advertising capabilities of the company in the segment.

25:37.000 --> 25:45.000
Well, such a criterion is as simple as advertising your product and product, how many different sources,

25:45.000 --> 25:55.000
how many opportunities, and television, and press, and radio, and other media, and the Internet system, where only we do not advertise our product.

25:55.000 --> 26:03.000
But here you need to clearly understand whether we can advertise our product where our clients are.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
From this point of view, of course, you need to consider each segment.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
The next criterion is the dependence of the segment on limiting goods and services.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
What is it?

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
Is it a product without which your product simply will not work?

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
Like a car without gasoline, for example, or a printer without a cartridge.

26:23.000 --> 26:31.000
That is, are there any things that need to be provided for your product to be purchased?

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
If there are no such deliveries in this segment, or the product does not arrive,

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
your task is to ensure the availability of these limiting goods and services so that your product sells better.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
Well, the next criterion is the technological difficulties of working in the segment.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
In fact, this is a very important criterion, and often we just do not pay attention to it.

26:53.000 --> 27:00.000
But it happens that people simply cannot integrate their technology or production into our product.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
For example, they do not have the equipment, or there are simply no specialists.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
And all our products, our technology, our goods simply hang in the air,

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
because they do not have the opportunity to use them.

27:12.000 --> 27:19.000
From this point of view, you need to think very clearly and very carefully how easy it is to use your product.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I will give an example.

27:22.000 --> 27:32.000
Five years ago, hospitals began to equip very serious modern ultrasonic machines and ultrasonic scanners.

27:32.000 --> 27:42.000
So, when these devices were put in hospitals, it was just such a technological difficulty of working in the segment.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
People are just doctors, they did not know how to work on them, they did not know English,

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
they did not know how to communicate with computers, and the skills of working on a computer were very strong.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
And the capabilities of this equipment were just great.

27:56.000 --> 28:07.000
That is, an experienced doctor could detect a lot of different diseases and various things that occur in a person's body.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
But due to the fact that they simply could not use the program, because it was, first, not russified,

28:12.000 --> 28:20.000
and secondly, doctors simply did not have the skills, and hospitals could earn money on this as on additional services.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Here is your missed opportunity.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
Therefore, of course, you need to clearly understand how your products will be used.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
This is important today and very serious.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
Well, dear colleagues, we have considered the criteria of segmentation, and now we turn directly to the techniques.

28:36.000 --> 28:43.000
And we will start in the same way with the method of selecting target segments for the consumer market.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
That is, this is a market where we work immediately for the end consumer.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
You have a multi-factor segmentation model on the slide.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
I will tell you how such segmentation is carried out, what results we can get from this model.

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
The first thing we do is, of course, identify the requirements of our consumers or wishes.

29:07.000 --> 29:16.000
But these are not technical characteristics, but just the characteristics that they pay attention to when choosing your product or a similar product.

29:16.000 --> 29:26.000
A selection is made, and a selection is not very large, it is 15-20 people who are customers or buyers of your product.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
And you actually interview them on the subject of what characteristics are really interesting to them.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
An example is given in the table for bicycle users.

29:37.000 --> 29:45.000
When we all rode a bike, or when we were children, or when we were adults, such a product is known.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
That is why the example is given for bicycle users.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
Look, pay attention to what characteristics our clients chose when the survey was conducted.

29:55.000 --> 30:03.000
The first is, of course, the technical characteristics, because it is important for everyone what size the bike is, the weight, what tires are on the wheels, etc.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
What seat is there.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
This is a standard set of characteristics that we pay attention to when choosing a bike.

30:10.000 --> 30:18.000
The next point that our customers paid attention to is, of course, the price, which is also a factor that cannot be avoided.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Although it is not in the first place, nevertheless, attention is paid to it.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
The next factor is special features.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
This is the presence of various additional functions in the bike.

30:28.000 --> 30:36.000
For example, a speed switch, or some additional braking system, or some special seat.

30:36.000 --> 30:49.000
That is, this is all that can be done additionally to the bike, such a tuning, and make the bike the most comfortable for you to rest or train on it, depending on what is important to you.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
The next point is reliability.

30:52.000 --> 31:02.000
Well, so that it does not break at some point when we leave for 50 kilometers from the city, and then we will have to either carry it on ourselves or load it somewhere.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Therefore, reliability is important.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
However, there is a very interesting dependence.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
The more special features we have, that is, additional functions in the bike, the less reliable it is.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
This is the law of physics.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
But manufacturers try to find a balance to ensure reliability and equip the bike with some additional features.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
The next point is the ease of use.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
To make it simple to understand, you just sit down and go.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
And do not read the technical instructions how to use this item.

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
Because the bike is a product that does not want to be fixed, how does it work.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
And two more criteria that our buyers announced.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
This is the brand's fame and the company's image, let's say.

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
And the design of the bike, that is, its appearance, how important it is.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
In fact, we listed all these characteristics in this method.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
And the next step that we took, we asked our developers.

32:08.000 --> 32:16.000
These are the last two columns, which are on the left in the table, where we consider two models of the bike.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
The models are hypothetical, they have nothing to do with the real models.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
So, a tornado and a firecracker.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
And we asked our manufacturers the following question.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Here is a list of consumer characteristics.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
And now, please explain what you laid out during development.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
What characteristics did you pay special attention to?

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Please mark them with the letter A.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
Mark the characteristics that were just important.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
The second place that was left, mark them with the letter B.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
And C, mark the characteristics that you did not pay attention to during development.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
There is one subtlety here.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Developers always want to put A to all the characteristics.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Because their product is the best.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
And this does not happen in life.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
Therefore, the following requirements are to have letters A, B and C.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
That is, you need to choose the most important things.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Just important and not necessary.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
The next step that we carry out.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
We begin to survey our segments of the main consumers.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
Here are four segments that we can offer our bikes to.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
These are athletes, professionals, schoolchildren.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
These are people who lead an active lifestyle.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
These are rural residents who also use bicycles.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Here is what happens next.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
And then we ask consumers in each segment.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
You do not need to choose a lot of people.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
It can be 5-10 people.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
Who will mark the importance of each of the characteristics that are here.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
They also put letters A, B and C in each characteristic.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
And then we get two profiles.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
We start to compare them with you.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
What do consumers want and what do manufacturers give us?

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
And so we find out what parameters we provide.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
What our consumer wants.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
And what we cannot provide.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
And we choose the target segments.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Let's look at the example of professional athletes.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
What did they say when we asked them a question.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
About what characteristics are most important for them, what are the least important.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
The most important characteristics for professional athletes were the following.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
These are special opportunities and reliability.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Right, because they have intensive training, a very serious regime.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
They need all these additional opportunities.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
And of course it is necessary that the bicycle does not break.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
So that it allows them to train very seriously.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
The second place in importance they put the following characteristics.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
These are technical characteristics and brand fame.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
Since they are also interested in them.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
This is the weight of the bicycle, its size.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
And the trademark or the company that produces these bicycles.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
For professional athletes this is a really important parameter.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
All other parameters turned out to be unnecessary.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
And they put a letter C on these criteria.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
And now we compare with you.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
What kind of bicycle is suitable for us, for professional athletes.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And what characteristics.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
We compare profiles.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
And we look, for example, we take the first characteristic.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
These are technical characteristics.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
And we, professional athletes, say that for us this is just an important characteristic.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
That is, in second place.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
We compare with what the manufacturers gave us.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
And the manufacturers say that in Tornado it was a particularly important characteristic.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
And they laid down very serious opportunities for it.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And marked with the letter A.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
And here by Salyut it's just B.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
Let's see if it matches what our clients want.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It turns out that it matches.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
That is, we satisfy their requirements.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
They said we want B.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
And we have even more in one bike than they ask.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
And in the second one it completely matches.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Therefore, we put two pluses for you.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Under the number 1 and under the number 2.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Under the number 1 is marked Tornado.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Under the number 2 is marked Salyut.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Let's go further on the characteristics.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
The next is the price.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
And at the price, our professional athletes put only C.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
This is not important to them.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
Therefore, we do not compare the profile here, but just skip it.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
Because if it is not important to them, why should we compare?

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
The next feature is special opportunities.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
And now we compare the profiles of our client and our developers.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
According to special opportunities, the requirements are serious.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
That is, this is a very important feature for clients.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It is marked with the letter A.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Let's see what the manufacturers have.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Tornado has the same A.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
And the requirements match.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Therefore, we put a bold plus.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Salyut has the letter C.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
We do not meet the requirements of our clients.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
And we put a minus.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
The next feature is reliability.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
According to reliability, we also have the letter A.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Let's see what the manufacturers have.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
Our manufacturers have B for Tornado, and A for Salyut.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Naturally, A is more than B.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Therefore, we do not meet these requirements for Tornado.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
We do not meet them and put a minus.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
But according to Salyut, all the requirements match.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Therefore, we boldly put a plus.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
The next feature is ease of use.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
For professionals, this is not an important feature at all.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Therefore, we also omit it and move on to the next.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
And the next feature is the image of the company or the brand's fame.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
And we remember and see that for professional athletes this is B.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
This is important.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
And what do the developers offer us?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Let's see.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
The developers offer us A for Tornado.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
They paid special attention to this.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
And this is a well-known brand of a very good bike.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And C for Salyut.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
They did not pay attention to this at all.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
It turns out that we have a plus for Tornado,

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
because we meet the requirements of our customers.

37:59.000 --> 38:05.000
And a minus for Salyut, because we do not meet the characteristics that they wanted and marked.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
The next feature is design.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
According to the design, the assessment was C from the side of the customers.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Therefore, we do not evaluate it in the same way.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
What do we do next?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Let's sum up.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
We add separately pluses and separately minuses.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
And what do we see?

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
We see that Tornado has three pluses and one minus,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
and Salyut has two minuses and two pluses.

38:26.000 --> 38:32.000
Naturally, the more pluses, the more attractive the segment.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
But, of course, the example can be simple.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
We could say that Tornado is more suitable for professionals than Salyut.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
But the whole point is that the method does not end there.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
This is not only the selection of target segments

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
and the determination for which segment which product suits you best.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Yes, we chose Tornado for professional athletes.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
But we see one minus there.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Let's ask ourselves a question.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
Can we fix it to fully meet the requirements of our customers?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
What is our minus?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
And the minus is our reliability.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Can we do something with reliability?

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
In theory, we can give a task to the developers and say,

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
increase reliability so that we fully meet the requirements

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
that the client has asked for.

39:17.000 --> 39:23.000
But, you see, when we increase or improve a quality characteristic,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
it always affects the cost.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Considering that the clients have designated the cost as an optional characteristic,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
it does not matter how much it costs.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
We can increase the price, of course,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
due to the fact that we increase reliability,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
the price will increase,

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
and we will not lose the market.

39:42.000 --> 39:49.000
But the price is still compared with the same characteristics of the products.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
Therefore, we cannot jump very high for the price.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
But sometimes there are moments when we simply cannot raise the price,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
if it is not applicable to the bike, for example.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
Therefore, we must think about what characteristic we can reduce.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
Because the requirements of consumers are lower.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Why should we give more than they want?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
They did not ask us for this.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
So, what do we see here?

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
We see that we have one of the characteristics,

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
more than our customers wanted.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
What is this characteristic?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
The first is the company's image.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Because they said that it is important to them,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
and we paid special attention to it.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Therefore, here we can think

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
whether we can produce such a bike under a different brand

40:38.000 --> 40:44.000
and optimize the cost, increasing reliability.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
And one more point that we can work on.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
This is not only the company's image,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
but also technical characteristics.

40:52.000 --> 40:57.000
We say that we paid a lot of attention to this.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
Maybe we can improve some technical characteristics,

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
and this will not affect the quality of the product,

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
but it will fully meet the requirements of our customers.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
This is the value of the technique.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
It not only allows you to select the target segments,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
but also allows you to understand how to optimize your characteristics

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
to make the most valuable offer to the customer.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
There are moments when you cannot do anything.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
The product is already there, it is ready,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
you are not its manufacturer, you just sell it.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Then the technique will help you to understand

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
what to focus your attention on,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
where are your main advantages,

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
and just not to talk about your disadvantages.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
This is how the whole advertising works.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Therefore, the technique is very valuable,

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
it helps to select the first target segments quickly and well,

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
and secondly, to understand what to focus on in advertising

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
and how to optimize our product to meet the requirements of our customers.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
The next technique I would like to give as an example

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
is the technique of segmentation of industrial markets.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Here I will give an example of the roofing market.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
A consulting project was carried out,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
and this market was assessed very seriously,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
in various regions.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
What we did here, and how we carried out this technique,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I will tell you now.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
The first thing to do is to choose the criteria

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
by which you will assess the segments.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
In this case, the criteria were chosen together with the company's manager,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
with its commercial director,

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
because who, as not the company's manager or commercial director,

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
knows well what they are focused on,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
working in this area and in this industry.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
That is, the criteria can be changed,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
you can add or somehow correct,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
it's all up to you.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
The criteria are selected for the market.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
What criteria did we choose here?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
The first is, of course, the trend of market development.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Is the market growing, falling or stagnating?

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
This is important, because it provides an understanding

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
of how to develop further,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
what to do next with your product.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
The next criteria are the dynamics of sales on the market,

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
that is, how sales are going in each segment.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
They can be completely different.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
The next is the market capacity.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
How much has been sold in this region,

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
in this segment in the past planned period,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
for example, in a year?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
The next is the long-term prospects.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
How attractive will the market be in the future?

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
How seriously can we continue to work with it?

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Or are these only short-term prospects?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
The next is the demand for payment.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Is it growing or falling?

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
Yes, of course, many companies can want to buy our products,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
but whether they have money for this is a question.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
Therefore, the availability of payable clients is evaluated here.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
The next is the attractiveness of the product itself.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Is our product interesting for these clients?

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
This is a very important point and is rarely evaluated.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
In fact, it is important, because if another product is attractive for them,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
then they will simply not be interested in ours,

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
and then our points will be very low in this segment.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
Two more criteria are the influence of buyers and the influence of seasonality.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
I want to note that the assessment here is done in reverse.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
The stronger the influence, the less the assessment.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
Because the stronger the influence of the buyer or seasonality,

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
the stronger we will have to adjust to this client and to the seasonality of sales.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
This will not ensure our stability.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Therefore, the assessment here will be in reverse.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
Another criteria is the existing retail network.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Imagine if you already have a retail network,

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
and it is very easy for you to sell to the same clients with whom you already work.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
The cost is less, the resources are optimized,

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
it is easier to work, it is easier to present your product.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
There are a lot of obvious advantages.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
Therefore, if you have a retail network in this region or in this segment,

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
we will certainly give high scores.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
Another criteria is the influence of substitute products.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
I want to say that this criterion is not included in every assessment,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
but since there is a specificity in the roofing market,

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
a lot of new substitute products come out,

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
which seriously reduce the attractiveness of the cipher,

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
which we evaluated for attractiveness.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
That is why this criteria was included in this assessment.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
What is done next?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
We have determined the criteria.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
We make a list of segments that we will evaluate.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
This can be done very simply.

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
We take our client base and look at which groups our clients are from.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
We divide them into groups.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
And, in fact, there may even be someone from the potential groups,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
where we want to go, but have not yet gone.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
We can also put them here.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
We choose segments.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
There are several segments here.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
This is industrial construction, commercial construction and rural construction.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
We have designated all these segments in different sections.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
We have also agreed with the commercial director.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
And then we set the scores.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
You have a column.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
This is the maximum number of points.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
If you pay attention, they are not even.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
That is, it is not all 10 points, or all 12, or all 15.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
These are just points, taking into account the weight coefficients.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
The more important the criteria, the more points it costs.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
This is the maximum that can be.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
And then you evaluate each segment, each criterion.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
You score.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
I want to say that this is not just a mathematical game.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
When we sat down, scored and got the result.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
Before such segmentation is carried out, a serious market analysis is required.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
This is really so.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
That is, before scoring, we evaluated all these segments.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
We carried out a detailed analysis.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
And only after that, the points were scored in the form of an expert council.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
These were managers who work in this market, sales managers.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
These were marketologists.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
These were people who conducted additional research.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
And only on the basis of a common opinion, a point is set.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
Because otherwise you will get a mathematical assessment with calculations that do not give real results.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I want to pay special attention to this.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
That is, of course, research is required here.

47:13.000 --> 47:21.000
When the points are set, we simply add up all the points for each column, for each segment.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
We get the total amount.

47:23.000 --> 47:30.000
And we see that the segments that scored the most points are attractive for us.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
On the first table, on the slide, you have an example of the Moscow region.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
This is, of course, an example for the cipher.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
We evaluated the cipher, as I said, on the blood clot market.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
In fact, the assessment took place in several regions.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
And each of them had such a table.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
And then everything was combined into a general final matrix.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
And this matrix, you have it on the slide, there are 6 regions marked there.

47:57.000 --> 48:06.000
We evaluated the Moscow region, the Krasnodar Territory, the Volgograd region, the Ulyanovsk region, the Republic of Mordovia, and the Sverdlovsk region.

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
These 6 regions were chosen by the director because there are cipher plants there.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
That is, they were dancing from this, and therefore these regions were evaluated.

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
And here you see all the points that are combined for each of the segments.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
What did we do next?

48:24.000 --> 48:31.000
We highlighted those segments that are target for us in pink.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
That is, these are the ones that scored the most points.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
That's where the companies need to go first.

48:39.000 --> 48:46.000
Everything that is slightly lower in points, in yellow, are additional segments.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
When the targets are worked out, we start working on these segments, not earlier.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Everything else is cold sales.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
If customers come from there, please, we will provide them with sales.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
If not, we will not look for customers there, we will not spend on this segment.

49:03.000 --> 49:09.000
Because it is a waste of resources, dispersion, and simply a failure to achieve the goal.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Because we are going to the wrong place, where we want to be seen.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
I want to give a very serious example about cipher.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
We often do not segment the market at all.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Why? Because it seems to us that it does not matter.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
We sell to customers, we have these groups, we already know them all.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
And why should we spend time on obvious things again?

49:32.000 --> 49:40.000
Just in the example with cipher, we got an example from the cycle of obvious and incredible.

49:40.000 --> 49:49.000
When we started researching the market, of course, we were mostly aiming at the Krasnodar Territory, Volgograd region.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
Why? Because there is a very large number of private sector.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
This is the first point.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
And the second point is that the payment capacity of the population is not so high.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
The third point is that cipher is very suitable for the seabed.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
And in the Krasnodar Territory, of course, we have the sea.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
So, it is not subject to corrosion, it serves for a long time.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
And it is a wonderful material for these regions.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
But when we made an assessment, you see on the table, there is not a single pink square.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
There is not a single target segment.

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
We even had doubts, maybe we were wrong somewhere, or we did not finish something in this segmentation, or we made a wrong assessment.

50:29.000 --> 50:39.000
We even organized a business trip again, we went to the region again to find out the situation, why this is happening, why no one wants to buy cipher there.

50:39.000 --> 50:46.000
But the first thing we came across was that we looked through all the media that have been released in the last five years,

50:47.000 --> 50:54.000
we dug into the libraries and saw a very interesting PR campaign that was conducted by Western colleagues, Europeans.

50:54.000 --> 51:04.000
Europeans do not produce cipher, because they do not have an asbestos deposit, in which cipher is made.

51:04.000 --> 51:13.000
But they produce other blood materials that behave wonderfully, are used very well, but they are simply more expensive than cipher, of course.

51:13.000 --> 51:20.000
So, they conducted a very serious PR campaign there, about the harm of cipher to human health.

51:20.000 --> 51:30.000
That cipher, exposed to the sun's rays and high temperatures, releases carcinogenic substances, settles in the lungs and leads to cancer.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
In fact, there were opinions of experts, and so on, that is, it was a very large-scale campaign.

51:36.000 --> 51:52.000
In fact, there is a harmful asbestos, there are two types of deposits in the world, but the asbestos, the chrysotile, from which our cipher is produced, is not harmful at all.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
There are all certificates, all medical confirmations, and so on.

51:55.000 --> 52:03.000
Nevertheless, the PR campaign was held, people thought that, in fact, the cipher is harmful, we will not use it.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
However, the PR campaign never continues for five years, it is a maximum of two years.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
Generations change, families change, people change, we understand this perfectly.

52:12.000 --> 52:19.000
And we realized that there was another reason, not only that the PR campaign was held.

52:19.000 --> 52:27.000
We went further, held a secret buyer auction, and, in fact, walked through the shops, through the markets where cipher is sold.

52:28.000 --> 52:37.000
And when we just told the sellers that we needed a blood coat, we did not say what, we were offered anything except cipher.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
Well, we noted this trend and, in fact, called them to talk.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
An interview was held, and we found out the following moment.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
When we asked, why don't you offer cipher?

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
They said, yes, you are what, cipher is harmful to health.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
Well, then we started looking for a source, how did they know this, who actually told them this.

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
They could not remember this five years ago and repeat it all, the remaining five years.

53:02.000 --> 53:10.000
We found out the following moment, that there is a university in the Krasnodar Territory, which teaches construction specialists.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
And there a professor from Europe teaches.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
And the subject of the blood coat is just this professor from Europe teaches.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
And he tells all students that cipher is harmful to health.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
He does not explain to anyone what cipher is, chrysotile or some other.

53:27.000 --> 53:35.000
And, you know, the competition is at the level of the institute, at the level of students who are just being released into life.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
That is, it already turns out that cipher is harmful.

53:39.000 --> 53:47.000
Young people do not offer cipher, because they say, yes, you are what, you will die if you put it.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Actually, such a situation was found out.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
This is the level of competition.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
And this is a good example for us, at least, how to run a business.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
But here, what decisions were made.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Well, the first one.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
In the Krasnodar Territory, in the Volgograd region, there are two very serious cipher plants.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
And they are not to be put anywhere.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
Cipher transportation is associated with certain difficulties, it is fragile, it breaks.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
And, of course, it was decided to sell cipher only to the industry.

54:15.000 --> 54:21.000
Not to go out at all to end consumers, because it is pointless to break the logic of people.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
It is impossible, practically, these are very large costs.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
And in all other regions, you can already work with private clients.

54:29.000 --> 54:35.000
Here, such a story happened, so I sincerely recommend you to carry out segmentation.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
Find out where you have target segments, where they are not.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And not just fantasize about this topic.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Because it really gives a real result.

54:43.000 --> 54:48.000
Well, dear colleagues, I want to offer you another method that is suitable for industrial markets.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
Segmentation method with those criteria that we just considered.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
Here are all the criteria that we listed for industrial markets.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
This is the number of clients in the segment, this is the availability of the segment, its volume,

55:02.000 --> 55:08.000
the dynamics of the growth of this segment, stability or influence of seasonality,

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
the level of competition and the ability to protect on this market.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Here I will give you an example on another market.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
This is the elite alcohol market.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
We chose 7 segments that we evaluated.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
What were the segments?

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
The first is the wholesale segment, these are our dealers and distributors.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
The second segment is retail networks.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
Since they are doing a special job, of course, they are allocated to a separate segment.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
The next three segments are retail stores, but they are all of different categories.

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
Category A means separate supermarkets, large self-service stores, shopping centers.

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
Category B is medium-sized and small self-service stores.

55:49.000 --> 55:57.000
And category C is retail stores, small or maybe not very small, but working with retail.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
Two more segments are wholesale.

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
Wholesale is different from dealers and distributors in that they buy from us unstable.

56:05.000 --> 56:12.000
Today they can buy a very high turnover and, one might say, pull on the sales of dealers.

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
But it's not today that they made such a purchase, and tomorrow they may not come to us at all.

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
Dealers make a contract and must carry out purchases or sales with a certain periodicity.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Well, another segment is restaurants.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
And what do you call it? Entree?

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
We chose seven segments for the assessment.

56:34.000 --> 56:41.000
And I want to say that here, just as when you conduct an assessment, if you work in different regions,

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
then in each region the table will be different, because regions are very different from each other,

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
have their own specifics, so the assessment was carried out independently in each region.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
The assessment was carried out as follows.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
The assessment was set for each segment and for each criterion.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
The maximum is 10 points, the minimum is 1 point.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
The better the situation, the more points.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
And the weight criteria were also involved here.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
The weights are very simple.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
It's 1, 2 and 3.

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
The higher the point, the more interesting this criterion is for us.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.000
That is, we arranged the criteria and said that the most important thing for us is the number of clients in the segment,

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
the volume of the segment, the profitability and the level of competition,

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
because it all affects the financial result.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
Then we arranged the criteria, which are of the second degree of importance,

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
and the least important criteria, we assigned them a weight of 1.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
What was done next?

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
When you have put all the points, you multiply the weight by the point for each column,

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
then add it all up and calculate the average arithmetic.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
What will you get?

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
As a result, you choose your target segments.

57:57.000 --> 58:04.000
You can see that the most interesting segments for us are, of course, retail stores of category B,

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
networks, dealers and distributors.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
But this is one of the regions where we conducted such an assessment.

58:11.000 --> 58:16.000
On the next slide you can see a summary table for segments.

58:17.000 --> 58:24.000
It shows in which segment which channels are the most interesting for us.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
And, in fact, according to such an analysis,

58:28.000 --> 58:33.000
you can very clearly build a strategy for the development of a company in a particular region.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
As an example, you can see the results.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
If we look at the regions that are presented here,

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
we can see that the biggest points were obtained by the channels of the restaurants.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
The market for restaurants is very active today.

58:49.000 --> 58:55.000
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg scored the highest number of points in the restaurant segment.

58:55.000 --> 59:01.000
The next segment is the segment of retail networks and distributors.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
And if we take, for example, Lipetsk and Ryazan, we will see a completely different picture.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
In Ryazan and Lipetsk, it is very good to work with dealers and distributors.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
And the next one is the category C stores.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
No matter how strange it is, we got such results.

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
And thanks to the fact that we saw where we needed to take action,

59:23.000 --> 59:28.000
we developed the strategy of our company's actions for the next planned period.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
When you have determined the target segments,

59:32.000 --> 59:41.000
the next step you should take is to determine the consumer characteristics that are important for each segment.

59:41.000 --> 59:48.000
Not all segments need to be determined.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
The main thing is to do it for the target segments.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
And we have an example here.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
The consumer characteristics for the target segment are dealers and distributors.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Look what is there.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
In the first place, of course, the price and discounts.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Naturally, a dealer and distributor earn money,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
so financial conditions of the deal are very important for them.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And they always stand first in this category of customers.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
The next places, importantly, took the expiry date of the order and the quality of the products.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Naturally, our distributor is responsible for the quality, and the expiry dates are just as important.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And you can see and look at the following characteristics yourself.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
In fact, for each target segment, you have to do such things

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
in order to make commercial offers based on these things.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I would like to give you another example of segmentation.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
This is the well-known method of automatic detection and interaction.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
A very simple method, in fact, despite the complexity of its name.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
When we just determine which segments can be our buyers, which are not.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And I will give you an example on consumers of electronic lighters.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Such a device is designed to ignite gas in gas stoves at home.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
The lighter has its own features.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
We have piezo-lighters that work on a piezoelectric element.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
There are electric ones that plug into a socket and turn on.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And we can use them.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And here is an electronic lighter.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It is very convenient and interesting.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So we had to understand who our consumers could be.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And we, using the method of automatic detection,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
have listed our main consumers.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We took all consumers of electronic lighters and divided them into at least two parts.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Who can they be?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
The first is all the households that we have in our country.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And we divided them into two parts.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Those who have gas stoves and those who do not have gas stoves.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Of course, those who do not have gas stoves are not needed for analysis.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Next, we take the owners of gas-powered apartments and divide them by income level.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
The income level is divided into three parts according to the statistics.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Low income level, medium income level, high income level.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And then we conducted a phone survey.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And you can see four groups of criteria here.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
These were matches, piezo-lighters, electric ignition, which is built into a gas stove, and so on.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Someone found it difficult to answer, someone uses an electric lighter, someone uses a regular one.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000
That is, everything else that did not fall under these categories, it just got into this segment.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And we divided it by percentage based on the results of the survey.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.000
You see that 69% of the population, the owners of gas-powered apartments, use matches with a low income level.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
18% use piezo-lighters, and 11% use other devices.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
In fact, the most attractive segment for us is piezo-lighters.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Why?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Because people who already use such devices can switch to a more attractive product.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And those who use matches will hardly buy our electric lighters.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Well, someone will probably.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
This is a segment with the possibility of partial consumption, as we have designated it.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And the target segment is, of course, the piezo-lighter segment.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
The average income level.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
As we have divided it, look, the matches, piezo-lighters, electric ignition were divided approximately equally.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
That is, people with an average income level buy new gas stoves that have a built-in electric ignition.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And, in fact, they were divided into approximately three parts.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
If you look, you will see that in the target segments we have chosen piezo-lighters and electric ignition.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And you probably have a question, what does electric ignition have to do with it?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
They already have it.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Why do they need your lighters?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
The fact is that the plates here are not of the highest quality.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Electric ignition often fails.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And when it fails, to repair this stove, it is necessary to spend a lot of time,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
the master invites, this stove is taken away, and so on.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That is, there are a lot of questions.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And people very often leave the stove as it is.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And they have to use something else.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
That is, our piezo-lighters, or rather our electric lighters, will just fit.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, actually, with a high income level,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
we see here that piezo-lighters take up only 22%,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and 58% is electric ignition.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And people who have electric ignition have not come here,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
because the plates here are of high quality, they rarely break,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and they do not need it at all.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000
That is why we see everything that is marked in yellow is the target segments on the graph,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
on our scheme.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Everything that is marked in blue is segments with the possibility of partial consumption.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
That is, people can be switched.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
This is how the automatic detection method of interaction works.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Any market can be marked.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
In this way, target segments of the market can be segmented and allocated for themselves in the same way.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Well, dear colleagues, we have considered various segmentation methods.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And you have a very wide choice of which method to choose.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The only thing I want to say is that segmentation,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
no matter how long it takes, always gives amazing results,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
because it allows you to optimize resources and focus on your target buyers,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
on those who really need and need your product,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
and, of course, to achieve your goals that you have set for yourself for some planned period.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
What is the role of segmentation in the purchase of products?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Next, we will consider the behavior of the buyer,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
how it affects the purchase of our products.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
There is a mixture of psychology, business, economics,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
but nevertheless it is important to know, it is important to study our buyers,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
to understand when, where, why and how they make our purchases.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Otherwise, we will never be able to provide them with what they really want.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Let's start with you to consider this topic from the types of buyer behavior.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
There are four types of buyer behavior,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and we will take turns now to see what the difference is.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The first is complex buyer behavior.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It is characterized by the following things.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
First, the buyer understands that he needs to buy something.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
For example, this applies to some serious equipment.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
For example, he needs to buy a computer.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
He still does not understand the technical characteristics,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
he does not understand what kind of ASU he needs,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
how much memory he needs,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
what processor should be with what frequency, and so on.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
For him, these characteristics may be a dark forest.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
He does not understand.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
He needs a computer in order to perform certain functions.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
In order to understand what kind of computer he needs,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
he needs to understand.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Thus, he gets involved in the process of buying,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
understands, begins to consider different options,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
forms some attitude to the product,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and only then buys.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
That is, a very long preliminary choice.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This is what characterizes complex buyer behavior.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Expensive purchases and very serious preliminary work on the choice of a product.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And only then buys.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The next type is a buyer behavior that smooths out the dissonance.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The name is very interesting.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
What is it?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Here we also address expensive goods.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
For example, furniture or expensive interiors.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
What does the buyer do here?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Here he also walks around, chooses,

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
but he may not be particularly familiar with the technical characteristics,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
because he pays attention to other things here.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Design, appearance, and so on.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
He may also walk through the stores,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
but he will still make a choice.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Most often, this choice does not last long.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
That is, the buyer quickly looked through the possible offers,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
made a choice, bought, and only then begins to understand.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It was necessary to buy another sofa,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
because there are very rigid springs here.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Or maybe the material is very brandy,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
and he doesn't like it at all.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Or maybe he liked everything,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
and he is satisfied with the purchase.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
That is, here he buys first,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
and only then forms a relationship with the product.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Actually, this is exactly what you need to focus on

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
when your product meets such criteria,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
such a type of buyer behavior.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
The next buyer behavior is familiar.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
These are everyday goods.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
When we don't choose, we know what we need.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
For example, we need salt or bread or sugar.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
We come to the store, buy it and leave quietly.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
That is, we choose what is on the shelf,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
without thinking about the quality characteristics.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
That is, everyday goods that do not require

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
a preliminary decision, reading articles, reviews,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
what kind of salt should be, how it affects the body, etc.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
That is, nothing happens.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Therefore, such a familiar buyer behavior.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
The next point is a buyer behavior

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
that is focused on a wide selection of products.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Here we approach branded goods.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Let's take, for example, chocolate candies or juice.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And we know several brands of them.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Today we can buy one,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
tomorrow another, the day after tomorrow a third.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Or maybe we are attached and buy only one brand.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
But here, the same products are not expensive,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
but still there is a low degree of involvement.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
That is, we do not really understand

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
what makes one brand different from the other.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
We react to external irritants

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
that the outside world sends us.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Advertising, the opinion of our colleagues,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
our friends, family members, etc.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
These are the four main types of behavior.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
What are they for?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
To understand how to approach the buyer,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
what to offer him and what to draw your attention to.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
What to draw the buyer's attention to.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
With the first complex behavior,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
when the buyer chooses, understands,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
very serious consultations are important.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Maybe even a product demonstration,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
how it works, what results it allows to get, etc.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Pre-preparation is very important here.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
This is what your advertising campaign

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
or promotion campaign should focus on.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
If we take the second type of buyer's behavior,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
which smooths out the dissonance.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Your task is to smooth out the dissonance

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
so that the buyer, having bought,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
can also inform you,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
show the pros and cons of your product.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
First, to make it easier for the buyer to choose.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And second, so that he can justify his expectations.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
You need to tell more about the product.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
If we take the third type of behavior,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
this is the usual buyer's behavior.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
There are various stimulants,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
but in general, if this is a product for everyday use,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
then there is no need for special advertising.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Because the product is already being bought.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
As long as it is well put on the shelf,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
well presented, and special effort is required

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
in merchandising and layout.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
If we take the buyer's behavior,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
which is focused on a wide selection of products,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
here the marketing goods come into play.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Marketing goods are not sold without a wide promotion program.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
You need to constantly support the brand,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
constantly remind yourself

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
that the buyer chose your product according to the brand.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Therefore, there are serious companies for stimulation,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
serious advertising investments.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Without this, you simply will not be able to survive

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
and work successfully on this market.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
That is why we evaluate all types of buyer's behavior.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
But this is a consumer market.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
There are some peculiarities.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
First, who buys a product?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Of course, organizations.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Organizations buy a product in order to get a profit.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Consumer characteristics are not so important for them.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
They need to satisfy their needs.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Earn money, optimize costs

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and fulfill the wishes of their next clients.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Another point.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
When buying an industrial product,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
several groups of people participate in the process of purchasing.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
These are different units of the functional company.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Here, of course, you need to take into account

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
the interests of all units.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Therefore, you need to agree on all levels

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
when buying a particular product.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Another point that is very important

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
is that the people who buy your product

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
have certain limits in the company.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
They must adhere to these limits.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Therefore, during negotiations,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
these limits must be taken into account.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Another point that characterizes the purchase

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
on the B2B market is the signing of contracts,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
pre-serious preparation,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
documentation, bills, invoices,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
pre-sales agreements,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and legal documents.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
This is a very detailed process of the transaction,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
which is not typical of the consumer market.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
How do decisions on the B2B market

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
decide whether a buyer should buy a product or not?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
A buyer goes through several stages

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
before making a purchase.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
What are these stages?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
First, we realize the problem, as everywhere else.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
We understand that we need some additional components

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
for our production.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
For example, we need to buy heating tins

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
for our thermal curtains,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
because the tins that were not suitable for us in quality.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
What do we do next?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
We describe the characteristics

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
of the heating tins that we need to buy.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
We evaluate the characteristics of the product,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
compare what we have now

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
and what we would like to have

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
in order to better understand our needs and requests.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Next, we look for suppliers,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
and there may be a lot of them on the market.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
We collect offers from all suppliers

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and then we have a meeting

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
and then we evaluate the products.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
We have all the offers,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
and we look for the best conditions,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
the best quality, the best service, etc.,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
taking into account all the restrictions

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
that we have for choosing a product.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Next, we develop a purchase procedure.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
What do we need to do?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
First, we conduct a test,

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
then we negotiate,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
then we sign a contract, etc.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
We describe the delivery and purchase procedures.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Then we make a deal,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
buy our product,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
and the final stage is the evaluation of the work of the supplier.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
This always happens,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
because the reliability of the supplier is very important in the industrial market.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
If something does not work,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
or is not delivered on time,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
or is not at the right price,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
or is not in the right conditions,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
we can change it quickly,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
because we have a lot of offers,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
we have chosen them.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Of course, it is great to choose suppliers on all markets,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
but there is always a choice

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
when you can change your decision

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and make a decision based on the behavior of the supplier.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
The model is just a description of the actions of the buyer

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
when making a purchase,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
that is, how he acts, where he goes, what he thinks, where he buys, etc.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
The model is very important for us

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
to determine the target groups of buyers,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
to determine the model of their purchase,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
and, in accordance with these models,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
to offer our product to the market.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
To determine the model,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
we must answer 7 main questions.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
1. Who are our buyers?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Who are the key ones?

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
This will help us to make a segmentation.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
We will immediately understand who we are focusing on

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
in the consumer and industrial markets.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
2. Are these products or goods that they are already buying?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
There is no empty market at all.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Our client has already purchased something.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Now we offer him another product,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
or an improved one, or at a better price, or with better service.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Therefore, we must understand

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
what is now in demand in the market,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
what our buyers are aiming for now.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
3. Why do they buy this product?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
What are their goals?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
What do they need it for?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
According to the theory of consumption,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
people, buyers, and clients buy products in two cases.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
The first is to satisfy their needs.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
We will see what they are later.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
This is the first point.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And the second is to enjoy it.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
There can only be two reasons

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
that make us do certain actions.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Satisfaction of needs and enjoyment.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
4. What is the goal of the buyer when he chooses and looks for your product?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Who is involved in the purchase process?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
This is also important to know.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
As it happens, if we work in the industrial market,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
there are a lot of participants

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and a lot of decision-making levels.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Everyone needs to talk to everyone,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
understand the tasks and goals of everyone,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
and make a complex proposal that will suit all the levels of the company

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
that is going to buy your product.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Let's see if this is the end consumer.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Who makes the decision here?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Let's take a simple example.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
When March 8 comes,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
men buy flowers, champagne, sweets,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
or when they go to visit a friend.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
In theory, champagne or wine they buy for women.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But they choose.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
What does the buyer do?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Or a case with a bicycle.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
If you buy a bicycle for your son or daughter,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and your son or daughter are still schoolchildren,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
of course, they will probably express their wishes to you.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
What do they want to see?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
What kind of bicycle do they want?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
But you will make the decision, because you pay.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
It is important to determine who makes the decision and who buys.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
What is the process of buying?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
What operations are carried out in the industrial market?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
What is the sequence of actions?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
How does the process of buying,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
the process of choosing, the process of identifying,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
that is, the identification of your product,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and the decision-making process take place?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
The next question is when do they buy?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And why at these moments?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Is there a time, for example, morning or evening?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Is it associated with a holiday?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Is it associated with a season?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
It is very important to understand when most of the consumers buy your product.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Because at this time you can make additional shares,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
attract additional customers,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
and increase your sales, of course.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And the last point is where.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
At what trading points?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
At what trading points and which customers

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
can your customers find their product?

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
In fact, this is a very rare question we ask ourselves.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It seems to us that we know all the sales channels.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
But today juices are sold in pharmacies, for example.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Although this is not a grocery store,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
this is an additional channel of sales.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
In the same way, you can think about where else we can present our product.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Where else can we offer it or sell it?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Perhaps this is even a better channel of sales than the one we have today.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Because on our channel today we have a very high level of competition.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
And if we go to some other segment,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
maybe there we will look very good.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
In the same way, many companies sell cosmetics in pharmacies

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and position their brand as a therapeutic cosmetic.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Although maybe it has nothing in common with the therapeutic one.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Nevertheless, they position it as an elite product,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
expensive, which is sold only in pharmacies.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
And we usually have more trust in pharmacies than in stores.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
These are the steps you need to consider

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
to determine the model of customer behavior.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
When you describe each of these steps

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
to your target customers,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
you will see how the purchase is going,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
what your customers are focused on, what they pay attention to.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And it will be very easy for you to decide

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
how to work further, how to achieve your goals.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Before the customer makes his purchase,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
he will think about many things.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Maybe he will compare something in his head.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Maybe he will consult with someone.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Because a lot of factors affect decision-making.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And we will look at four groups of factors

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
that have a particularly serious impact on our decision-making.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And the first factor is, of course, the cultural level of a person.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
What is his social status?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Where did he grow up?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
What did he get from childhood?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
How did he get used to behaving?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
What does he like and what does he not like?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Of course, a lot depends on this.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And maybe in his culture it is not customary

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
to consume certain products.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Accordingly, we will not offer them here.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Culture sometimes plays a role in this.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
The next group of factors is social factors.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
What does it mean?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Referendums, family, status of a person, his role in life.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
We play a lot of roles in life.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
We play different roles.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
At work we have one role, in the family another.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
With our parents we play a completely different role.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
We are already a son or a daughter, although we are adults.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
We are not a mother, we are not a father.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Therefore, we need each role.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
In each role we make our purchases.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
If we buy something for our children,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
we buy it with one feeling.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
If we buy something for our colleagues,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
there may be completely different motives.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I want to say that everything that surrounds us,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
all social factors, including referendums,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
who are they?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Some famous people, media,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
who tell us about a certain product

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
or show that they use it.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
This affects our opinion.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Or a doctor recommends a medicine.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
We listen to their opinion.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
We listen to the opinion of our family members.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
If it is so accepted in your family.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And we make purchases according to our role and status.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Such factors should be taken into account.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
There are two more groups of factors.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
The first is the personal order factor.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
This is all that we imagine.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
This is our age, this is the stage of our life cycle,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
the stage of the life cycle of our family.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Either we are a young family,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
or we have grown up,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
or we have children,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
or we have children who have already left the parental nest.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Different stages are described in sociology.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And of course, at each stage we make different purchases.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
We have different needs.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
And taking this into account,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
we can offer our products to our clients in the same way.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Another group of factors is the factors of psychological order.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
What do we mean by this?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
What is our attitude to something?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
What has already been imbued with us?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Or what do we imagine, what opinion do we have about this product?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
If we know that a company produces a very good product,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and we are firmly convinced of this,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
then we will buy it.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Maybe no one will convince us.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Or maybe we will have some kind of motivation.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
When a company conducts some promotion campaign,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
we will have a motive to try something new,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
to move away from the standard brand that we always use.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
These are our personal characteristics, our personal feelings,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
our mood, even the moment when we make a purchase.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
A lot depends on the mood.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Therefore, of course, these factors need to be taken into account.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
But it is the factors of psychological order

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
that are most difficult to take into account.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
It is difficult to predict a person's mood,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
and it is very difficult to immediately understand what is inside him,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
what is in his soul.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Therefore, the most complex group of factors,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
nevertheless, the first three we can determine completely clearly

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
and even take them into account when segmenting our clients.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Let's see what the model of customer behavior consists of.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
You have a diagram on the slide, which just describes all the factors

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
that affect customer behavior.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
The first thing we will see is external irritants, as they are called.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
These are marketing incentives.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
What does this include? The product itself, the appearance, packaging, service, etc.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Its price, which tells us how much we should pay

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
to purchase this product.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Naturally, this is also an incentive for us,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
if the price is attractive for us.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Next, where is it sold?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
This is also an incentive.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
If the store is very far away or the client is very far away,

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I will do it in a different way and will not reach the manufacturer or the store

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
that would like to attract me.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Therefore, the location or the place of sale is sometimes very important

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
when choosing, especially the goods of permanent use.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
This moment plays a decisive role.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And the promotion of the product.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
These are programs that the manufacturer or supplier conducts.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
These are ads, these are all articles,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
which are published on the Internet.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
This is a promotion, this is a promotion.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
This is a promotion.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
All this gives us a reason to remember about this product once again.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Maybe we should remember it when we come to buy something.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
We remember the impact of advertising,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
what we have missed on the price.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And we pay attention to a particular product.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
As external irritants and as an incentive,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
this is what we do when we buy.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Another group of motives is the incentive motive.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
What is included here?

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Economic, technological, political, cultural.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
The factors that we have already discussed.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Economic factors.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
What is included here?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Your ability to purchase this product.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
How does it correspond to your situation?

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Technical or technological.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
How convenient will it be for you to use this product?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
How will it suit you?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
How will you deal with it?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Political motive.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I will give an example of a political motive.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
For example, now we have a policy aimed at a healthy lifestyle.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Sport, skiing, tennis, etc.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Depending on what our politicians sell us.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And note, this also affects the quality of life.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Because more and more people are engaged in skiing,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
more and more people are engaged in tennis, etc.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
The policy of the state influences the decision-making.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Cultural.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
What is accepted in our culture?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
What do we like and dislike?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
How were we brought up?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
This also depends on the motive of our purchase.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
When we look at the influence of all these factors,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
we can consider the process of decision-making.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
What happens?

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
First, as we said, a person or a company realizes the need.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You need to buy something.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
This is necessary.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
This makes you do it.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Either because there is a need,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
or to get pleasure.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Next, we conduct a search.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Not only a search for a product,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
but also for information about it.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Is it an expensive product or a product of a preliminary choice?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Then we evaluate the options we have.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
We choose what we need and buy.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
The last stage of the buyer's behavior

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
is evaluation and analysis.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
What did we buy?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Did we like it or not?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
How do we behave?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
If we liked the product,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
we go and buy it again.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Or we recommend someone to buy it,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
if we don't need a second purchase.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
But if we didn't like it,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
we share our impressions

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and don't recommend anyone to buy it.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
This is a very important point,

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
because it's very important

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
to satisfy your client.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
What decisions does the buyer make

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
after he or she buys your product?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
There can be many decisions.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
If he or she didn't like it,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
he or she chooses other products,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
other brands,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
or he or she chooses another seller

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
because there can be different claims of the client.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Then he or she evaluates

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
how much time he or she needs to buy.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Even if he or she didn't like your service,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
but it's easier for him or her to work with you,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
maybe he or she will come back to you

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
only because he or she will save his or her time.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And, of course, he or she will evaluate the cost of the purchase.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
And not only the price of the purchase,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
but also the cost of the whole purchase.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
For example, when you buy an air conditioner at home

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
or in a company,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
the cost of the equipment is the same.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Then the cost of the installation is added.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
This is an additional cost.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And then the cost of service is added.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
The same is true for your cars.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
We buy a car,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
we pay for the service,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
we pay for additional parts,

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
we pay for repairs, for gasoline, etc.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
The client always evaluates the total cost of the purchase.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Whether we want it or not.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Therefore, it is very difficult to attract the client

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
with the initial small price.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
The client is already very competent in consumption

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
and evaluates the total cost of the purchase.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Because they have a limit,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
they have clear instructions

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
what the price of the product should be

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
and what its cost of service should be.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Therefore, the model must be taken into account.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
It is important and it gives you the opportunity

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
to see your customers in more detail, more clearly.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And I want to say again,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
offer them the product they really need.
