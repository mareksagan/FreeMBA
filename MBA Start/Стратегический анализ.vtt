00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Good afternoon. Imagine that you are a student of the Economic University, who studied the basic economic and management disciplines for two years,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the basics of macro and microeconomics, the basics of management, the basics of marketing, and so on.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, in general, he met with the university students.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now he needs to choose a specialization for himself in order to become a cool professional in the field.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It can be marketing, it can be logistics, it can be accounting, it can be controlling.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the student thinks about how to make this choice.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He looks at the coin and thinks that, in principle, this choice can be made strategically by throwing the coin.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If the coin falls to the floor and the eagle falls, then he can choose marketing for himself.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If it falls to the top, then he will choose logistics for himself.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If it hangs in the air, then it will be accounting.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If the coin is on the edge, then it will be controlling.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The second option is that he can look around, try to analyze what professions will be in demand in the market in the near future.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And also look inside, close your eyes and think about what talents and inclinations I have, what attracts me the most.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
If this is a creative personality, then, of course, he will choose accounting for himself, remembering such a term as creative accounting.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Companies, businesses often have the same situations when you understand that everything that has been so far cannot remain so and further.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You need to live differently and you think where to go, to the right, to the left or straight.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Companies often face the problem of a cardinal breakdown of the party's general line.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And in order to do this consciously, they have to do a strategic analysis.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Analysis of the external environment, analysis of oneself.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We will discuss the key tools that can be used to make this analysis.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
My name is Vladislav Tolkach. I am the director of the Academy of Controlling.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is the main place of my work.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This project is implemented by the joint efforts of the German School of Business and the Academy Controller.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I am a practicing business coach and consultant.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I specialize in the topic of strategy, organizational development and, of course, controlling.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The main tools of strategic analysis that we will discuss are used to understand the environment of the external environment in which our company operates.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
There is a PEST analysis, or it is also called STEP.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is an abbreviation of four English words.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This is an analysis of the political, economic, social and technological environment.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If you make an abbreviation, it turns out either PEST or STEP.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The second tool allows you to understand your industry.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Here I must mention the work of the guru of strategic management, Michael Porter,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
who, for the sake of understanding his industry, recommends to businessmen to analyze competition, as well as the power of substitutes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.000
These are products from adjacent industries that can gnaw money from the pie that we and our competitors in our industry claim.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Here is the analysis of customers and suppliers.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The fifth tool is the so-called entry barriers.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This is what prevents potential players from breaking into our industry.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
The third tool is the analysis of the factors of success in the industry.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
In principle, it is a summary of the entire previous work.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
When we rewrite all the issues that should be solved in our industry, if we want to earn something,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
we need to work on them.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
However, these issues are usually divided into two parts.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The first part is the basic issues that allow us to play football,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
allow us to play on the football field, but do not guarantee us a win.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
The second part is the so-called strategic issues.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
If we work strategically, we have a chance to win football.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
The fourth tool is the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This is the analysis of the company itself, what is good and what is not very good at the moment.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The summary tool that summarizes the entire previous analytical work is the so-called SWOT analysis.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This is again an English-language abbreviation.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.000
These four letters mean again the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the list of threats, opportunities and threats.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The last part of our course is the organizational aspects.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We will talk about how to do this analysis better, who to call to a strategic meeting, how to distribute roles.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
These are the nuances that we will discuss in the last part.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
In the 1970s, the Armenian radio was asked if a snake could break its spine.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The Armenian radio thought and replied that a snake could break its spine if it crawled along the party's general line.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Sometimes the company experiences a stage of a radical break in the party's general line,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
when the leadership comes to work on Monday and says,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
guys, everything is wrong, everything we do is wrong, it was right before, but it is not right in the future.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We must remake our strategy, remake our business model, go another way, otherwise we will not survive.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Imagine that you are a distributor of body care, home chemistry, cosmetics, and you are in a tight spot.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
On the one hand, the factory is pressuring you, twisting your hands at the price and payment conditions.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
On the other hand, the clients are pressing you harder, who also twist your hands at the price and payment conditions.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
In addition, the competition is getting tougher, and you understand that you cannot live like this.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
You understand that you have three options as a distributor.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Either go into production, or go into logistics, become a cool logistics operator, or create your own business.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The second example is also about this.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
The company produces lasers.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Until some point, it felt good in the industry, but everything changes, competition changes, suppliers change, clients change.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The management of the company understands that it is impossible to live as we used to live.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I drew three scenarios for myself.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The first scenario is the so-called operational perfection, when the company will bet on a standard mass laser,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to produce lasers in a very narrow range, focusing on the mass market, and polishing its logistics and production.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
At the same time, the business cannot boast of innovative ideas, it is unlikely that it can boast of an amazing service or a strong brand.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.000
The second scenario is the product management, which usually involves huge investments in new-ocre, in the final development.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Some of these investments go to waste, but some of them are likely to be successful,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and the company offers the market an absolutely innovative product, an absolutely innovative laser,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and can remove the cream from this product for some time.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The third scenario is customization,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
offering a laser to a client with very sharp edges,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
because this is what the client wants,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
according to Feng Shui, this is correct, when the laser has round corners and yellow color,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
as well as a specific lamp that the client wants to see.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
There are three ways to go, operational perfection, product management, or int-poshiv.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
But the company cannot go in three ways at the same time, due to the limitation of all types of resources.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The third example is the company working on the ice cream market.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
In recent years, the ice cream market has not grown very intensively, and at the moment it is not growing at all.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
At the same time, another direction has grown, the so-called cold logistics,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that is, cold transport, in which you can transport ice cream, dumplings, frozen vegetables,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and warehouses where all this can also be stored.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
This cold logistics has grown to the same volume in terms of revenue and profit as ice cream.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000
If you do this closely, you can earn a lot, because the market is still quite raw.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And again, the company thinks about how to live further, whether we need this ice cream,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
or whether we should become operators in the cold logistics market.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
All these three companies, in order to make a conscious strategic choice,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and develop a competitive strategy that is understandable for themselves and for their employees,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
must make a so-called strategic analysis at the stage number 0.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The logic of this strategic analysis is presented on this slide.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
In a nutshell, it consists of two main tasks,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
this is a strategic analysis of the external environment and a strategic analysis of the company itself.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
When we analyze the external environment, we usually use two tools.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
This is the analysis of the PEST factors, this is the so-called analysis of the remote environment.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The company looks at the policy and legal factors that can influence its work in the near future.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
The company tries to understand how the economic environment will behave in which it works.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
The company tries to understand the factors of social nature.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And the company tries to understand the factors of technological nature.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But this is the so-called remote environment.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In addition, there are factors of the so-called near environment,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
which are very well described in the works of Michael Porter,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and are known as the five-force model.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
The first is the competition in the industry,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and the power of the substitutes is the clients and suppliers,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
as well as the analysis of the entry barriers that prevent the emergence of new players in the industry.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
If we use these two tools,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000
we will get a good understanding of what is happening and will happen in our external environment.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
In addition, in order to develop a strategy,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
you need to understand your own strengths and weaknesses,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
what is already good and what is not very good.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
For these purposes, I recommend the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
which can be done in the format of the so-called chain of value creation.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The fourth point is, as a rule, the requirements of the owners,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
financial and non-financial,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
can significantly affect the strategic choice and the business model

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
that the employee management is trying to implement in practice.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000
The results of all these analyses can be summarized in the final summary document,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
which is called the SWOT analysis,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and represents a set of strengths and weaknesses,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
opportunities and threats listed on a piece of paper in the A4 format,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
in the One Page Only format.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
After that, we can assess and weigh the further paths of our own development.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
We can assess whether we will go into production, logistics, or our own retail,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
or we will go into operational improvement, product leadership, or int-poshiv.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
After weighing the alternatives, we will make our own strategic choice.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So, the analysis of external environment factors,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
which consists of two sections,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
the analysis of the factors of the distant environment and the analysis of the factors of the near environment.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
When analyzing the factors of the distant environment,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
we can use the PEST or STEP model.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I repeat that this is an abbreviation of four English words.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
The political-legal environment is the letter P,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the economic environment is the letter E,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the letter S is the factors of the social environment,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and the letter T is technology.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
What do we analyze at the stage of the analysis of political-legal issues?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
We try to understand how much the law that operates in the external environment

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
can affect our business.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
We try to predict how it will change,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
in a positive or negative direction.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
The second point is to understand how seriously the state can interfere in our business.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The third point is to understand how great the level of corruption in the market we work in is.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We ask ourselves questions like this

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
before developing a strategy,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
trying to understand our political-legal environment.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
A small example on this topic.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Ukraine is a market for buildings made of fast-mounted metal structures.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
A construction company offers its customers buildings made of metal.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It can be a logistics center, a warehouse, a production facility,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
a hypermarket, a metal box.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
In 2005, the company felt very good,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
experienced a stage of rapid growth,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000
at the end of the year it rented a new office space with a margin,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and the sales plan for the next year was quite ambitious.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
But due to political reasons, the orange revolution,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
sales fell significantly next year.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Potential customers did not have less money,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
but they were afraid to invest in logistics centers,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
hypermarkets, real estate.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
They were waiting for the government's decision

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
on what was allowed and what was not allowed in Ukraine.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
They waited for almost a year,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and only in November of the following year,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
the company sales began to grow again.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:54.000
We understand how political factors can affect our success.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The letter E, the letter M, is the economy.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
We analyze inflation,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
we try to understand how the cost of capital on the market will change,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
whether capital will increase or decrease,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
we try to understand how unemployment will behave,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
what will happen in the labor market, and so on.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
The letter S is the social environment factors.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Here we analyze the demography on the market,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
we try to understand the cultural features of some markets,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
we can analyze the level of education on the market.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
These are the questions we discuss,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
analyzing the letter S, the social environment.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
The fourth section is the technological environment factors.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
The influence of the Internet on our business,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
the influence of new technologies in our industry,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
the influence of IT.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
These are the factors we analyze before developing a strategy.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
A small nuance.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
If a company operates in several markets,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I mean geographical markets,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
for example, it operates in the Russian market,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
in the Ukrainian market, in the Belarusian market,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and in the Polish market.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It may be that the letter P on these four markets

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
is quite different and affects the business in a very different way.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Again, the letter E, the economic factors,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
can be quite different on these markets

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and can also affect our business.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
The conclusion is that the company will have to pass this PEST analysis four times.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Pass the PEST analysis for the Russian market,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
for the Ukrainian, for the Belarusian, for the Polish,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
to understand all the nuances that it will have to consider

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
in the next two or three years if it wants to continue working on these markets.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
A small nuance.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
When we do a PEST analysis,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
we evaluate the positive or negative impact of all these

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
political, legal, economic, social and technological factors on our business.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
We must understand that the same factors

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
in companies from different industries can have a positive or negative effect

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
on some companies, have a neutral effect.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
For example, in Krzysztof Obloy's book

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
The Strategies of a Successful Company,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
which is recommended in the list of literature,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
there is a funny observation about how the factor on the letter S,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
namely the formation of the YAPI class,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Young Professionals,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
in Poland, has a very different effect on businesses from different industries.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
It is very positive for restaurants,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
for car and car salesmen,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
that young professionals are being formed in Poland.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
But companies that produce children's goods,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
diapers, children's food,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
they are in complete sorrow,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
because YAPI children are usually started late.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And if a company makes tractors,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
then the formation of the YAPI group has no effect on it.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And another nuance.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
When we do a PEST analysis,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
we do not just list the factors that affect us.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
We must immediately ask ourselves the question,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
what exactly a particular structural unit of our company should do,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
or, on the contrary, should not do, in response to the effect of this factor.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
In the materials, we have an example of a PEST analysis of a company that produces websites.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
It is engaged in web design.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
The company is located in one of the regional centers of the Russian Federation.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
There it has a production site and a central office.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
However, the company is interested in the Moscow market,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
and it has a representative here who works with clients

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
and, analyzing the PEST factors,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
the company, for itself, by the letter S,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
denotes a high degree of snobbery in public consciousness in Moscow.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
And we must immediately understand what this means for our business,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
for the individual structural units of our company.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
It means that the company should look like a Moscow one,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
it should have an office in Moscow,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
it should have a convincing client list,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
and sometimes for this you have to win a tender

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
to supply the site, for example, Coca-Cola or Procter &amp; Gamble for 1 euro.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
That is, the Coca-Cola company announces a tender,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I want a site,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.000
and the company we are considering won a tender for 1 euro,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
because it needs a convincing client list to work in the Moscow market.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
So, when we analyze the PEST factors,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
we always ask ourselves what this factor means for our company,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
how it will affect our company in the near future,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and what we should do and what we should not do in response to this factor.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
We have at least two examples from different industries in our materials.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
For each tool that we are considering,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
the first task that I recommend you to do is to conduct a PEST analysis for your company.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
You can find the image of those mini cases, those examples that are in our materials.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:59.000
PEST analysis of the Russian market with the eyes of the company that makes the sites,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
and the example of the PEST analysis of the Ukrainian market with the eyes of the company that works in the kitchen furniture market.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Please remember that if you have to work in several markets,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
you will most likely have to do several PEST analyses.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
For one market, PEST, and for another market, PEST.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And please remember that you do not just list that inflation is like this,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000
that the currency rate is like this, that unemployment is like this, and that the level of education is like this.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
You must immediately try to understand how this will affect your business in the near future,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
and ideally, even form a so-called to-do list, a list of what needs to be done in the near future

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
in order to take into account the effect of this factor.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:00.000
For example, the company sells spare parts and says that in recent years there have been more traffic jams on the streets of cities,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
and more and more often people began to buy Asian and American brands.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Such trends are on the market.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
What does this mean from the point of view of our strategy?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.000
This means that our product portfolio needs to include more spare parts for American and Asian cars.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Given that there are many traffic jams, the clutch breaks, the gearbox breaks,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
so the demand for these spare parts will most likely increase, and we will be able to sell more of them in the coming years.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
This is a specific conclusion for the product portfolio based on the results of the PEST analysis.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Please, not just a list of factors, but a list of what needs to be done in the next column.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
A so-called to-do list, a list of necessary actions,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
which can be immediately recorded in a document called a strategy.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
The next tool we will look at is the analysis of the factors of the near environment.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
This analysis is carried out using the model proposed by Michael Porter.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
This model is known as the Five Force model.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Michael Porter, explaining why the value of the profitability of the invested capital is average,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
in different industries, proposes the Five Force model.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
He says that the ROI, the profitability of the invested capital,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
depends on how the Five Force configuration is formed in the industry,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
how sharp the competition in this industry is, and how powerful the supply of spare parts is.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Spare parts are products from other industries,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
which can bite off a piece of the pie that we and our competitors claim.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
These are not our direct competitors, these are players from other industries,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
but they are able to pull the money of our clients.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
In principle, these are two similar forces, but Porter divides them into two parts.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
The first force is the competition, these are players in our industry.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
The second force is players from other industries,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
which are able to influence the situation in the industry in which we work with our competitors.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
The third force is clients, with whom we trade in terms of price and payment conditions,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
and suppliers, with whom we also trade in terms of price and payment conditions.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:56.000
The fourth force is the entry barriers, these are the brick walls that we ourselves or jointly build with our competitors.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
We can add barbed wire to the top, and a couple of machine tools with dogs,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
so that new players do not come to our industry.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
If we do this, then with other equal ROI, the profit of the invested capital will be greater.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
For example, IKEA, working in the Russian market, complains in an interview to a Russian magazine

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000
that local competitors have lobbied for high customs duties, which IKEA is forced to pay for customs.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Local Russian furniture makers lobbied for this regulatory act in their interests,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
and, in fact, they have taken their position in the industry with a fairly high brick wall.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
If they had not done this, the profit of the invested capital, with other equal ones, would have been less.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Let's try to understand how the configuration of 5 forces on the porter affects the assignment of the profitability of the invested capital in the industry.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:08.000
The German brewery industry, the competition in the beer market in Germany is the most severe for several centuries.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000
In 1516, the so-called Reinhardt's Code was adopted in Germany,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000
according to which beer can be called a drink consisting only of water, malt and hops.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
There can be no other components in beer.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:35.000
If there is ascorbic acid or orange zest in beer, then this drink should be called not beer, but something else.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Players in the industry work with the same set of resources, namely water, malt and hops.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Water is about the same, malt is about the same, hops are about the same.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
They need to be different from each other in at least one way or another, but in this industry this is quite difficult.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
We can say that all the niches and niches in the German brewery market are clogged for a long time.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.000
For example, in Bavaria there is the city of Bamberg, where a local player in the beer market produces the so-called Rauchbier,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
which can probably be translated into Russian as smoked beer.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000
This is beer that smells a little like smoke or smoked sausage.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000
No benzoles are added to the beer, this is water, malt and hops, this is Reinhardt's Code, the law of 1516.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:41.000
But the technology of making this drink itself obviously involves the use of some coals through which this beer is filtered,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
and as a result it smells a little like smoked sausage.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
That is, the niches and niches are clogged, the competition is fierce.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000
In addition, players in this industry have to reconcile, not reconcile, but reckon with the actions of the substitutes.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
This can be water, ordinary water, which the Germans drink more and more.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
It can be wines from the New World, Chilean, Argentinian, not only from the New World.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
It can be weak alcohol cocktails, it can sometimes even be ice cream.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:21.000
If you look at the sales, beer and other drinks on the German market,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
you can see that beer has been declining in recent years,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:34.000
and the volume of water consumption, the volume of wine consumption, the volume of weak alcohol cocktails, they are growing, and quite seriously.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
The younger generation of Germans says that beer is an old-fashioned dad's drink.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
This is the drink that the dad drinks when he comes home from work.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Well, for a young German, drinking an old-fashioned drink is not good, he must drink a weak alcohol cocktail.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
In other words, the power of substitutes, products from adjacent and other industries is also very high.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
The client. The client can be divided into two parts.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
These are retail networks that buy at this price and may not pay 180 days,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:25.000
and the end consumers, who, as we said, are not doing very well either, switching to other drinks, water, wine, and so on.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Suppliers.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Gold is constantly rising, copper is constantly rising, electricity is constantly rising.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Suppliers of equipment also spin beer makers' hands.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
In general, almost by the entire list of suppliers, everything is quite difficult.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
In such a heavy industry, the profitability of invested capital will obviously not be very high.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:05.000
There are probably not so many such sad industries, but we see how Michael Porter's theory of five forces explains what money we can count on working in the retail industry.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
We must understand our industry, we must understand how competition will affect us in the near future,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:22.000
how the power of clients will change, how the power of suppliers will change, what barriers there are and what barriers there may be.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
But we should not passively observe this.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000
We must try to actively influence all five forces, offer something unique to our clients,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:41.000
try to actively work with suppliers, try to be friends or go into niches, working with competitors.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.000
We must create entry barriers, create entry barriers alone or together with competitors,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
but one way or another, actively working across the entire list of five forces.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:03.000
So, when we analyze our industry, we try to understand how our competitors will behave in the near future,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000
whether players from other industries, replacement products, will affect the situation in our industry,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:21.000
how the power of clients will change, this is primarily the ability of clients to trade at a price and on payment terms,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:29.000
as well as the power of suppliers, again, the ability to trade with us at a price and on payment terms.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
The fifth force is the entry barriers that prevent the emergence of new players in our industry.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Typical questions that we analyze, using this tool on competition,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
are to understand the degree of sharpness of competitive struggle in our industry,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:59.000
to understand how consolidated players in our industry are, how the degree of consolidation will change in the near future.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:10.000
By analyzing the replacement products, we ask ourselves how much better or worse are the replacement products from other industries

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
in terms of price-quality ratio, if we compare it with the products that our industry produces.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:31.000
If we analyze our clients, we ask how great is the ability of our clients to bargain with us at a price and on payment terms.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000
We can imagine ourselves as a person who arranges armwrestling with a client and asks,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
can I win a client at a price and on payment terms, or the client wins me at a price and on payment terms.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
The same with suppliers, the same with armwrestling, the price of the purchase and the payment terms.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000
As for the entry barriers, everything is reduced to money, probably,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:11.000
but if we do not reduce everything to money and do not analyze only the size of the investments that we need to enter the industry,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:21.000
we can analyze, for example, legislative barriers, we can try to understand how deep in the consumer consciousness there are myths

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000
that the products that are offered on the market by already existing players are good,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:41.000
and we can try to understand how difficult it is for new players to get on the shelf in a retail store.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
In general, the barriers to entry can be all kinds, in principle, everything can be reduced to money,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:55.000
but there are factors that play a role besides financial factors.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
A small but important point.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000
In the 21st century, the boundaries of industries are erasing, and there are a lot of interesting businesses that are created at the junction of industries.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Imagine, there is a company that produces sites, namely, promotional sites,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
and, in principle, it works at the junction of two industries, the IT industry and the marketing industry.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:25.000
It offers the client not just a website, it offers him a tool for promoting its products on the market.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:38.000
There is a certain concept of promotion, there is a certain IT solution combined with ideas in the field of marketing.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
The conclusion is that a company, analyzing its industry, should, in fact, analyze two industries,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
the analysis of 5 forces for the IT industry and the analysis of 5 forces for the marketing industry.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
There is no other way.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Another example.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:01.000
The Controller Academy is a structure that was created in Germany in 1971 by Albrecht Dall.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:10.000
It is a business built at the junction of two industries, namely, business education, in particular, controlling, and tourism.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:21.000
The Controller Academy offers the client a mix between new knowledge and a cool vacation in the Alps in Bavaria.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:30.000
It offers the client to come to them for a week, get new knowledge, get communication with colleagues from other industries,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:42.000
get new ideas, and also spend time in nature, a clean lake, delicious Italian food, a pleasant atmosphere.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
This is the so-called edutainment.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Again, the junction of two industries, in this case, business education and the recreation industry.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Again, a company operating in this business should, in fact, analyze two industries,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
namely, business education and recreation industry.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
The third example you see on this slide is a company that produces inter-room doors.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.000
It has a production site, and the product made in this production site is transferred to dealers

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
or to its own structures that are engaged in wholesale sales.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:34.000
In the end, the door goes to the retail market, and the company dreams of its own retail market, but so far it does not have one.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:46.000
It has several production sites, and it has several wholesale structures that can buy on their own production sites, but can also buy from competitors.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:54.000
In principle, again, analysis of two industries is necessary, analysis of 5 forces for the production part of the company,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
because wholesale structures are the clients for the production part of the company.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
And the second analysis is necessary for players in the wholesale market,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:13.000
because the client for them is already the retailer, and the end customer who buys an inter-room door,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
the supplier is not a wood supplier for the production part of the company,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
but a production structure that makes a ready-made inter-room door.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
And again, analysis of 5 forces for two industries is necessary.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:35.000
The next nuance. When we analyze competition, as a rule, we have to divide competitors into so-called strategic groups.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000
A strategic group is a group of players of the same industry, which are similar to each other by some criteria.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000
For example, if we analyze the industry in which sites are made, we can divide the players in the industry into more or less homogeneous groups,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
drawing a simple matrix in which there are two variables.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
One variable will be the creativity of the sites, that is, how creative the site is.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
It can be highly creative, medium-creative, or low-creative.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And the second variable is the so-called technological ability of the site.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
What the site can do, what opportunities are embedded in it.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
The technological ability of the site can be high, medium, or low.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:29.000
On the one hand, there are students of the second or third year in this industry who can make a site for their friends or not necessarily friends.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
This site will usually not be very creative and not very technological.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
It can cost two bottles of beer. But this is also a site.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
On the other hand, sites can be offered in this industry that are simultaneously super creative and super technological.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Such a site can cost 90 thousand euros.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
On this slide you see four strategic groups.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:07.000
There is a group of players in the gray industry, which offers super creative sites, but they are average in terms of technology.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000
There is a leader, a larger circle, and smaller players are rummaging around it.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
These are small gray circles.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.000
If you look at the orange group, this is a group of players who offer super technological sites.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
And the sites can do a lot, but the creativity of these sites can be quite average.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
There is also a large orange circle, and small players, whose sales volume is slightly smaller.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
But they also work in this strategic group.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
The upper right field is empty.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Not because no one knows how to make super creative and super technological sites.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
The demand for such sites is very small.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Sometimes orders are made, but they are rare.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
There is a group of students who can make a site for a bottle of beer or two.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
These are blue players.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
The lower left square.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.000
And, for example, there is a strategic group of players in green, who offer medium-sized sites in terms of technology and medium-sized sites in terms of creativity.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.000
It is impossible to say that orange players are direct competitors for blue or blue players.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
The price of the question is fundamentally different.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
A site for orange players or for gray players can cost several tens of thousands of euros.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
And a site for blue players can cost several tens of euros.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:56.000
And a very important point when we draw this table, this matrix, is the analysis of the so-called migration barriers.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
If a player works in a green strategic group, he is tired of it.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Or he is not interested in it.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Or he thinks that he will not earn much money in this strategic group.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
He wants to migrate to another strategic group.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:21.000
For example, he must overcome the so-called mobility or migration barriers in the orange or gray group.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
It can be new staff, new equipment, investment in marketing, and so on.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:37.000
But in order for a company from one strategic group to move to another, it has to move up, down, left, right along this matrix.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
And as a rule, you have to overcome the so-called mobility barriers.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
And this is a very important point.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000
We must understand what mobility barriers we will have to overcome if we want to move from one strategic group to another.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
The second example is the kitchen furniture industry.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.000
A company, analyzing its strategic groups, uses the price as one variable.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
How much does the kitchen cost?

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
The industry is divided into three parts.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
There are three layers.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
This is the economy class, the comfort class, and the premium class.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:23.000
The economy class is 1,500 euros for the kitchen.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
From 1,500 to 5,000 euros for the kitchen is the comfort class.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
And everything from 5,000 euros and above to infinity is the premium class.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
This is the vertical class.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
What can be done in the horizontal class?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000
In the horizontal class, you can try to analyze yourself and your competitors in terms of the quality of the furniture offered,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:55.000
in terms of its functionality, in terms of design, in terms of service support, in terms of manufacturing times.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.000
The next variable is whether we offer the kitchen to the client on credit or not.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Another variable that we discuss with our competitors is the number of salons.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Some have more salons, some have fewer.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And the last variable is the recognition.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
And this is what happens.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:31.000
If you use all these variables, you can make four matrices.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:42.000
A company called Capri is trying to understand its place in the industry.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
How is it with quality and functionality compared to competitors?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
How is it with terms and with the ability to sell on credit compared to the main competitors?

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
How does it look against the background of competitors in terms of furniture design and service support?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And how does it look compared to competitors in terms of design and the width of the company's network of salons?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:21.000
If we do it in the format of one page only, we get a fairly clear picture of our own position in the industry compared to our competitors.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
A very useful tool is the analysis of strategic groups.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:36.000
It is used when we analyze our own competitors and try to understand our own place in our industry.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000
When we analyze our competitors, we should ask ourselves the following questions.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the main players?

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
What does our competitors do better than us?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
What does our competitors do worse than us?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:06.000
As we look into the future, we should try to predict how the players in our industry will behave in the near future.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
What are their strategies? What will they do? What will they not do?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
And how will their behavior in the next two or three years affect the situation in the industry?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000
The third question we can ask ourselves is how great is the ability of players to negotiate with each other.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Can we be friends? Can we share our influence?

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.000
If we can, how high is the probability that our competitors will comply with the agreements and not violate them?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
This is how we try to understand our competitors.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
The second strength that Porter considers important is the power of the substitutes.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I repeat that these are players from other industries, but they are able to withdraw money from our industry.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
There are industries where there are not many substitutes, or there are none.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:10.000
But if a company produces glass, it is very difficult to say that there is a serious substitute.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:18.000
You can use plastic instead of glass, but there is no clear substitute for glass.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Or a website for a company.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.000
It is clear that no one had websites before, and companies were somehow similar, but now everyone has websites.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.000
It is unlikely that there is a clear substitute for a website.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
But there are industries where you have to make up with the actions of a large number of substitutes.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Remember the German brewery.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Or if your company works in the pharmaceutical market, offering a cold medicine to a client,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
it can face a problem.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:10.000
My good Czech friend says that the Czech Republic is traditionally saved from a cold with a beer in a pot.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
And they do not buy Fervex, Coldrex or other drugs.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Here is a substitute for you.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000
This is something from another industry that is able to withdraw money from ours.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
The third strength is the client.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:36.000
When we analyze clients, we try to understand how clients can trade with us at a price and payment.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
The first thing we have to do is segment the clients.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
We have to form more or less popular segments.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000
These are groups of clients that are similar in a certain set of characteristics.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
And then we have to assess the strength of each segment.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Because talking about clients in general is not about anything.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
It is too general, not specific and useless.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Therefore, the conclusion is that the number 0 stage is segmentation of clients for the subsequent analysis of each segment.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:26.000
This slide is an example of an attempt to segment the client market in the industry that produces and sells shoes.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
There are 8 criteria for segmentation.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Income level, floor, age, shoe size, geography of residence, city size, occupation type and attitude to fashion or style.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
These are the 8 criteria for segmentation.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:54.000
A company that produces shoes and has its own shoe store network considers important in its business.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Let's look at the income level.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
There is a group of clients that earn up to 300 euros per month.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
There is a group of clients that earn 300-500 euros per month.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Next, 500-700.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
The fourth group is in the range of 700-1000 euros per month.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Another segment is from 1000 to 2000.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And the last segment is clients that can earn from 2000 euros per month.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.000
So, in a large cell, we divided the income level of clients into 6 groups.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
I repeat, the shoe industry.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
The second criteria for segmentation is floor.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
It's simple.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
The third criteria is age.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
The company made its clients in 6 age categories.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Up to 16 years.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
16-21 years.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
21-30.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
30-45.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
45-60.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
And from 60 years.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
The sizes.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
The sizes of the shoes.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Up to 35.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
36-37.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
38-39.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
40-41.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
42-43.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
And 44 and above.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000
The company operates on 3 geographic markets.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Each market has its own nuances.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
There are nuances of the Ukrainian market, nuances of the Baltic market, nuances of the Russian market.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Let's recall PEST.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Politics, economy, social technology.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
All these 4 letters can be distinguished on these 3 markets.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Ukrainian, Baltic and Russian.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000
The company operates in different cities.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000
There are no stores yet, but there may be stores in cities with up to 20,000 inhabitants.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Again, there are no stores yet, but this is an interesting segment.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Cities with up to 20-50,000 inhabitants.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Next segment is 50-100,000 inhabitants.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
The next segment is 100-1,500.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
From 500,000 to a million-city is another segment.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
And the last segment is a city with a million-city and above.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:07.000
The type of occupation of the client is divided into a large number of groups.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
We see only 4 groups on this slide.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:23.000
For example, a student, an office manager of a middle level, an office manager of a high level, a head of a workshop, etc.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
The company makes its clients into 3 groups.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Interested, moderate and indifferent.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Let's look at 2 target segments.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Let's try to understand how the company should work with these segments.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.000
The next slide shows a grey segment.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000
This is a man who earns 2,000 euros.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
He is 55 years old.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000
He is 43 years old.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
He lives in Russia.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
The population of the city is 750,000.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
He works as a head of a workshop in one of the businesses.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
He has a rather indifferent attitude to fashion.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
This is his portrait.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000
This is a portrait of a second client.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
This is a woman who earns 620 euros per month.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
She is 24 years old.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
She is 37 years old.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
She lives in Ukraine, in a million-city, Kiev.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
She works as an office manager of a middle level.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
She has an attitude to fashion.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
These are 2 very different clients.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
If a company wants to work with grey and yellow,

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
it should understand the portrait of each client.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
It is very simple.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
The better we understand our client, the more we earn.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:09.000
If we can draw a portrait of our grey client in the smallest details,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
there is a high probability that we will earn a lot.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:22.000
If a company is oriented to the yellow and grey segments,

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
its entire chain of processes,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
from the design, to the purchase, to the production,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
to the branding, to the distribution, to the retail,

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000
can be very different.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
One chain of processes will be focused on the yellow segment,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
and the other chain of processes will be focused on the grey segment.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000
We should understand this very well.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
When we analyze our clients,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
the list of questions can be as follows.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
First of all, as we have already said,

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000
we try to assess the profitability of our target segments.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
How much the yellow or grey segments,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
or any other segment that interests us,

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000
can trade with us in terms of price and payment conditions,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000
and how it will be able to change in the near future.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
What is our current situation, and what will it be in 2-3 years?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
The second question is the volume of purchases.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
How much and how often does one segment buy,

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
and how much and how often does the other segment buy?

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000
It may be that your business has a segment that buys a little bit, but often,

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.000
or maybe you have a segment that buys a lot, but very rarely.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
The client's portrait changes.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
It is one now, tomorrow it will be another.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000
We should understand how the needs of the target segments,

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000
which we are focused on in our business, will change in the near future.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.000
The next factor, which can be very important in some industries,

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
is the cost of switching from one provider to another,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
and the level of loyalty.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
What do I mean by this?

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
If we are talking about household chemicals,

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
for example, washing powder,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000
then in this industry the cost of switching from one player to another is usually not very high.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Today I am using one washing powder,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
tomorrow I will not like it, I will switch it to another,

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
and it is not difficult for me.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
However, if we are talking about software for business,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
some IT solution,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
then switching from one provider to another is like a marriage-divorce process.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
It is quite difficult, painful and expensive.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
If the costs of switching from one provider to another are high,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
then the client's power will be higher.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Another factor that we can analyze,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000
is the share of costs of buying the product we offer in the cost structure.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
For example, if we offer the end product to the client,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
and the client is a metallurgical plant,

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.000
then the share of costs of buying the product will be low,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000
and the price sensitivity will be low.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:22.000
If we offer the end product to a metallurgical plant at a high price,

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
the client will not feel it,

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.000
because the share of the total purchases in the structure is negligible.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Another point that we should analyze,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000
is the possibility of integration forward or backward along the chain.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
What do I mean?

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Let's imagine an oil refinery,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
which can rewind the chain of its processes.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
What does it mean?

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:03.000
It means that it can try to put drilling towers in the oil production area,

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
or extend the chain forward,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000
or make its own network of gas stations.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
If we have the opportunity to extend the chain forward,

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
we are an oil refinery,

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000
and we can easily put our own gas stations,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000
then our position in negotiations on the price of the gas network is stronger.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Another factor is the seasonality.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
So, the conclusion is as follows.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:43.000
We segment our clients in order to understand the needs and behavior of each of the segments that interest us,

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000
and to work with each of them in different ways.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.000
It is obvious that the work of a company with a target segment of a woman of pre-retirement age,

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000
who works as a chief accountant of a large machine-building enterprise,

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000
and who values agility and comfort in shoes,

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
should work with one method, and with another target segment.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000
A young woman of 25 years,

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
who prefers brightness, style and uniqueness in shoes,

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
with this target segment of the company,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000
in all parts of the chain of its own processes,

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
should work differently.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:32.000
It is very important to understand how the portrait of your client will change in the near future,

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:42.000
and to be prepared for the fact that the chain of processes will have to be redone and sharpened to meet the needs of each segment.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
The second example on the same topic is from another industry,

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
the production of kitchen furniture.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
The company that we have already talked about,

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
divides its clients into four segments in terms of payment capabilities,

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
highlighting low incomes, medium, medium-high and high,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
as well as into four parts in terms of proven values.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
The example of this matrix, the example of segmentation of clients,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
is described in detail in this business in your materials.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Having discussed our clients,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and analyzed the target segments,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
and chosen the most interesting for ourselves,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
we should think about how to take these chests with money at the lowest possible costs for resources.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
In this case, we need to analyze the suppliers.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
It is very useful to imagine the reports of profits and losses,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
in which on the one hand there are incomes, and on the other there are expenses.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
When we analyze the clients, we try to find those interesting segments

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
from which we could take more money,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and sharpen our chain of processes accordingly.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
When we analyze our suppliers, we are talking about our expenses.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Here we should analyze all the articles of our costs.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It can be raw materials, it can be electricity, it can be equipment suppliers,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
it can be suppliers of square meters of heating and lighting,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
it can be suppliers of all kinds of services, transport, information, insurance, and so on.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It can be channels of communication with clients.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
If we decide that advertising time on TV is very expensive,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
we can try to reach out to the client via the Internet,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
or through external advertising, or some other means.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:55.000
A very important supplier is the staff that supplies us with their heads and hands,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
which we use in our business and for which we pay some money.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And, of course, a very important supplier is the supplier of capital.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It can be banks, it can be other structures that can give us money for development,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and the money is not free, it costs a certain percentage.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
One way or another, we have to go through the entire list of our expenses,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
evaluating the ability of suppliers to trade with us at the price and on the terms of payment.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
The main questions when analyzing suppliers are as follows.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
First of all, again, it is the ability to trade at the price and on the terms of payment.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
The second question is readiness for the stability of deliveries,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
both the quality parameters and the time parameters.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Is the supplier we work with able to provide us with the level of quality we would like to have

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and to supply our product or service that is stated in the contract?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:05.000
The third question we can ask ourselves is whether there are substitutes for the product that the supplier supplies us with.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
If there are, then the position of the supplier in negotiations changes, the power of the supplier decreases.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000
The same thing happens if we have an alternative for each type of resource,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
if we can turn to a large enough list of suppliers.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
For example, if we open the yellow page of the reference book,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and for each type of resource we need in our industry there are 384 tomato suppliers,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and all the tomato suppliers have the same number of suppliers,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
then the power of the tomato suppliers over us will be small.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000
In some industries, a fairly important factor may be the distance of the suppliers,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
as well as the ability to integrate back and forth.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
If our supplier can easily extend the chain forward,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000
become our direct competitor, then his position in negotiations is stronger.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And vice versa, if we can easily unwind the chain and tell the supplier

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that we are able to make the parts that you supply us,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
then it is very easy for us.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Accordingly, our position in negotiations becomes stronger.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
The second task that I recommend you to do is to analyze the factors of the environment,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000
try to understand your industry through the FiveForce model, the five forces of Michael Porter.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Everyone has competition, everyone has clients and suppliers,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and there are entry barriers in any industry.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Is there a substitute product factor in your business?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I don't know, because there are companies for which there is no problem with a substitute product,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
but there are industries where there are a lot of substitute products from other industries.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000
There is a point of view that Porter did not take into account all the factors in the industry within his FiveForce concept.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
For example, some experts suggest adding the sixth force of the state,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
but in principle, the state factor can be spread over all the five forces,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
because the state can be a competitor, a supplier, a client,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:23.000
an entry barrier, like a writer of some regulatory acts or a customs officer.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But in principle, we discussed the state factor when we were submitting the PEST analysis.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The letter P, the letter P, the legal issues, we discussed them.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But it seems to me that everything is quite consistent and logical in the FiveForce concept.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Please remember that you are not just listing factors,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000
you are again, as with the PEST analysis, trying to understand what this means for your business,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
what is included in the list of actions, what is included in the to-do list.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:04.000
If the client's demand increases and the clients will be divided into more or less homogeneous groups,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
each of which will have its own specific needs, requests, and so on,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
then you will most likely need to develop a certain service model for each target group,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:22.000
develop a standard, train the staff and control the implementation of this standard.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
This is a fairly specific action that we record in our strategy, analyzing our clients.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And please remember that if your business operates at the junction of industries,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
IT, marketing, business education, the recreation industry,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
you will have to do this work twice, do the analysis of the FiveForce for both industries,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:53.000
to take into account all the factors that you need to track when developing your strategy.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:06.000


01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:15.000
When we analyze our industry, we must work out a list of factors of success,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.000
which will consist of two parts, the basic and the strategic.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
What is the basic?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
These are the factors of success, the positions that all players in the industry have approximately the same.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:41.000
All these issues, the issues marked in black, are solved equally successfully, equally cheaply, equally quickly, equally efficiently.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:49.000
No one can say that this is my competitive advantage, I have it better, it is cheaper or it is faster.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
All players in the industry have the same positions.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:00.000
These are the issues that we must solve in order to get the right to play football.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:11.000
When we discuss strategic factors, we are talking about positions where one competitor may look a little better, and the other a little worse.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Someone gets it faster, someone slower, someone gets it more expensive, someone cheaper.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
For example, retail.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I will tell you a story from one of my acquaintances.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:40.000
In her student years, she worked in one of the retail stores, as a cashier.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000
A large player in the retail market in Germany.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
In the mid-90s, this player did not have a scanner at the cashier.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And since the positions in the assortment were limited, 800-900 positions in the assortment, this is not such a large list.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
One kind of cheese, one kind of beer, one kind of yogurt.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And the cashier at the cashier, in principle, remembers all the prices by heart.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Ideally, the cashier at the cashier should not look at the cash register, but should pull the units through the cash register at maximum speed and drum with his fingers on the keyboard, typing in the price.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So my acquaintance told me that if she saw a third person in line and saw what was in his basket, she already counted it in her head.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And the speed of her work with the product was so high that she pulled through her cash register much more units and much more buyers than the average cash register operator on their network and competing networks.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:02.000
It was a cashier crisis, a small competitive advantage that was taken from store to store, showing other cashiers how to work.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And she unloaded the queue at the peak hours at the cash registers.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:25.000
It can be considered a small competitive advantage, and in this scheme it will be highlighted in blue, because there is an employee on the cash register in all networks who pulls the product through the scanner or through the cash register at a certain speed.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:35.000
But if she does it faster than the rest, she can claim the status of a small competitive advantage, which we designate in this scheme in blue.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:47.000
In red, unique features of a company in a certain industry, which are only in its business model, which do not have competitors, are designated.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:11:06.000
In other words, the list of basic issues can be quite large. In highly competitive industries, 80% of what our company does, its competitors do it, and with about the same level of efficiency, equally cheap, equally fast, equally high quality.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:20.000
20% we leave for strategic factors, which can be highlighted in blue and red. Blue are the things that all competitors do, but not all of them do it equally well, equally fast or equally cheap.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And red positions are unique for a company that has A and does not have B and C.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:41.000
On this slide you see a list of basic and strategic factors of success of a company that produces kitchen furniture in the comfort class segment.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Remember, there are economy, comfort and premium. In this case, it is the comfort class. The company has analyzed its industry and eventually divided all the factors of success into two parts, the basic and the strategic.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:14.000
If we look at this matrix, we will see that all players in the industry already use approximately the same components, equally high quality. Everyone has more or less the same developed purchasing logistics.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Everyone has a delivery of furniture and its installation. And everyone has an Internet site. This is the so-called basic.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:49.000
The list of strategic factors is quite large at the moment. The achievements on this list are not the same for all players, so we consider them strategic. Let's see how functional the kitchen is.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:00.000
The second point on this list is the high-tech equipment that allows you to satisfy individual customer requests. Someone has such equipment, someone does not have such equipment yet.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:20.000
The third factor is the optimality of production processes. Someone's production in the industry is well-organized, there are few defects, shortcomings, and low waste. Accordingly, production costs are less. Someone's production is not so well-organized, and accordingly, costs are more.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:37.000
The deadlines. Someone manages to make the kitchen faster, someone has bad deadlines, and the company does not meet its promises on the deadlines for the client, and delays the production process and the order process.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:14:00.000
The number of salons where the kitchen is sold is also a strategic factor. Not all players in the industry are equally successful. The creativity of advertising on this list. There are players who have terribly creative advertising, memorable, and there are players who are not so good.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But the company does this analysis with an eye to the future, so in the second column we can see how the situation will change in the next 2-3 years. We see that some of the strategic sections are added to the basic ones that are on the list at the moment.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:49.000
The list of basic sections will change according to the company's forecasts. The functionality of the product, the availability of high-tech equipment, the availability of a good IT system. This is still in the strategic sections, but since the standards of competition are growing, in 2-3 years it will move to the category of basic. It will be equally successful, cheap, fast, and of equal quality for everyone.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And the companies in the industry will be discussing the following list among themselves. On the design of furniture, on the ability to make int-poshiv, on the strength of the brand, on the warranty terms after warranty service, on the speed of order execution, on the speed of innovation and new ideas, both in the field of technology and in the field of materials.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Another strategic factor is the range of networks in which furniture is sold, as well as the design of the showcase and what is inside the store. And, of course, such an important point as working with customers in the salons. The company's strategy will be built around this list in the near future.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:58.000
The rest of the questions are related to the category of basic. These questions should be solved by default. They are necessary, but not enough to win over competitors. This is the analysis of the factors of success. It should be done as a result of the analysis of the industry. I strongly recommend you do it.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I remind you that all analytical work before developing a strategy consists of two sections. This is a strategic analysis of the external environment and a strategic analysis of the company itself.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:29.000
We discussed two basic tools that are recommended to use when analyzing the external environment. The analysis of the far factors, PEST, and the analysis of the near factors is a five-force scheme, which is very well described in the works of Michael Porter.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:17:10.000
We now understand our external environment, we understand how it will change in the near future. The second work that we need to do is a strategic analysis of the company itself. What is good and what is not so good. And the second point is the so-called requirements of the owners, which can have a significant impact on our strategy.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:27.000
The analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the company, which is convenient to do in the format of the so-called value chain. The value chain is a term that Michael Porter also proposed.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:45.000
The idea is quite simple. A business can be imagined as a set of processes that create value for a target audience and processes that help these main processes create this value.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Porter calls the first category of processes primary processes, and the second category is secondary. Primary processes participate in the formation of value for a target audience, and secondary processes help the main processes create this value.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Let's imagine a conditional business, which is largely made up of six key processes. These are design, purchase, production, promotion, distribution, and service. All six processes can be called primary, because they are in a certain degree focused on creating value for a target audience.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The company also has auxiliary processes, which can be related to management of staff, management of finances, IT, general management. These are the things marked in yellow on this slide. They are usually through-the-way, helping the main processes create this value.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:08.000
It is very convenient for each process to draw a triangle of time and quality to analyze its state at the moment. Ideally, each process of our company should be fast, high-quality, and inexpensive.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:31.000
As in the old joke, in our restaurant, we can provide you with fast, inexpensive, and high-quality food, but you have to choose any of the three. Obviously, these triangles conflict with each other. As a rule, time conflicts with costs and quality. The faster, the more expensive, and probably the quality suffers.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:51.000
The higher the quality, the more expensive it is, and the longer it takes. If the costs are low, there is a chance that we will have fast and low-quality food. If we want fast and high-quality, there will probably be more costs. We try to catch the optimum in this triangle of time and quality.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Let's look at an example. The company produces kitchen furniture and, according to this scheme, analyzes its strengths and weaknesses. We see some of its chains, namely design, purchase, production, promotion, sales and service.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Most likely, there will be both advantages and disadvantages in each piece of the chain, and a brief list of the company's pros and cons.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:49.000
If we talk about their design, then, by and large, everything is good in this process. The company uses modern solutions for design, but, objectively assessing itself, says that it would be possible to implement innovations faster.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Customers want innovations, want something new, but the design team does not always do it quickly. Therefore, on a 10-point scale, 1 minimum, 10 maximum, we estimate this process at 7. A strong 7, but not more.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:28.000
The purchasing process. Everything is not bad in this process. The company uses high-quality components, the process is well-organized, we are friends with the suppliers.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:46.000
But there are disadvantages. In some positions, we depend heavily on the program of our suppliers. If a client comes to us and says, I want an orange countertop, we say that we only have blue, pink, yellow and lilac.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And the client says, I want an orange countertop. We have to call our suppliers and ask how quickly they can make the same orange countertop. Suppliers can say, sorry, guys, we have our schedule, we will release exclusively red in the next 3 months.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And such situations happen. The company tries to fight this, to actively manage this aspect, but it does not always work out. Therefore, we cannot give 10 points to this process at the moment, but we put a solid good 8.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:42.000
The production process is also set aside for 8 points out of a maximum of 10. Everything is very good there, good equipment, high-tech, capable of performing individual requests, very low marriage level, very low waste level, very few in-production delays, set-aside production processes.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:23:06.000
But there are a number of disadvantages. This is not a very high speed of order execution. Basically, this is due to the fact that limited production capacities do not allow our company to cope with the flow of orders that may be at the moment. And all this together, we add up and put a solid 8 to our production process.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:26.000
We move on to promotion. Here, as we can see, everything is very bad, the score is very low, we have not found any advantages in this process, only one is a complete disadvantage. The main one is that our advertising policy is very uncreative and our advertising is extremely unrecognizable.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:50.000
This is our competitive advantage, not our competitive disadvantage. Therefore, we cannot give more than 4 points to our promotion process on a 10-point scale. The sales process is set aside for 8 points. We have a well-developed network, we have a lot of our salons, well-made, well-designed.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:06.000
The salons are regularly washed, the showcase works perfectly, but in the regions this network is not very large, we would like to have a larger, wider household network in the regions, so we put 8 points in total to this process at the moment.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:30.000
As for the service process, the process is also well-developed, we have a longer warranty period than most competitors, and our installers, unlike the installers of our competitors, work very well. They come at the time when they were promised, they install the kitchen with the doors closed, this is the main position of the company.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:56.000
It is undesirable for the client to see how the sausage is made and it is undesirable for the client to see how the kitchen is installed. When the kitchen is already installed, everything is ready, everything is sparkling, everything is shining, we invite the client, he enters the kitchen, he has the first emotion like this. And this is a very important emotion, because he remains loyal, he recommends us to his friends, and so on.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Well, a small competitive advantage of our company is that our installers, unlike the installers of our competitors, do not smell and do not have bruises under their eyes. Competitors have a problem with this, if our client orders a competitor's kitchen, two rather gloomy subjects will come to him, one with a bruise under the left eye, the other under the right eye, they will come with a delay, they will install with a large number of problems, and after that they will leave dirt and garbage behind.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:49.000
We have everything in this process, not bad, 8 points, he deserves maybe even 9, but so as not to relax, we will put 8. If you look at the entire chain, you will see that the company has a lot of advantages, these processes are marked in green, there are outright failures, as with promotion, this is a weak point, a weak side of the company.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:26:08.000
But there are processes, let's say, average, we evaluated the design process for 7, highlighted it in yellow, according to the principle of a traffic light, stating that it cannot be included in the list of strong and weak, it will be something average.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Here is an example of the analysis of weak and strong sides, but there is another nuance. An important point to remember when analyzing weak and strong sides is that some conditional weak sides can be an integral attribute of your business model, and you deliberately made them like this.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:53.000
For example, visitors to discount stores located outside the ring city can complain that it is far to go there, that there is a very small assortment in discounters, and that there can be quite long queues at the cash registers in the evenings.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:05.000
But these features are an integral attribute of the business model of discounters, and only one side of the coin, the other side of the coin is usually very low prices.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:22.000
We cannot criticize a hacksaw for the fact that it is difficult to hammer nails or a hammer for the fact that it is difficult to cut a tree into pieces. These are the aspects we must remember when we analyze weak and strong sides of our company.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:40.000
The next point is the requirements of the owners, which we often have to take into account before developing a strategy. In general, they can be divided into two parts, these are the financial requirements of the owners and the so-called non-financial ones.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:28:07.000
As for the financial requirements, usually all owners want money and set a certain target value of the profitability coefficient for the invested capital. On the slide you see the abbreviation ROE, Return on Equity, a very simple formula, the profit factor that our business earns over a period in the denominator of the capital invested by the owners.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:28.000
This is the amount of capital of the company without loans, without borrowed funds, how effectively the dollars, euros, rubles invested by the owners work in the company. They can set a target value that is usually associated with risks.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:54.000
At the same time, we must understand that the value of this minimum profitability of the invested capital can be different within the same company. Imagine that there is a business consisting of four business units that operates on the spare parts market. The company has two business units that sell spare parts on the market A and two business units that sell spare parts on the market B.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:18.000
At the same time, one business unit on each market sells spare parts, and the other one sells spare parts for trucks. The minimum profitability value for the capital that reflects the risks of running a business is 21%, 23% in the first business unit, 25% in the third, and 29% in the fourth business unit.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:41.000
This is the minimum profitability of the invested capital, the minimum greed of the shareholder. Why is it different? Because the risks are different. The risks can be external and internal. For example, in one market, two business units receive capital at 21-23%, and in another market at 27-29%.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:30:06.000
The market risks are different. In one market, the risks are slightly higher, in another market, the risks are slightly lower, so the value of this bet can change. In addition, the risks can be internal. In the market A, the shareholder sets a percentage bet of 21-23%, says that everything is under his control, a professional team of managers, I trust them completely, and therefore they receive capital cheaper.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And in another market, not only external risks are higher, but also the team of managers is not very professional, I am constantly stressed with some questions, I constantly advise what bulbs to buy for the warehouse, and something like that, so the capital will be more expensive for them. The minimum profitability value is 27-29%.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Another financial requirement is the size of the business. For example, a company works in the ceramic tile market, a network of salons in which beautiful Italian tiles are sold. The owner of this network, who has three points, says, I do not want to grow, I am satisfied with such a small family business consisting of three salons.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I do not want to be a big company, because a big company is managed differently, it is 37 hours of work day, and so on, and so on, and so on. I do not want to grow. Another owner in the same industry says, and I want to grow, I want to be a big company, have a large share of the market, and I need a lot of salons, I want a company with a high turnover.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:41.000
The third financial requirement that owners can often voice is the ratio of their own and borrowed capital. Let's go back to the company that sells spare parts. Until recently, the company worked on its own, and the capital structure consisted of a very large percentage of its own capital, under 80%, and the remaining 20% is a creditor's debt.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:32:08.000
In the bank, the company did not ask for money, because, in principle, it lacked its own, plus creditors. But the company thinks about making some projects on the real estate market, that is, not just to trade spare parts, but to build several large malls, such shopping centers, in which some number of square meters will be used for the sale of spare parts,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:32.000
and some number of square meters will be given to the STO, to an inexpensive hotel, to a general food point. In general, the company is interested in the real estate market, and all free money is directed to this area, and business units that trade spare parts are now forced to go to banks and take money there for further development.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:50.000
The owner says that there will be no more debt, and look for money in banks, earn a credit history, increase the share of borrowed capital. In principle, in the interests of the owner, these business units should take money from banks, and not demand debt.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But at the same time, it can denote a certain minimum value of their own capital, which should be in their balance structure, because if this value of their own capital is too small, then risks become very serious for the owner.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:29.000
In principle, the general world practice says that the share of your own capital should hardly be less than 10-15%, and then it is too risky, and it should hardly be more than 80%, because your own capital is quite expensive, and in the interests of managers, it is better to take less expensive money from suppliers or banks.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:57.000
In addition to financial requirements, the owners can issue so-called non-financial requirements. For example, the head of the company IKEA, Ingor Kamprad, said in an interview with a journalist that IKEA will no longer be a public company, it will remain a family enterprise, and this is his main position, and he explains it as follows.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Back in the mid-1980s, he had a meeting with the leaders of the Soviet Union, and the highest officials promised him that IKEA would not experience any problems in the Soviet market.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:30.000
The officials said that the assistant was giving good, and that they could put a million-dollar store in each city, and that they would be grateful to them.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And IKEA began to enter this market in the mid-1980s, and in 2006, as far as I know, it earned its first euro profits, it was making profits for about 20 years.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:35:04.000
If IKEA were a public company, Kamprad says, the shareholders would say, Ingor, what 20 years? We want a profit, well, a maximum of two years. And this is a common thing in a public company, that is why Kamprad wants IKEA to be non-public.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Non-financial demands may concern the image of the company. The company Benetton has no doubt about advertising, the company believes that it is normal to challenge society, to apotheosis society, and not everyone agrees with them,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:37.000
but the management and owners of the company believe that this is normal, this is good, this is acceptable, and if the hiring management does not like it, the hiring management can most likely find another place to work.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Non-financial demands may concern the product portfolio. Howard Schulz, the creator of Starbucks, writes in his book, this is the American coffee network, that initially he wanted to build a business very similar to Italian coffee shops,

01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:09.000
but in a boutique type of establishment, where a very professional bartender can hear the customers who ate borsch and crab salad for lunch today and ask the bartender what kind of coffee to drink, taking into account that I had borsch and crab salad for lunch.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And the bartender had to tell him that in your situation I recommend mixing an interesting mixture, 40% of this coffee grown in Sumatra, 40% of this coffee grown in Kenya, and 20% of the remaining coffee from Jamaica. If you fry this mixture and cook it, then at the end you will get a drink that smells a little like raspberries.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:57.000
This will be the best for you, taking into account that you had borsch and crab salad. This is what Starbucks was thinking. Now we see a completely different business model, because when they started to grow, it seems that in California they were asked to offer not just classic Italian cappuccino, which is made with quite fatty milk, but in California they were asked to offer cappuccino with fat-free milk.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And Howard Schultz had to break his values, what is called through the knee, including such a cappuccino in his product portfolio. He did not want to, but the customers demanded it. In some other American city, customers demanded that he include a sandwich with sausage in the assortment. This also contradicted the original idea of ​​Italian coffee.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:39.000
As a rule, in Italy, in coffee shops, they do not eat sandwiches with sausage, but if the customers want. The manager of another company can say, dear manager, I want our company to be innovative, and we are engaged in exclusively innovative projects. Not innovative, not interesting, I do not want our company to be engaged.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:38:04.000
There may be some non-financial requirements in the field of personnel policy, there may be requirements, let's say, on basic values. In one company I read, in the inter-company constitution it was written in very large letters, we do not give discounts. This is the principal position of the owners, and they should not explain why. The company should not give discounts, consider that they have such cockroaches in their heads.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Or charity. One Italian company works in the ceramic tile market. Of course, it has some financial results, but the owner of the company, the most important thing, when he is at home, talking to his neighbors, he shows them a hedgehog.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:56.000
A hedgehog is such an earth ball, a globe, pierced with needles. Each needle means a place where you can look, and if you want, buy a tile of this Italian company. Not all points work profitably, but the owner of the company can say that the tile of his company is known, not necessarily bought. And in the northeast of Bolivia, and so on.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:17.000
There is a very high probability that some points will never make a profit, and there is a very high probability that the opening of these profit-loss points will contribute to sales in other places. Most likely, there is no connection, but this is a kind of non-financial requirement of the owner, and he is interested.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:28.000
So think about what financial and non-financial requirements of your owners can affect the strategy of your business, and be sure to take this into account when developing a strategy.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:50.000
So, here is our main scheme again. Analysis of the external environment, analysis of internal factors. We discussed what the PEST factors are and what the five forces of the industry are. We talked about what the analysis of the weak and strong sides is and outlined the significance of the last such moment, the requirements of the owners.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:40:12.000
The next task is to analyze the strong and weak sides of your company. I recommend that you depict your business as a combination of key business processes. It seems to me that there should be 10-15 of them, as a rule, so as not to get lost in the depths. But at the same time, 10-15 provide an acceptable degree of detail.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:33.000
So, you represent a business as a chain of processes. Some of them create value for the client, some of them help to create this value. You draw a triangle of costs and quality time for each process. Ideally, the 10-point process is inexpensive, high-quality and fast, or temporary.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:53.000
The process that we set to 1 or 2 on a 10-point scale is bad in all three corners. It is expensive, it requires a lot of resources, it is slow or not timely, and it is not very high-quality. But you must understand the achievements and problems that exist at the moment, digest it all and set a score.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:14.000
The score is well remembered, you can use the principle of a traffic light, red, yellow, green. And those processes that are set to paint in green, those processes that have a lot of problems with buy-outs, we draw in red. And such average processes can be yellow.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Another task is to analyze the requirements of the owners. We remember that they can affect the strategy of the company quite seriously. And, in principle, they consist of two sections – financial and non-financial.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Financial is, as a rule, a requirement for the level of profitability for the capital itself and for the share of the capital in the overall structure. Non-financial can be called cockroaches, but they have to be taken into account when developing a strategy.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:01.000
They can be related to the product portfolio, personnel policy, sphere of activity, and, in principle, anything. They need to be understood, they need to be recorded, they need to be taken into account.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Igor Armitiev, co-founder and chief company officer of Svetlana Erasateeva, resource manager, Krasnaya 就是azeri.net

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Another analysis is a summary analysis, known as SWOT analysis, weak and strong sides, possibilities and threats.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000
It is done based on the results already obtained.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:44.000
We see that PEST analysis, analysis of five forces, analysis of weak and strong sides are included in this SWOT analysis.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Let's see how it is done.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
The general scheme is shown on the slide.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Four fields.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
In one field we briefly list our key and strong sides of the business.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
In another field we talk about our disadvantages, our problems, which we have at the moment.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
In general, weak sides.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Again, briefly, the most key points.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Two more fields are intended for listing opportunities or chances and threats or risks.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:30.000
There is an opinion, in my opinion, it is not quite correct, that the possibilities and threats are only some external phenomena from the external environment, from PEST or from five forces.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It's not quite like that.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:39.000
My friends in Munich, the Controller Academy, were created back in 1971.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Albrecht Dail, their founding father, in his best years, gathered 120-150 people for author seminars.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
They paid very good money and there was a fairly large list of expectations.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I remember those times from nostalgia, because those were very good times.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
It was the same as having a license to print money.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000
But somewhere in the late 90s Dail began to hold less author seminars.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And in 2002, it seems, he was going to retire.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:25.000
He raised a number of so-called apostles, his followers, his supporters, who continue to develop his ideas.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
But they did not give.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Dail is the founding father, he gathered a large number of people for author seminars.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:47.000
And the managers, conducting a photo analysis, say that there is a very high probability that sales will drop if our founding father retires.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:58.000
The same way as the managers of the Manchester United football club can conduct a photo analysis and say that if Cristiano Ronaldo goes to Real,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:05.000
the stadium will not be filled 100%, because a lot of people go to Cristiano Ronaldo.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:11.000
So there can be threats and opportunities both from the outside and from the inside.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:21.000
What we did at the stage of the PEST analysis and the analysis of the five forces, it is connected here, these two large arrows below.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:26.000
But the arrows on the side, on the right and on the left, these light yellow ones, are some things from the inside,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:34.000
which may well be here, remember the situation with Albert Dail, who was going to retire at the Controller Academy.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
An example of a photo analysis in front of you.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
This is a business that produces kitchen furniture.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:50.000
In the yellow fields we see a list of the key strengths and weaknesses, as well as a list of key opportunities and threats.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Let's see. The company, among its strengths, has a high quality of products.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:05.000
The product itself is cool, polished, there is little defect, the client likes it, it serves for a long time, there are constant compliments.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:16.000
The company says that our strong point is the availability of good equipment, high-tech, flexible, which allows us to meet individual requests of our clients.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:25.000
We currently have a very well-developed SBT network in the capital, and this is definitely our competitive advantage, our strong point.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:36.000
The installation process is well-organized, the installers are polite, correct, professional, and they have a small feature,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:44.000
when the installation of the kitchen is carried out, they invite the hostess home, show her the newly installed cool kitchen,

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:56.000
and give the hostess a beautiful rose, unexpected, and this affects the loyalty of the clients much more than all the outdoor advertising on the Leningrad Prospect.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
This is a small feature, in principle, can be attributed to the list of strong points.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Weaknesses. The company, in principle, cannot boast of the brand's fame.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It cannot say that the brand is loud and that the company is very recognizable.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
This is not the case at the moment, unfortunately.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000
There is no developed network in the regions yet, and this is a weak point.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Technical innovations, innovations in materials are introduced quite slowly.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
We have already said that the dependence on the main suppliers is quite high.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
These four positions can be considered a list of weaknesses.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:47.000
As for the opportunities, the welfare of the target segment is growing, and the culture of consumption is changing.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:57.000
The company would like to train its clients to be Italian, and the clients react to this easily, agree to behave like Italians when buying,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.000
and the company is grateful to them for this and says that this is a positive fact.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000
In the market, credit resources are becoming more and more accessible,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:14.000
and the company can use relatively inexpensive money to open corporate salons in the regions

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
and to credit its clients when buying a kitchen.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:25.000
The company also considers the development of IT and the Internet as a chance, as a very interesting opportunity.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
However, there are a number of problems, potential threats or risks.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
The risk is the escalation of competition, the growth of value resources,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:45.000
the increase of attention from the state to business, and the potential decline in the economy.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:56.000
In principle, this is a classic SWOT analysis, when we briefly summarized our achievements and problems on one page,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
and also identified the key opportunities and risks.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:10.000
When we did SWOT analysis, a very useful addition to it is a cross-analysis within this SWOT analysis,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:22.000
when we try to establish connections between the strong sides of our company and the existing opportunities and risks in these four fields,

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:30.000
as well as discuss how our weak sides are connected with existing opportunities and risks.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:40.000
In this field, we ask ourselves how we can use our strong sides to take advantage of the opportunities that are open to us.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Or what opportunities, especially in the external environment, can make our strong sides even stronger.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Moving on to this field, we ask ourselves how we can fight the threats that we have to take into account in our business

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.000
due to our strong sides.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.000
The second question we should ask ourselves is how threats and risks,

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:20.000
especially from the external environment, can weaken our strong sides, destroy them.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Moving on to this field, we ask ourselves what opportunities we can use to eliminate our weak sides,

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
which we should eliminate.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
The second question is very important.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.000
What disadvantages can prevent us from using the opportunities that are open to us?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:51.000
And the last question, in the worst case scenario, on the cross-section of weak sides and threats,

01:50:51.000 --> 01:51:00.000
is what disadvantages can prevent us from confronting the threats that we have.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:08.000
The second question is whether external threats can further aggravate our weak sides.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:18.000
This is a so-called cross-analysis that we do on the cross-section of these fields.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000
The results of this cross-analysis can be seen on the slide.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Each of the four squares has some ideas that can be taken and recorded in the business strategy right now.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:39.000
So, let's go back to this slide, looking at which we are thinking about how to live on.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:47.000
The distributor of household chemicals and cosmetics asks itself what's next, production, logistics or retail?

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:53.000
The company that produces lasers remains in this industry, remains a laser manufacturer,

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
but it can also develop in three ways.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Operational improvement, polishing the production and purchasing processes.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Innovative product leadership, investing in New Yorker, strengthening the brand, supplementing it with services.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:15.000
The client is polished, not offering any innovative solutions, but making a customized product,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
as much as possible tailored to the needs of each specific client.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.000
But, of course, you also need to work well in the service sector.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
These are three different ways.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:31.000
And the first and second companies choose their own way, strategic analysis helps,

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:37.000
which, I will remind you again, consists of the following four tasks.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
This is the analysis of the factors of the long-term environment in the external environment, PEST,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
the policy of the economy and social technology.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Analysis of the factors of the near-term environment in the industry.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000
This is the competition of the supplier, client, suppliers and the fifth force, the entry barriers.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.000
When analyzing the company, we look at its strong sides and its weak sides,

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
and also study the requirements of the owners.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:10.000
After analyzing all these issues, we can think about alternatives and, in the end,

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000
choose our strategy, choose our general line of the party.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
The next task is the final SWOT analysis.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:25.000
It is a summary of all previous analytical work.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:33.000
We have to put it into the format of one page, which we divide into four parts,

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000
rewrite the key strong and weak sides,

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
denote the key threats,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:48.000
and then try to establish the connections between the strong sides of the threat,

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
as well as the weak sides of the threat.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:58.000
After that, we have a complete picture of the state of our business at the moment,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:03.000
what are its prospects, what are the chances it has to be considered,

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
and what are the threats to the internal environment, as well as to the internal one.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:17.000
This is the necessary base on which we develop our strategy for the near future.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.000
The final SWOT analysis

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:34.000
The key organizational aspects

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000
The key organizational aspects

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000
In conclusion, I would like to focus on the key organizational aspects,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
which are important to remember when conducting a strategic analysis.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.000
My experience allows me to say that it is very good

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
if a small initiative group of three or four people is formed,

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:07.000
which will prepare a draft for discussion in a more extensive composition.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000
This small initiative group should consist of three or four people

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
who work in different structural divisions.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
This includes marketing, production, logistics, and finance.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.000
People from different divisions of the company will complement each other,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:30.000
and after some work, they will be able to make a basic version for discussion.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
This basic version is then discussed in an extensive composition at a meeting,

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000
where 15-20 people can be invited.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000
They will listen to the members of the initiative group,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.000
study this basic version, and start discussing, correcting, and supplementing it.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
This is much more effective than gathering and discussing an empty sheet of paper.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
If there was no such preliminary draft version,

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.000
a lot of time will go to preparing some raw information,

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000
which must then be structured, organized, and presented in a normal way.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000
It is much more effective to make a basic version before the meeting,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
and then discuss it in a wide circle.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Everything that is discussed at this meeting is recommended to be recorded

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.000
in e- or paper form, because very good thoughts are sometimes forgotten.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.000
If they are put on paper, there is a chance that they will be realized.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I think that the exit format is necessary.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.000
It is very difficult to disconnect from your routine in the office,

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
it is very difficult to disconnect your mobile phone in the office.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
But if you go to the forest, breathe fresh air,

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
open your chakras, this process will be much more effective.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I think that you should do this twice a year.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I recommend going to a dental doctor twice a year.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I think that strategic tests should also be taken twice a year,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
because everything changes quickly in every industry,

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
competition changes, clients change.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.000
If you do not do this often enough, there is a chance that you will not have time.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Dear colleagues, I am sure that in addition to using your business,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
you are conducting strategic tests,

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
you will enjoy the tests.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I hope that the thoughts that you saw in these slides

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
will be useful for your business.
