00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Naturally, since the main task for the rotor is behavior prediction,

00:06.500 --> 00:15.500
the rotor, based on the requirements of the natural scientific description,

00:15.500 --> 00:22.000
offers a formula that allows this behavior prediction to be built.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.500
So, from the point of view of the rotor, behavior prediction is a potential.

00:26.500 --> 00:31.500
The desire and the requirements that I set for myself.

00:31.500 --> 00:37.500
And this potential of behavior is made up of expectations,

00:37.500 --> 00:42.000
again, I set for myself, and those values and reinforcements that I have

00:42.000 --> 00:46.500
from the point of view and with respect to social values.

00:46.500 --> 00:52.500
If I know, measure, represent the expectations of a person,

00:52.500 --> 00:58.500
if I know his attitude, his assessment, his representation,

00:58.500 --> 01:06.500
the values chosen by him, then I can assess the potential that he can achieve.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.500
Again, the idea is very simple.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.500
Let's take a careerist.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.500
At the moment when he is busy to achieve promotion,

01:16.500 --> 01:21.500
he works overtime, he re-executes plans.

01:21.500 --> 01:32.500
He is active, but he does it not to increase the company's performance,

01:32.500 --> 01:34.500
not to take care of the company.

01:34.500 --> 01:38.500
He has only one value, to be promoted.

01:38.500 --> 01:43.500
His expectations are connected with his promotion.

01:43.500 --> 01:48.500
If these expectations coincide with the value of the reinforcement,

01:48.500 --> 01:52.500
then he gets a promotion, and here is the potential.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.500
We can predict that he has achieved his goal.

01:55.500 --> 02:01.500
If there is a discrepancy in expectations and values,

02:01.500 --> 02:04.500
then the total amount may be insufficient,

02:04.500 --> 02:09.500
and, in the end, the attitude to you as a careerist

02:09.500 --> 02:16.500
may be the reason for not promoting you to the management position.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.500
You have already quarreled with the team,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.500
so you will scold everyone if you are still in power.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
Here is the potential of his behavior.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.500
And, knowing the expectations, values and reinforcement,

02:28.500 --> 02:30.500
I can make predictions.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
It is not necessary that my prediction will be fulfilled.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.500
Will it be fulfilled or not,

02:35.500 --> 02:38.500
I will see it in my experience and practice.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.500
If it will not be fulfilled, then I made a mistake somewhere.

02:41.500 --> 02:46.500
I am given a formula that can serve as a prognostic interest.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.500
This is what concerns the theory of social learning of Rotor.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.500
But Rotor is not a data-driven company.

02:53.500 --> 02:58.500
The advantage of biheorists is that they are operational.

02:58.500 --> 03:03.500
They do not build theories that can be tested,

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
argued and written in dissertations.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.500
They build an experiment that can be carried out

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
and it will give an answer whether you are right or not.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
If we talk about social prognosis,

03:15.500 --> 03:24.500
then, of course, there are some motives that move a person towards a goal.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.500
There are some motives that he wants to satisfy.

03:27.500 --> 03:33.500
In this case, Rotor introduces the concept of necessity.

03:33.500 --> 03:38.500
It has long been seen in psychology, but not in biheorism.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
Biheorists did not need necessity,

03:40.500 --> 03:43.500
because necessity was in the inner characteristics.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.500
This is for cognitivists, this is for general psychologists.

03:46.500 --> 03:51.500
Rotor introduces a biheoristic, a biheral understanding of necessity.

03:51.500 --> 03:58.500
Necessity as specific goals that I need to achieve.

03:58.500 --> 04:03.500
These are the same expectations that I strive for from the previous formula.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.500
But again, it is not enough to introduce.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.500
We need to give a way to measure these needs,

04:10.500 --> 04:15.500
understood as specific goals that I strive for.

04:15.500 --> 04:22.500
Rotor solves this problem by introducing six main criteria

04:22.500 --> 04:25.500
that characterize human needs.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.500
Moreover, these criteria characterize these needs

04:29.500 --> 04:32.500
from the point of view of a person's behavior prognosis.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.500
For Rotor, the main task is prognosis.

04:35.500 --> 04:40.500
What a person will do, how he will behave.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.500
But in order to answer the question, how,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.500
I need to know why and what points he does.

04:46.500 --> 04:53.500
As for these categories, the first category is the status of recognition.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.500
A person is a social being.

04:56.500 --> 05:02.500
If I try to achieve a certain position, a certain social niche,

05:02.500 --> 05:09.500
it is determined by the social hierarchy that is created by the society.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.500
This is the social recognition theory of Rotor.

05:12.500 --> 05:17.500
Accordingly, this niche has a certain status.

05:17.500 --> 05:23.500
One thing is to be a janitor, another thing is to be a president.

05:23.500 --> 05:28.500
The third thing is to be a general director.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.500
The fourth thing is to be a project manager, and so on.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.500
There are certain statuses.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.500
Depending on what status you are,

05:37.500 --> 05:40.500
depending on what status you strive for,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
it depends on your expectations.

05:42.500 --> 05:47.500
You can strive to be the senior assistant of the second junior janitor.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
This is your status.

05:49.500 --> 05:56.500
This is the level of achievements that you have set for yourself.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
This is your reputation.

05:58.500 --> 06:09.500
The status of a teacher, doctor, lawyer, economist, teacher, businessman is different.

06:09.500 --> 06:17.500
Every social role has its own social status.

06:17.500 --> 06:23.500
When you choose a certain role, you set a bar for yourself.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.500
A bar is the level of your expectations.

06:26.500 --> 06:32.500
The higher the status of recognition, the higher the level of your expectations.

06:32.500 --> 06:40.500
But, naturally, we live in a social world, as Rotor claims.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.500
Unfortunately, not everything depends on me.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
Yes, a person has an activity.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.500
Rotor does not argue with Bandura.

06:49.500 --> 06:53.500
Rotor and Bandura are representatives of the cognitive-behavioral direction,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.500
and a person is active for them.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
Here they are divided into radical behaviorism.

06:57.500 --> 07:05.500
But the problem is that a person understands

07:05.500 --> 07:12.500
that other people claim the same niche in the social ladder.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
There are many of them.

07:14.500 --> 07:20.500
Consequently, there is a certain struggle,

07:20.500 --> 07:24.500
the outcome of which is not clear.

07:24.500 --> 07:29.500
Therefore, you need to have some protection.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
Protection for yourself,

07:31.500 --> 07:37.500
because not everyone will be able to become a janitor, if desired.

07:37.500 --> 07:43.500
In this regard, I must have some protection for my inner variables,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
for my activity,

07:45.500 --> 07:51.500
which will allow me to maintain my self-esteem

07:51.500 --> 07:55.500
in case of not achieving the desired status.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.500
To maintain the very effectiveness that Bandura talks about.

07:59.500 --> 08:04.500
Rotor understands perfectly well that if a person's self-esteem drops,

08:04.500 --> 08:10.500
his inner variables are under threat,

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
and they begin to depend on external stimuli.

08:13.500 --> 08:19.500
We move from the new formula of stimulus of the inner variable reaction

08:19.500 --> 08:21.500
to the old one, stimulus of the reaction.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.500
Inner variables are devalued.

08:23.500 --> 08:28.500
Why should I deal with them if I still can't achieve anything?

08:28.500 --> 08:32.500
A person again becomes dependent on the external world.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
From the point of view of the rotor,

08:34.500 --> 08:40.500
a person must find his place in this world

08:40.500 --> 08:44.500
depending on the conditions that surround him.

08:44.500 --> 08:50.500
In this regard, the next category that he highlights is the category of domination.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.500
People have different expectations.

08:53.500 --> 08:58.500
Someone wants to rise to have power.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.500
It doesn't matter why, it doesn't matter why.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.500
I have an expectation that I must be above someone,

09:05.500 --> 09:08.500
that is, someone must be in my power.

09:08.500 --> 09:15.500
If I can't dominate, then I am in someone's power.

09:15.500 --> 09:20.500
And, accordingly, the level of my pressures falls.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.500
I begin to justify myself.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
Why do I need extra responsibility?

09:25.500 --> 09:27.500
Why do I need headaches and so on?

09:27.500 --> 09:30.500
I think this is more than justified to maintain one's self-esteem.

09:30.500 --> 09:37.500
Therefore, domination is an important criterion that determines the power of a person's activity.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.500
Strong domination, I will go on headaches.

09:40.500 --> 09:45.500
Weak domination, they wouldn't touch me.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500
The rules of the tram.

09:47.500 --> 09:52.500
The fourth indicator is independence.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.500
Naturally, all these indicators are interconnected.

09:55.500 --> 10:02.500
The schemes proposed by Skinner, Bandura, Rotter,

10:02.500 --> 10:07.500
are autonomous indicators that exist independently of each other.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.500
All these indicators are interconnected.

10:10.500 --> 10:14.500
This is a system, which is very good, which is very important in Bichiarism.

10:14.500 --> 10:18.500
They create autonomy, they create a system of parameters.

10:18.500 --> 10:24.500
And this is the criterion that is included in the methodology of Bichiarism.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
Independence.

10:26.500 --> 10:35.500
Am I ready to take responsibility for my reaction, for my behavior,

10:35.500 --> 10:42.500
for processing my internal variables of these external requirements?

10:42.500 --> 10:47.500
The manager works in the company, he receives the task,

10:47.500 --> 10:53.500
and then he, at his own risk, comes up with different ways to solve it.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.500
He can solve everything and get a promotion, a bonus, a promotion.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.500
He may not take something into account, not fulfill the plan,

11:02.500 --> 11:05.500
receive a fine, dismissal, punishment.

11:05.500 --> 11:12.500
So, independence is, in fact, the degree of responsibility.

11:12.500 --> 11:16.500
How much responsibility can I take?

11:16.500 --> 11:19.500
The more domination, the more responsibility I am ready to take.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.500
The more responsibility I take, the higher the status I claim.

11:23.500 --> 11:29.500
The more responsibility I take, the more dependent I am on circumstances,

11:29.500 --> 11:33.500
because I am responsible for too many points.

11:33.500 --> 11:44.500
The next criterion is, again, for Bichiarism, an unacceptable one.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
Love and attachment.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
How can you measure love and attachment?

11:49.500 --> 11:52.500
The situation is very simple.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.500
How many people love you?

11:55.500 --> 11:58.500
How many people do you love?

11:58.500 --> 12:04.500
Love is understood here as a measure of trust.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.500
How many people can rely on you?

12:07.500 --> 12:10.500
How many people can rely on you?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
Love and attachment.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.500
In fact, in this case, we are talking about friends,

12:16.500 --> 12:21.500
about those with whom you have a cooperative relationship,

12:21.500 --> 12:24.500
where the relationship is not a one-on-one,

12:24.500 --> 12:26.500
but a relationship where there is a problem,

12:26.500 --> 12:29.500
I will help you solve it, and I will not take anything from you now.

12:29.500 --> 12:34.500
At the same time, I know that if I have difficulties, you will help me.

12:34.500 --> 12:38.500
For Bichiarism, this is a completely subjective indicator.

12:38.500 --> 12:42.500
But Rotor again introduces love and attachment,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.500
albeit in such a formalized form,

12:44.500 --> 12:48.500
but it is trying to describe a living, functioning,

12:48.500 --> 12:53.500
everyday person existing in the world around us.

12:53.500 --> 13:00.500
And perhaps the most indisputable criterion,

13:00.500 --> 13:03.500
but at the same time difficult to measure, is physical comfort.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
We all strive for physical comfort,

13:05.500 --> 13:08.500
but for some people comfort is a dacha in Hawaii,

13:08.500 --> 13:12.500
for others comfort is to get into a corner and just sleep.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.500
For some people comfort is to be brought to the plane,

13:16.500 --> 13:19.500
for another person to fly,

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
for others comfort is to be left alone,

13:21.500 --> 13:25.500
so that you can relax on the computer.

13:25.500 --> 13:32.500
In this case, physical comfort is measured from the point of view of a person's satisfaction.

13:33.500 --> 13:38.500
Physical, material, tangible stimuli that you have.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.500
And in this regard, this is a Bichiarist approach,

13:41.500 --> 13:48.500
because it is determined by your expectations, your goals,

13:48.500 --> 13:56.500
your independence, your domination, your status of recognition.

13:57.500 --> 14:02.500
It is not necessary that there are direct or inverse proportional connections.

14:02.500 --> 14:07.500
The problem is that a person, as an active being,

14:07.500 --> 14:11.500
can list the necessary conditions for his comfort.

14:11.500 --> 14:16.500
Here, of course, the food, warmth, clothing,

14:16.500 --> 14:20.500
what is called vital needs, if we take, for example, Maslow,

14:20.500 --> 14:23.500
but this is a broader concept.

14:24.500 --> 14:28.500
There are necessities that are necessary for your existence.

14:28.500 --> 14:41.500
And there are conditions of well-being that make your life more satisfying.

14:43.500 --> 14:49.500
In addition to the fact that Rotor considers these six categories of needs,

14:49.500 --> 14:52.500
he understands that the need is a very broad concept.

14:52.500 --> 14:59.500
And in this regard, if I want to operationalize this concept,

14:59.500 --> 15:05.500
to make it measurable, I must introduce some other measurable coefficients.

15:05.500 --> 15:11.500
Therefore, he divides the needs into three components.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.500
In addition to the six categories that we just talked about,

15:14.500 --> 15:19.500
he divides all the needs of a person into three components.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.500
The first component is the potential of need.

15:21.500 --> 15:28.500
That is, the results that I want to achieve.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.500
The need is why I behave this way.

15:31.500 --> 15:36.500
The potential is why I set these tasks for myself.

15:36.500 --> 15:41.500
Again, I can set myself a problem of physical comfort

15:42.500 --> 15:48.500
in terms of potential of need, like a summer cottage, a car, a plane, a yacht,

15:48.500 --> 15:50.500
a vacation in Courchevel, and so on.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.500
I can set myself a problem of physical comfort,

15:54.500 --> 15:59.500
like going to a wilderness, not even to a village, but to the woods,

15:59.500 --> 16:02.500
so that no one is there, and to be alone for a week,

16:02.500 --> 16:09.500
without phones, without computers, just you and nature,

16:09.500 --> 16:11.500
and so that there are no people around.

16:11.500 --> 16:16.500
Again, each person sets the potential of his needs.

16:16.500 --> 16:21.500
Moreover, the potential of this need depends on the social environment,

16:21.500 --> 16:27.500
on the tasks that arise in society.

16:27.500 --> 16:33.500
If I have something superfluous, I am ready to get rid of it,

16:33.500 --> 16:37.500
even with the loss of the usual physical comfort.

16:38.500 --> 16:44.500
In addition to the potential of need, Rotor also introduces the value of need.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.500
Look, again, the value.

16:47.500 --> 16:52.500
It has already been in the theory of social learning as the value of reinforcement.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.500
The value in this case again reflects the subjectivity.

16:55.500 --> 17:02.500
It is an assessment of the need that I want to achieve.

17:02.500 --> 17:07.500
And the assessment of others, my social environment of this need.

17:07.500 --> 17:16.500
For example, I can invest all my money to buy a work of art.

17:16.500 --> 17:27.500
At the same time, for example, my country house burned down,

17:27.500 --> 17:30.500
my wife left, I am not interested in that.

17:30.500 --> 17:36.500
I invest all my money in a work of art, so that it is hanging on the wall, and so on.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.500
And everything else is secondary.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.500
I have set my values and needs.

17:41.500 --> 17:47.500
They can be socially acceptable or socially unacceptable.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
This is the second question.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.500
The activity comes from a person,

17:51.500 --> 17:57.500
and I subjectively set the desires and needs that I have.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.500
And the third component, again, is very interesting.

18:01.500 --> 18:06.500
All these three components, potential of need, value of need,

18:06.500 --> 18:13.500
they are aimed at revealing the subjectivity of a person.

18:13.500 --> 18:18.500
Subjectivity is like those internal variables that he has.

18:18.500 --> 18:24.500
So, the next component is the freedom of activity and minimally set goals.

18:25.500 --> 18:31.500
In fact, this component reflects the situation that,

18:31.500 --> 18:38.500
being a social being, a person is not free in his actions.

18:38.500 --> 18:44.500
If we walk down the street and see that McDonald's is selling hamburgers,

18:44.500 --> 18:48.500
and we are hungry, we want to eat, we are happy to eat hamburgers,

18:48.500 --> 18:51.500
but suddenly it is discovered that we have no money with us,

18:51.500 --> 18:54.500
and we have a card that is not served in McDonald's,

18:54.500 --> 18:57.500
then our freedom is limited.

18:57.500 --> 19:01.500
Here is a hamburger, but you cannot take it,

19:01.500 --> 19:05.500
because there are certain social requirements,

19:05.500 --> 19:08.500
that you can buy it, and you can buy it for money,

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
but you don't have it now.

19:10.500 --> 19:17.500
And it turns out that, although you can take one step to satisfy your needs,

19:17.500 --> 19:25.500
you cannot do it, simply because you don't have the necessary components

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
to achieve this step.

19:28.500 --> 19:34.500
In this regard, when Rotter talks about freedom of activity,

19:34.500 --> 19:37.500
he introduces the concept of minimal goal.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
In fact, we have already talked about this.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.500
Each person sets his own level of commitments,

19:43.500 --> 19:49.500
and in this regard there are high, lofty, ideal goals,

19:49.500 --> 19:53.500
which I want to achieve,

19:53.500 --> 19:59.500
but there are those minimal goals that I have to achieve.

19:59.500 --> 20:04.500
I may want to be the general director,

20:04.500 --> 20:08.500
but it didn't work out, it doesn't matter why.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.500
Is it my fault, or the circumstances?

20:12.500 --> 20:18.500
But my minimal goal is to become the head of the department.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.500
Yes, even if I didn't go to the company at 30,

20:21.500 --> 20:24.500
but still I became the head.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.500
Yes, it didn't work out to become the general director,

20:27.500 --> 20:32.500
I will find an excuse, and, accordingly, I will reduce the value,

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
I will change the efficiency,

20:34.500 --> 20:37.500
but if the minimal goal is not achieved,

20:37.500 --> 20:42.500
then it is a collapse of the human efficiency,

20:42.500 --> 20:45.500
and, accordingly, in this situation,

20:45.500 --> 20:54.500
there is a need to achieve this goal in one way or another.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.500
My freedom is limited by other people,

20:57.500 --> 21:02.500
but other people present an opportunity to achieve at least one goal.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.500
If I don't achieve this goal,

21:04.500 --> 21:07.500
even if I don't become the head of the department,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
if I don't achieve the minimal goal,

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
then I will become a despot in the family.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
Even if my wife suffers,

21:13.500 --> 21:15.500
I will have children,

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
I will quarrel with my mother-in-law,

21:17.500 --> 21:25.500
I somehow managed to imitate the fact that I became the head.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.500
Nobody in my family wants to talk to me,

21:28.500 --> 21:31.500
they don't want to contact me.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.500
But I achieved that goal for myself,

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
I gave it an assessment,

21:37.500 --> 21:42.500
and my efficiency was saved by the assessment along with it.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
In this regard,

21:44.500 --> 21:51.500
the Rotor, after introducing categories and three components of the needs,

21:51.500 --> 21:56.500
clarifies its original formula of behavior prognosis,

21:56.500 --> 21:58.500
and before it, I remind you,

21:58.500 --> 22:02.500
there is a task in the theory of social decision-making to build a behavior prognosis.

22:02.500 --> 22:09.500
It now says that if earlier the potential of behavior was in the sum of expectations and values of reinforcement,

22:09.500 --> 22:13.500
now I introduce new components

22:13.500 --> 22:23.500
that allow me to reduce the breakdown of concepts

22:23.500 --> 22:27.500
and simplify the measurement procedure.

22:27.500 --> 22:33.500
Now it considers that the general formula of the needs prognosis

22:33.500 --> 22:41.500
is that the potential of the needs is equal to the sum of the freedom of activity and the value of the needs.

22:41.500 --> 22:46.500
Look, earlier the formula was expectations plus the value of reinforcement.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.500
A wide breakdown of information,

22:50.500 --> 22:54.500
based on the four variables previously introduced by the Rotor.

22:54.500 --> 22:59.500
Now, after adding six more categories of needs to these four variables,

22:59.500 --> 23:01.500
plus three components of the needs,

23:01.500 --> 23:05.500
it introduces the concept of freedom of activity as

23:05.500 --> 23:08.500
freedom of activity is my activity,

23:08.500 --> 23:13.500
but my activity is limited by the social environment that exists.

23:13.500 --> 23:17.500
There are not many local social ladders,

23:17.500 --> 23:19.500
there are a lot of applicants.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.500
All this limits my freedom,

23:22.500 --> 23:27.500
but in addition to this, there is my inner expectation,

23:27.500 --> 23:32.500
inner assessment of the values that I give to the needs.

23:32.500 --> 23:39.500
Therefore, if I want to better understand the potential of my needs,

23:39.500 --> 23:42.500
what I want to achieve and why I want to achieve it,

23:42.500 --> 23:46.500
I must start from the component of freedom of activity

23:46.500 --> 23:50.500
and from the category of the value of the needs.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.500
This is what concerns the potential of the needs.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
And from the point of view of the Rotor,

23:56.500 --> 24:00.500
based on this formula, I can already assess the potential of the needs.

24:00.500 --> 24:06.500
It should be noted that the measurements conducted

24:06.500 --> 24:13.500
by the Rotor showed that if we use the scales developed by the Rotor,

24:13.500 --> 24:19.500
we can build, let's say,

24:19.500 --> 24:26.500
much better forecasts than other psychological theories

24:26.500 --> 24:32.500
or theories related to the organizational behavior that we are engaged in.

24:32.500 --> 24:37.500
Of course, they do not give us a definite result,

24:37.500 --> 24:41.500
but compared to other approaches,

24:41.500 --> 24:44.500
this approach really agrees with the practice,

24:44.500 --> 24:50.500
and it is especially good in the analysis of business behavior,

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
the behavior of people in the organization,

24:52.500 --> 24:56.500
organizational activity of a person.

24:57.500 --> 25:05.500
But still, perhaps, the most famous achievement of the Rotor

25:05.500 --> 25:09.500
is not so much the theory of social learning,

25:09.500 --> 25:14.500
which is well known by specialists who often use it,

25:14.500 --> 25:16.500
not so much its theory of needs,

25:16.500 --> 25:19.500
which, again, is known by specialists who use it,

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
who use it, who use it,

25:21.500 --> 25:23.500
who use it, who use it,

25:23.500 --> 25:26.500
and so various explanatory schemes are built.

25:26.500 --> 25:36.500
The Rotor is widely known as a person who has the concept of the locus of control.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
As for the locus of control,

25:38.500 --> 25:44.500
it is another characteristic of the needs that a person has.

25:45.500 --> 25:50.500
It is a generalized expectation.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.500
Remember the expectation as a variable

25:54.500 --> 25:57.500
with which we analyze social interaction.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.500
The locus of control is a generalized expectation

26:01.500 --> 26:08.500
of the extent to which people are able to control and reinforce their lives.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
A person is an active being,

26:10.500 --> 26:16.500
and a person builds on the basis of the operative reinforcement of the skinner.

26:16.500 --> 26:26.500
A person builds his behavior from the point of view of the analysis of the consequences that arise here.

26:26.500 --> 26:30.500
The Rotor introduces the category of the locus of control,

26:30.500 --> 26:35.500
and it introduces it precisely so that it is possible to measure expectations.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.500
It creates a questionnaire on the locus of control

26:39.500 --> 26:45.500
and, accordingly, its task is to measure such a subjective thing as expectations.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.500
And it succeeds.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.500
From the point of view of the Rotor,

26:50.500 --> 26:54.500
which has conducted a large number of experiments,

26:54.500 --> 26:57.500
conducted a factor analysis of its data,

26:57.500 --> 27:02.500
it turned out that the whole large community of people

27:02.500 --> 27:05.500
with their abundance of internal variables,

27:05.500 --> 27:09.500
immersed in the abundance of external stimuli,

27:09.500 --> 27:12.500
can be divided into two categories.

27:12.500 --> 27:16.500
These are externals and internals.

27:18.500 --> 27:21.500
Again, as for the Rotor,

27:21.500 --> 27:24.500
its concept of locus of control

27:24.500 --> 27:33.500
is very much in line with the concept of Jung's introverts-extroverts.

27:34.500 --> 27:39.500
However, if for Jung, from the point of view of behaviorists,

27:39.500 --> 27:43.500
these are very poorly measurable concepts,

27:43.500 --> 27:47.500
then instead of these concepts, introverts-extroverts,

27:47.500 --> 27:55.500
the Rotor will be measurable from the point of view of behaviorism,

27:55.500 --> 27:58.500
the concept of externals and internals.

27:58.500 --> 28:03.500
An external is a person who assumes

28:03.500 --> 28:11.500
that the control over his reaction, behavior, and expectations lies outside.

28:11.500 --> 28:18.500
External stimuli are dominant from the point of view of determining any achievements,

28:18.500 --> 28:21.500
and little depends on a person.

28:22.500 --> 28:30.500
External is a typical object of Skinner's study.

28:30.500 --> 28:34.500
A person who has abandoned internal activity,

28:34.500 --> 28:38.500
is under the influence of external stimuli.

28:38.500 --> 28:42.500
Internals are quite the opposite.

28:42.500 --> 28:49.500
Internals are those people whose locus of control is inside them.

28:49.500 --> 28:56.500
They are those people who pay a lot of attention to their internal variables.

28:56.500 --> 29:05.500
All external stimuli that act on them are analyzed, processed by internal variables,

29:05.500 --> 29:08.500
and go through an internal cognitive map.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.500
Only after this analysis,

29:11.500 --> 29:18.500
only after the analysis of possible consequences of different behavioral variants,

29:18.500 --> 29:21.500
only in this case,

29:21.500 --> 29:26.500
the variant that suits a person is chosen.

29:26.500 --> 29:32.500
If externals are the people by external circumstances,

29:32.500 --> 29:37.500
then internals are the people by their cognitive circumstances.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.500
As for the concept of locus of control,

29:42.500 --> 29:48.500
it had a significant impact on the whole cognitive-behavioral direction,

29:48.500 --> 29:56.500
because it allowed to build a scale of expectations,

29:56.500 --> 30:01.500
with pluses of external and internal.

30:02.500 --> 30:08.500
Again, we should pay attention to the fact that there are no pure externals.

30:08.500 --> 30:13.500
If a person is mentally healthy, then there are no pure externals and pure internals.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.500
There are no people who are in the locus of control.

30:16.500 --> 30:20.500
Someone is completely dependent on external circumstances,

30:20.500 --> 30:23.500
someone makes decisions on their own.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.500
Even if we take a newborn child,

30:26.500 --> 30:29.500
who seems to be completely dependent on external influence,

30:29.500 --> 30:38.500
he still quickly forms his needs, his interests, his desires.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.500
He smiles to someone, he cries to someone.

30:41.500 --> 30:49.500
Thus, he starts to let all these external factors through the inner world.

30:49.500 --> 30:56.500
And he achieves the desired reaction in normal situations by this crying.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.500
Again, there are no pure externals,

31:00.500 --> 31:08.500
because no mentally healthy person will be immersed in his own thinking.

31:08.500 --> 31:12.500
Just because if you have an 8-hour working day,

31:12.500 --> 31:16.500
and you come and start to think about what you should do at work today,

31:16.500 --> 31:18.500
you will think for a day, two, three.

31:18.500 --> 31:22.500
Then you will be asked, what did you do in the past week?

31:22.500 --> 31:24.500
And then you will have the following conclusions.

31:25.500 --> 31:29.500
People are on this scale.

31:29.500 --> 31:33.500
They are closer to the external end, closer to the internal end.

31:33.500 --> 31:39.500
They have priority behaviors, priority ways of reacting.

31:39.500 --> 31:43.500
And as for these priority behaviors and reactions,

31:43.500 --> 31:51.500
they determine our behavior, our expectations,

31:51.500 --> 31:54.500
they determine our dominance, our status,

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
they determine the value of our support,

31:56.500 --> 32:02.500
and they make possible the prediction of the potential of our behavior.

32:02.500 --> 32:09.500
This is what concerns the cognitive-behavioral approach

32:09.500 --> 32:14.500
and the direction that was developed by Rotor.

32:15.500 --> 32:24.500
These are the main directions that exist in the theory of learning from the behavioral point of view.

32:24.500 --> 32:29.500
But we see that starting from radical behaviorism,

32:29.500 --> 32:31.500
from the stimulus reaction,

32:31.500 --> 32:35.500
gradually the same behaviorism more and more

32:35.500 --> 32:38.500
takes into account the internal qualities,

32:38.500 --> 32:41.500
the internal properties, the internal needs of a person.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.500
Motives, needs.

32:42.500 --> 32:50.500
It doesn't matter that behaviorists formulate them in an unusual psychological way.

32:50.500 --> 32:56.500
Moreover, they formulate them in a way that there is an opportunity to measure the corresponding results.

32:56.500 --> 33:05.500
But behaviorists, solving the original task of explanation, analysis, measurement,

33:05.500 --> 33:07.500
control of human behavior,

33:07.500 --> 33:15.500
come to the conclusion that if we want to solve the task of prediction of human behavior,

33:15.500 --> 33:18.500
we must take into account the internal variables,

33:18.500 --> 33:20.500
that is, the internal world of a person.

33:20.500 --> 33:31.500
And, of course, reality itself leads them to the recognition of the human mental activity.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.500
But as for the mental activity of a person,

33:35.500 --> 33:38.500
which they left from initially,

33:38.500 --> 33:40.500
because Otson, creating behaviorism,

33:40.500 --> 33:46.500
was principally distancing himself from the psyche until scientists themselves understood it.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.500
Well, if they didn't understand it, we will study behavior.

33:49.500 --> 33:55.500
About 50 years after the emergence of behaviorism,

33:55.500 --> 34:00.500
behaviorism, in fact, came close to the cognitive direction,

34:00.500 --> 34:09.500
which is associated with the ideas of how a person lives, how a person thinks.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.500
As for the cognitive approach,

34:12.500 --> 34:17.500
the representatives of this direction come from one simple thing.

34:17.500 --> 34:23.500
Yes, behaviorists, moreover, as well as any other cognitiveist,

34:23.500 --> 34:30.500
psychologist, they are in solidarity with behaviorists in terms of measurability,

34:30.500 --> 34:33.500
in terms of experimentality.

34:33.500 --> 34:38.500
But the representatives of the cognitive direction come from the fact that

34:38.500 --> 34:43.500
the unconditional difference between a person and all other animals

34:44.500 --> 34:53.500
is that a person possesses a wide range of developed cognitive abilities.

34:53.500 --> 34:58.500
A person is capable of thinking, a person is capable of thinking,

34:58.500 --> 35:01.500
a person is capable of solving abstract problems.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.500
The same animals can solve problems,

35:04.500 --> 35:09.500
and monkeys, dogs, rats, mice,

35:10.500 --> 35:14.500
they also solve the problem of finding food,

35:14.500 --> 35:21.500
they can solve the problem of saving and moving according to their norms.

35:21.500 --> 35:25.500
But as for a person, unlike all other, in any case,

35:25.500 --> 35:28.500
currently known animals,

35:28.500 --> 35:32.500
only a person has a cognitive structure,

35:32.500 --> 35:37.500
with which a person is able to transmit his inner feelings,

35:37.500 --> 35:41.500
his vision of the world, his perception of the world to another person.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.500
A person has speech, he has a notion.

35:44.500 --> 35:49.500
Due to the existence of this cognitive structure,

35:49.500 --> 35:56.500
a person is able to think, to know the world,

35:56.500 --> 36:04.500
and to know this world is considerably deeper than a person needs for his survival.

36:05.500 --> 36:09.500
Indeed, what concerns the knowledge of the world,

36:09.500 --> 36:12.500
which was inherent in our ancestors 50-100 thousand years ago,

36:12.500 --> 36:15.500
it was more than enough for them to survive,

36:15.500 --> 36:19.500
simply because, since we exist, this proves it.

36:19.500 --> 36:25.500
A person is perfectly able to provide conditions for his existence,

36:25.500 --> 36:29.500
survival, and from this point of view,

36:29.500 --> 36:32.500
he is adequately adapted to reality.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.500
But as for a person,

36:36.500 --> 36:42.500
his thinking has spread to those spheres of reality,

36:42.500 --> 36:47.500
which are not directly connected with his survival.

36:47.500 --> 36:52.500
Let's take the universe, let's take the micro-world.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.500
Of course, this can be interesting.

36:55.500 --> 36:59.500
But not everyone understands the laws of quantum mechanics in the micro-world,

36:59.500 --> 37:02.500
and the laws of quantum mechanics in the mega-world,

37:02.500 --> 37:04.500
the theory of relativity.

37:04.500 --> 37:09.500
But, for the duration of our lives, 50, 70, 100, 150 years,

37:09.500 --> 37:12.500
none of us will fall into the micro-world,

37:12.500 --> 37:15.500
none of us will be in other universes.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
This is an excess of knowledge.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.500
But a person is engaged in this knowledge,

37:20.500 --> 37:24.500
a person devotes time to this knowledge,

37:24.500 --> 37:27.500
this knowledge is socially demanded.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
Why is it needed?

37:29.500 --> 37:33.500
And the cognitivists set and solve this problem.

37:33.500 --> 37:39.500
A person has thinking, a person has cognitive mechanisms.

37:39.500 --> 37:43.500
And since they exist, they are needed for some reason.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.500
Nature is very simple.

37:46.500 --> 37:51.500
All excess qualities and properties that are not used,

37:51.500 --> 37:54.500
are taken away and disappear.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.500
If the thinking of a person has not disappeared,

37:58.500 --> 38:06.500
and it is pleasant to realize and it is believed that it is increasing and deepening,

38:06.500 --> 38:08.500
although this is a controversial question,

38:08.500 --> 38:12.500
then, accordingly, let's start from the fact that

38:12.500 --> 38:16.500
cognition, cognitive properties, cognitive functions

38:16.500 --> 38:23.500
are a significant characteristic necessary for the survival and adaptation of a person.

38:23.500 --> 38:27.500
And this is the basic idea of the cognitive approach.

38:27.500 --> 38:31.500
As for the cognitive approach,

38:31.500 --> 38:38.500
from this point of view, it pays principal attention to education and learning.

38:38.500 --> 38:41.500
From the point of view of the cognitivists,

38:41.500 --> 38:44.500
a person is, in fact, a researcher,

38:44.500 --> 38:49.500
striving to understand and interpret what is happening to him in the world,

38:49.500 --> 38:52.500
what is happening in the world that surrounds him.

38:52.500 --> 38:59.500
And this is not to write a dissertation,

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
to make any discovery,

39:01.500 --> 39:06.500
but to understand what is happening in the world from the point of view of prediction.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.500
What dangers may exist in this world?

39:09.500 --> 39:13.500
What problems may exist in this world?

39:13.500 --> 39:16.500
What conditions may exist in this world?

39:17.500 --> 39:21.500
In this regard,

39:21.500 --> 39:31.500
a person is considered as an ordinary scientist, an ordinary researcher.

39:31.500 --> 39:36.500
If I find myself in a new environment for myself,

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
I must study it.

39:38.500 --> 39:43.500
Let's recall those situations when we find ourselves in some new room,

39:43.500 --> 39:47.500
in a new room, in a new group, when we come to a new job.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.500
Where do we start?

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
We start by getting acquainted,

39:51.500 --> 39:54.500
learning about the rules,

39:54.500 --> 39:58.500
finding out what is approved and what is not.

39:58.500 --> 40:02.500
We explore a new environment of our stay.

40:02.500 --> 40:06.500
If we come to work, we will work there for some time,

40:06.500 --> 40:11.500
and, accordingly, we will work not alone, but with other people.

40:11.500 --> 40:14.500
We need to know the rules and norms that exist there.

40:14.500 --> 40:21.500
We need to know and be able to interpret the forms of behavior that exist there

40:21.500 --> 40:24.500
in order to be properly understood.

40:24.500 --> 40:28.500
And if, for example, someone made a mistake,

40:28.500 --> 40:32.500
and this was made known to the management,

40:32.500 --> 40:34.500
it is not a trick.

40:34.500 --> 40:40.500
It is just a normal norm of attitude in this company,

40:40.500 --> 40:45.500
because this or that mistake can have a significant impact

40:45.500 --> 40:50.500
on the final results that will be achieved in this company.

40:50.500 --> 40:53.500
So, a person is a researcher.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
And if a person is a researcher,

40:55.500 --> 41:03.500
all his actions, all his behavior is primarily related to acquiring new knowledge,

41:03.500 --> 41:06.500
acquiring new information.

41:06.500 --> 41:12.500
Knowledge from the point of view of fundamental physics or mathematics,

41:12.500 --> 41:15.500
knowledge in the environment where I live,

41:15.500 --> 41:19.500
where I am, knowledge in the environment where I am.

41:20.500 --> 41:24.500
The most prominent figure of the cognitive approach,

41:24.500 --> 41:27.500
in fact, one of his chiefs,

41:27.500 --> 41:30.500
was George Alexander Kelly.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.500
As for Kelly,

41:33.500 --> 41:41.500
the main idea is what is the cognitive ability of a person.

41:41.500 --> 41:46.500
The cognitive ability of a person is an organization of a cycle

41:46.500 --> 41:49.500
of orientation in the world around,

41:49.500 --> 41:54.500
the choice of possible behavior options,

41:54.500 --> 41:58.500
and, finally, the execution of one or another option.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.500
So, orientation, choice, execution.

42:01.500 --> 42:04.500
Again, in a significant way,

42:04.500 --> 42:08.500
this is intersected with the cognitive behavioral approach,

42:08.500 --> 42:10.500
when we talk about internal changes,

42:10.500 --> 42:13.500
with the bandura and the rotor, with its social environment.

42:13.500 --> 42:19.500
But if behavioralists came from external stimuli

42:19.500 --> 42:22.500
and internal stimuli, internal changes,

42:22.500 --> 42:25.500
then Kelly is basically based on the fact

42:25.500 --> 42:29.500
that a person has the ability to learn.

42:29.500 --> 42:33.500
A person is a researcher, a person learns all his life.

42:33.500 --> 42:37.500
And he learns neither at school, nor in the family, nor in kindergarten.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
This is one of the forms of learning.

42:39.500 --> 42:43.500
Whatever a person encounters, it is a learning.

42:43.500 --> 42:50.500
Because he must be oriented in the environment

42:50.500 --> 42:51.500
where he is.

42:51.500 --> 42:56.500
A new place, a new house, a new car,

42:56.500 --> 43:01.500
a new way of moving, skates, rollerskates, something else.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.500
I must be oriented in what it is.

43:04.500 --> 43:08.500
I must understand what dangers there may be,

43:08.500 --> 43:12.500
what are the advantages, what are the disadvantages.

43:12.500 --> 43:16.500
I must get a certain choice of options,

43:16.500 --> 43:22.500
a choice of options I need to implement those or other actions.

43:22.500 --> 43:26.500
And after I know these options,

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
after I get oriented in them,

43:28.500 --> 43:32.500
I implement some option, I do something.

43:32.500 --> 43:36.500
And then I look, whether it was successful or not.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.500
Did I achieve what I wanted? No.

43:38.500 --> 43:43.500
But if behavioralists had consequences of behavior

43:43.500 --> 43:47.500
as the main result of solving this problem,

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
stimulus, internal change reaction,

43:49.500 --> 43:53.500
then the principle of Kili is different.

43:53.500 --> 43:58.500
Each person has some constructs in his head,

43:58.500 --> 44:02.500
some conceptual, verbal schemes

44:02.500 --> 44:06.500
with which a person describes the world.

44:06.500 --> 44:09.500
And a person is not Skinner's rat.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.500
Skinner liked to do experiments with rats.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.500
We talked about it.

44:15.500 --> 44:19.500
In the sense that he works with his trial and error.

44:19.500 --> 44:23.500
He pressed the key, the food fell, I will press further.

44:23.500 --> 44:26.500
He stumbled somewhere, got under tension,

44:26.500 --> 44:30.500
I will not come to this place in the cage anymore.

44:30.500 --> 44:33.500
A person does not work according to the method of trial and error.

44:33.500 --> 44:40.500
A person is not so primitive to fill himself with bumps.

44:40.500 --> 44:47.500
A person works from the point of view of the picture of the world in his head.

44:47.500 --> 44:52.500
From the point of view of the knowledge he received,

44:52.500 --> 44:55.500
seeing what happened to others,

44:55.500 --> 44:58.500
what they did, what they didn't do.

44:58.500 --> 45:01.500
And then, after I am in the head,

45:01.500 --> 45:04.500
not in practice, as Bandura,

45:04.500 --> 45:06.500
from the point of view of modeling,

45:06.500 --> 45:09.500
not Rotter, from the point of view of social learning,

45:09.500 --> 45:13.500
but in the head, guided by his inner criteria,

45:13.500 --> 45:18.500
his cognitive, cognitive, his experience.

45:18.500 --> 45:25.500
Here, we can easily use all our favorite psychological terms.

45:25.500 --> 45:29.500
So, based on my inner criteria,

45:29.500 --> 45:32.500
based on my experience, my memory,

45:32.500 --> 45:38.500
only based on them, I already interpret what is happening in the world,

45:38.500 --> 45:46.500
I already choose how I will behave in this or that situation.

45:46.500 --> 45:51.500
A person is a thinker who thinks how to behave,

45:51.500 --> 45:54.500
and then he gains experience.

45:54.500 --> 45:57.500
A person is not a rat that behaves,

45:57.500 --> 46:02.500
and then he considers the loss of his body.

46:02.500 --> 46:06.500
So, this is the basic idea of the cognitive approach,

46:06.500 --> 46:12.500
which, of course, Kelly finds its expression in more specific sentences.

46:12.500 --> 46:15.500
Now we will consider these sentences.

46:15.500 --> 46:20.500
In fact, all the cognitive theories of George Alexander Kelly

46:20.500 --> 46:24.500
are the theory of building, education,

46:24.500 --> 46:28.500
the theory of learning and development of a person in general.

46:28.500 --> 46:33.500
Kelly comes from the idea of constructive alternativeism.

46:33.500 --> 46:38.500
With the help of personal constructs,

46:38.500 --> 46:40.500
a person describes reality.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.500
A personal construct is a set of terms

46:43.500 --> 46:47.500
with which I create a picture of the world.

46:47.500 --> 46:54.500
A personal construct is built on the principle of similarity and difference.

46:54.500 --> 46:56.500
It is dichotomous, double.

46:56.500 --> 47:03.500
At the same time, Kelly comes from the idea that each person has his own personal constructs,

47:03.500 --> 47:06.500
his own interpretations, his own approaches.

47:06.500 --> 47:09.500
But with the help of these constructs, a person interprets the surrounding world.

47:09.500 --> 47:13.500
The world in which he lives, where other people live,

47:13.500 --> 47:16.500
where all these interactions take place.

47:16.500 --> 47:20.500
But each person has his own interpretation, because the constructs are his own.

47:20.500 --> 47:24.500
And in this connection, a constructive alternativeism arises,

47:24.500 --> 47:26.500
freedom of choice.

47:26.500 --> 47:30.500
I draw the world for myself as I see it.

47:30.500 --> 47:34.500
And then, if I want to exchange my view of the world with another,

47:34.500 --> 47:40.500
I can do it because we use the same terms, the same concepts.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.500
We give them different meanings.

47:43.500 --> 47:48.500
If we compare what the elements of the world look like,

47:48.500 --> 47:51.500
what are their differences, we can come to the understanding

47:51.500 --> 47:55.500
that each person has his own personal constructs.

47:55.500 --> 47:59.500
But because people describe the same world,

47:59.500 --> 48:02.500
because people speak the same language,

48:02.500 --> 48:06.500
they are able to come to understand each other.

48:06.500 --> 48:10.500
However, in order to achieve this understanding,

48:10.500 --> 48:14.500
people have to go through a learning process.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.500
They have to learn in the same culture,

48:17.500 --> 48:21.500
they have to learn by the same construct,

48:21.500 --> 48:26.500
they have to speak the same language, the same cognitive language.

48:26.500 --> 48:33.500
At the same time, as with the Rotor,

48:33.500 --> 48:37.500
from the point of view of the cell, why do we need all these constructs?

48:37.500 --> 48:39.500
Why do we need a cognitive map?

48:39.500 --> 48:41.500
Why do we need knowledge?

48:41.500 --> 48:45.500
We need all this in order to be able to predict

48:45.500 --> 48:49.500
what will happen in this world, what will happen in this world,

48:49.500 --> 48:52.500
and how to avoid negative consequences,

48:52.500 --> 48:55.500
to increase and expand what interests me.

48:55.500 --> 48:59.500
As for the Kelly theory,

48:59.500 --> 49:04.500
it has one main postulate and 11 consequences.

49:04.500 --> 49:07.500
The main postulate of Kelly is very simple.

49:07.500 --> 49:11.500
Kelly states that human activity,

49:11.500 --> 49:14.500
activity, thinking,

49:14.500 --> 49:18.500
since Kelly refers to cognitivists,

49:18.500 --> 49:22.500
he perceives activity not only as behavior,

49:22.500 --> 49:25.500
but also as an internal mental activity,

49:25.500 --> 49:28.500
the consequence of which is behavior.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.500
From the point of view of Kelly,

49:30.500 --> 49:34.500
human activity is determined,

49:34.500 --> 49:39.500
guided by the ways in which he predicts events.

49:39.500 --> 49:41.500
It's a simple thought.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.500
Any person, researcher,

49:43.500 --> 49:46.500
subjective scientist, ordinary scientist,

49:46.500 --> 49:48.500
why does he study this world?

49:48.500 --> 49:53.500
He studies this world in order to make it predictable.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.500
Only in that world I feel comfortable,

49:55.500 --> 49:57.500
only in that world I feel calm,

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
where I know what to expect,

49:59.500 --> 50:02.500
where I know what problems may occur,

50:02.500 --> 50:05.500
what circumstances may arise,

50:05.500 --> 50:07.500
where I know what's behind the corner,

50:07.500 --> 50:10.500
where I know that no one will attack me from behind.

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
That's a simple thought.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
And really, judge for yourself,

50:14.500 --> 50:19.500
I don't think this postulate will cause a lot of disputes.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.500
We feel calm in the usual environment.

50:22.500 --> 50:23.500
Why?

50:23.500 --> 50:25.500
Because we know everything there.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.500
We may not like it,

50:27.500 --> 50:29.500
we may not be satisfied,

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
but we feel calm there,

50:31.500 --> 50:35.500
because we know where, who, what, where to expect what.

50:35.500 --> 50:40.500
If a person finds himself in a new situation,

50:40.500 --> 50:44.500
there's no need to necessarily go to an extreme situation.

50:44.500 --> 50:47.500
A person went to the subway station,

50:47.500 --> 50:50.500
where he had never been before.

50:50.500 --> 50:56.500
And suddenly he decided to buy a pie or something else in a kiosk.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.500
Something he hadn't done before.

50:58.500 --> 51:03.500
Naturally, a person already has certain expectations.

51:03.500 --> 51:05.500
What can be waiting for him?

51:05.500 --> 51:07.500
That the pie may not be fried,

51:07.500 --> 51:09.500
that there may be a confection,

51:09.500 --> 51:12.500
that these pies are made from a dog, and so on.

51:12.500 --> 51:14.500
That is, he is already...

51:14.500 --> 51:17.500
After all, a person is not Robinson.

51:17.500 --> 51:20.500
He lives in this world, in this social environment.

51:20.500 --> 51:23.500
And naturally, living in this environment,

51:23.500 --> 51:27.500
he is interested in making himself comfortable in this environment.

51:27.500 --> 51:31.500
He will be comfortable only if he has information

51:31.500 --> 51:34.500
about what is waiting for him in this world.

51:34.500 --> 51:37.500
That is, what events are happening here,

51:37.500 --> 51:41.500
and can predict what will happen in a while.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.500
Based on this postulate,

51:43.500 --> 51:45.500
Kelly emphasizes once again,

51:45.500 --> 51:48.500
and this is the result of this main postulate,

51:48.500 --> 51:52.500
that the existence of a person is, first of all,

51:52.500 --> 51:55.500
a cognitive, that is, a cognitive process.

51:55.500 --> 52:01.500
Any behavior of a person, any action, any approach,

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
is a learning.

52:03.500 --> 52:07.500
If we are in a familiar environment,

52:07.500 --> 52:10.500
where it becomes boring,

52:10.500 --> 52:13.500
we have a reason for development.

52:13.500 --> 52:17.500
What will happen if something changes?

52:17.500 --> 52:20.500
For example, one lamp went out today,

52:20.500 --> 52:23.500
tomorrow it will be the second, the third.

52:23.500 --> 52:26.500
How many lamps can remain

52:26.500 --> 52:29.500
to be able to work?

52:31.500 --> 52:38.500
Accordingly, a person begins to learn the world,

52:38.500 --> 52:43.500
to create an environment of learning,

52:43.500 --> 52:48.500
even in the conditions when there is nothing to learn.

52:48.500 --> 52:52.500
And this is a normal adaptive mechanism.

52:52.500 --> 52:56.500
It is better to predict than to be unprepared

52:56.500 --> 52:59.500
for the changes that will happen.

52:59.500 --> 53:05.500
Kelly assumes that the learning of the world around him

53:06.500 --> 53:11.500
is happening in the process of modeling this world.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.500
And modeling in the broadest sense of the word.

53:14.500 --> 53:17.500
This is not the modeling that Bandura has.

53:17.500 --> 53:20.500
When there is a model,

53:20.500 --> 53:23.500
and we try to learn,

53:23.500 --> 53:26.500
to achieve the same results as this model.

53:26.500 --> 53:29.500
Under the modeling, Kelly understands

53:29.500 --> 53:33.500
the construction of a cognitive map of the whole world.

53:33.500 --> 53:36.500
This is the modeling of another person.

53:36.500 --> 53:39.500
This is the construction of predictions

53:39.500 --> 53:42.500
about what will happen in this world.

53:42.500 --> 53:45.500
This is the reflection on what I want to achieve,

53:45.500 --> 53:47.500
why I need it,

53:47.500 --> 53:50.500
whether it is worth working for me,

53:50.500 --> 53:53.500
where and how to work, what to do.

53:53.500 --> 53:57.500
In fact, this is a selection of different alternative options.

53:57.500 --> 54:00.500
The more alternative options I have selected,

54:00.500 --> 54:03.500
the more opportunities I can choose.

54:03.500 --> 54:06.500
The more I have a choice,

54:06.500 --> 54:10.500
the more opportunities I have to predict

54:10.500 --> 54:14.500
what I have not yet encountered.

54:14.500 --> 54:18.500
This is why the Kelly cognitive mechanisms are needed.

54:18.500 --> 54:22.500
It should be said that the personal constructs

54:22.500 --> 54:25.500
that are in a person's head

54:25.500 --> 54:29.500
are not autonomous elements.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.500
What we were talking about

54:32.500 --> 54:35.500
when we were considering the construction

54:35.500 --> 54:38.500
of cognitive-behavioral theories,

54:38.500 --> 54:41.500
that everything is tied to the system,

54:41.500 --> 54:44.500
finds its bright embodiment in Kelly.

54:44.500 --> 54:47.500
All personal constructs are tied to each other.

54:47.500 --> 54:52.500
Of course, if we understand business well,

54:52.500 --> 54:56.500
then the corresponding information

54:57.500 --> 55:02.500
is quickly associated with the existing information,

55:02.500 --> 55:05.500
compared to what we know,

55:05.500 --> 55:08.500
and analyzed as what is new in this information.

55:08.500 --> 55:12.500
In this case, it turns out that we acquire knowledge

55:12.500 --> 55:16.500
that is built into the existing system.

55:16.500 --> 55:19.500
In this regard, if we encounter

55:19.500 --> 55:22.500
absolutely new knowledge,

55:22.500 --> 55:27.500
then it is very difficult to find its place in what we know.

55:27.500 --> 55:30.500
This is a very important task.

55:30.500 --> 55:33.500
Why, for example, with age,

55:33.500 --> 55:36.500
it becomes harder and harder to learn?

55:36.500 --> 55:39.500
The fact is that the more we live,

55:39.500 --> 55:42.500
the more experience we gain.

55:42.500 --> 55:45.500
Therefore, when we learn something new,

55:45.500 --> 55:49.500
there is a need to associate it with what we already know.

55:49.500 --> 55:54.500
We are constantly trying to find the connection between elements.

55:54.500 --> 55:57.500
This is where conservatism comes from,

55:57.500 --> 56:00.500
rigidity comes from,

56:00.500 --> 56:03.500
creativity comes from.

56:03.500 --> 56:07.500
It all depends on how we treat our cognitive map.

56:07.500 --> 56:10.500
Do we consider it given and true,

56:10.500 --> 56:13.500
because it has helped me for 40 years

56:13.500 --> 56:16.500
and there has been no cut,

56:16.500 --> 56:19.500
or am I always ready to change it

56:19.500 --> 56:22.500
because I know that the world is constantly changing

56:22.500 --> 56:25.500
and I need to be ready for this change?

56:25.500 --> 56:28.500
We cannot impose a rigid scheme on the world.

56:28.500 --> 56:31.500
Again, Kelly comes from the fact

56:31.500 --> 56:35.500
that the result of interacting with the world

56:35.500 --> 56:40.500
is the formation of one's own cognitive network.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.500
The goal of interacting with the world

56:43.500 --> 56:46.500
is to build a cognitive map of this world,

56:46.500 --> 56:49.500
that is, to learn about this world.

56:49.500 --> 56:52.500
The more I learn about this world,

56:52.500 --> 56:56.500
the more I become connected to personal constructs,

56:56.500 --> 56:59.500
the more I have connections between them,

56:59.500 --> 57:06.500
and the more changes I am ready to consider.

57:06.500 --> 57:10.500
Kelly emphasizes that all personal constructs

57:11.500 --> 57:14.500
are hypotheses,

57:14.500 --> 57:17.500
hypotheses of the person who owns them.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.500
It makes no sense to ask what constructs are correct.

57:20.500 --> 57:23.500
If these constructs are able to adapt a person

57:23.500 --> 57:26.500
to the surrounding reality,

57:26.500 --> 57:29.500
make him successful in it,

57:29.500 --> 57:32.500
achieve the goals that are before him,

57:32.500 --> 57:35.500
then his constructs are true for him

57:35.500 --> 57:38.500
and useful for him.

57:38.500 --> 57:41.500
It doesn't mean that the same constructs

57:41.500 --> 57:44.500
should be in another person's hands.

57:44.500 --> 57:47.500
If he adapts these constructs,

57:47.500 --> 57:50.500
it doesn't mean that he will interpret reality

57:50.500 --> 57:53.500
in the same way as the original person,

57:53.500 --> 57:56.500
do the same actions,

57:56.500 --> 57:59.500
make the same mistakes,

57:59.500 --> 58:02.500
and achieve the same goals.

58:02.500 --> 58:05.500
There is a lesson in life.

58:05.500 --> 58:08.500
The more the constructs are formed,

58:08.500 --> 58:11.500
the more opportunities for representation we have.

58:11.500 --> 58:14.500
Let's sum up.

58:14.500 --> 58:17.500
We have discussed the questions

58:17.500 --> 58:20.500
related to individual learning,

58:20.500 --> 58:23.500
analyzed the behavioral,

58:23.500 --> 58:26.500
cognitive-behavioral and cognitive approaches,

58:26.500 --> 58:29.500
analyzed the social theory of learning of the rotor,

58:29.500 --> 58:32.500
and the theory of the system.

58:33.500 --> 58:36.500
These are the main directions

58:36.500 --> 58:39.500
that are useful for the application

58:39.500 --> 58:42.500
of the concept in business processes,

58:42.500 --> 58:45.500
business activities,

58:45.500 --> 58:48.500
and business functioning.

58:48.500 --> 58:51.500
Let's try to see

58:51.500 --> 58:54.500
how clear it is,

58:54.500 --> 58:57.500
how useful it is,

58:57.500 --> 59:00.500
and how useful it is

59:01.500 --> 59:04.500
to apply the knowledge we have now.

59:04.500 --> 59:07.500
Now you will be offered a number of tasks

59:07.500 --> 59:10.500
that will form a certain problem.

59:10.500 --> 59:13.500
And then, during the discussion,

59:13.500 --> 59:16.500
you will try to give your answer

59:16.500 --> 59:19.500
to how you would, from your point of view,

59:19.500 --> 59:22.500
solve the situation you are offered,

59:22.500 --> 59:25.500
and how you would solve the problem

59:25.500 --> 59:28.500
that you are offered.

59:28.500 --> 59:31.500
Let's start.

59:44.500 --> 59:47.500
We have still paid special attention

59:47.500 --> 59:50.500
to individual learning

59:50.500 --> 59:53.500
and considered different approaches

59:53.500 --> 59:56.500
that are in some way

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.500
oriented to the development,

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.500
formation of learning of one person,

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.500
of one individual.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.500
Naturally, this is the task

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.500
that is very often solved

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.500
and is the most relevant,

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.500
because usually,

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.500
there is always a teacher,

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.500
there is a listener,

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.500
and it is very important

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.500
to pass on the knowledge to the listener

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.500
and then check how he has learned it,

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.500
what skills he has developed.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.500
In principle, of course,

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.500
we are primarily interested

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.500
in individual learning,

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.500
because people learn

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.500
so that they change their views

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.500
But if we only consider

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.500
individual learning,

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.500
we will again miss a very important circumstance.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.500
When it comes to organization,

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.500
of course, you can send different employees

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.500
to different educational centers,

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.500
to different providers,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.500
to different teachers,

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.500
and, accordingly, conduct individual learning

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.500
This is a rather expensive approach.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.500
You can change the situation.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.500
You can not send the organization's employees

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.500
to learn, but, on the contrary,

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.500
invite the teacher,

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.500
invite the desired specialist

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.500
to the organization itself

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.500
and organize a targeted process

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.500
of teaching most of the people

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.500
who are involved in the organization.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.500
If earlier the primary focus

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.500
and primary task of business learning

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.500
was still individual learning,

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.500
it is not for nothing that we have been

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.500
considering and doing different approaches for so long,

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.500
they simply reflect the tradition of learning.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.500
Then, somewhere starting from the middle of the 20th century,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.500
the orientation is gradually changing.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.500
Now we are talking about organizational learning.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.500
This is our next topic

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.500
that we will discuss today.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.500
Organizational learning aims to

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.500
improve the competence of the organization's employees

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.500
in order to better solve the tasks

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.500
that are before the organization,

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.500
to better implement the tasks

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.500
that are in front of the organization,

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.500
to better implement the mission of the organization,

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.500
to find other niches on the market

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.500
in terms of the promotion of goods

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.500
and services that exist in this organization.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.500
We have discussed the advantages

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.500
and disadvantages of this learning.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.500
What can we say about organizational learning?

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.500
What are the advantages and disadvantages?

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.500
Why is the concept of organizational learning

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.500
gaining more and more authority

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.500
and more and more organizations?

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.500
It is not just inviting coaches

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.500
and specialists to work with its employees,

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.500
but it is also organizing

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.500
whole corporate universities

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.500
that are already an integral part of the work with the staff

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.500
and an integral function of the Department of Education and Development.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.500
The purpose of the task is to improve the quality of the organization,

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.500
to improve the quality of the organization,

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.500
and to organize a system of continuous education

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.500
of the organization's employees.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.500
How to train new employees?

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.500
The situation is clear.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.500
If a new employee comes,

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.500
I need to introduce him

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.500
to the organizational work culture,

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.500
teach him the skills, principles,

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.500
standards, corporate behavior trends

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.500
that exist in the organization.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.500
But in addition to training new employees,

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.500
the task is often to train experienced employees,

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.500
to train managers of both middle and top levels.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.500
Why is this necessary?

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.500
The fact is that a good business organization

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.500
is an organization that never stops

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.500
at the level it has reached

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.500
and leaves its goal

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.500
and invests in further development.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.500
We have achieved certain successes in our niche.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.500
We can even be without competitors

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.500
and be clear leaders,

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.500
but business is such a thin structure

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.500
that if you stop in your development

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.500
and get drunk on your success,

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.500
it only means that soon

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.500
there will be a problem of stagnation

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.500
and you will lose your position

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.500
and the organization will have

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.500
an unenviable end.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.500
In this regard, it is worth noting

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.500
that the development of an organization

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.500
involves first of all

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.500
relying on existing conditions.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.500
This means that the organization

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.500
relies on the support of existing employees.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.500
These are people who are the bearers of ideas,

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.500
knowledge, missions, loyalty,

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.500
culture, and corporate spirit.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.500
These are people who have worked

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.500
in this organization for a long time.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.500
These are people who know

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.500
either other difficulties, successes, achievements,

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.500
or other ways to compensate for the problems

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.500
and, accordingly, these are the people

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.500
we can form a staff reserve.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.500
These are the people who can work

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.500
as mentors of new managers,

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.500
new specialists.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.500
These are the people who are the guides

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.500
and bearers of corporate history.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.500
After all, every company is proud

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.500
of the history it has.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.500
The company without history

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.500
is not a company.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.500
In this regard, organizational training

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.500
has two functions.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.500
On the one hand, it solves purely educational tasks,

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.500
teaching, forming the missing skills,

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.500
sharpening, developing the skills

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.500
that are present.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.500
On the other hand, organizational training

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.500
is a way of uniting,

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.500
developing, and further changes

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.500
in the organization that exists.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.500
It is a way of carrying out missions

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.500
to other employees of the organization,

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.500
exchanging opinions, and analyzing the situation.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.500
It is a way of building communication

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.500
and interaction with subsequent motivation,

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.500
with subsequent assessment of employees

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.500
and the tasks that the organization has.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.500
It is a way of showing the relationship

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.500
with the employee that the organization

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.500
is interested in the people who work there,

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.500
and the organization is ready to provide them

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.500
with conditions for further development.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.500
When we talked about individual training,

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.500
we considered the main criteria of individual training.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.500
Let's do the same from the point of view

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.500
of organizational training.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:44.500
The difference is that if individual training

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.500
is a traditional problem that has existed

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.500
for more than a decade,

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.500
then organizational training is a new approach

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.500
that has developed and is getting

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.500
more and more widespread in organizations.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.500
Accordingly, the problems, tasks,

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.500
and criteria that arise from the point of view

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.500
of the coverage of a particular problem

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.500
are even more controversial than the criteria

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.500
that we talked about in the case of individual training.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.500
However, our task is to get a basic idea

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.500
of the advantages and the underlying

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.500
elements of organizational training,

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.500
because organizational training is a huge investment.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.500
First, it is a means of organization,

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.500
and secondly, it is a time-consuming process.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.500
The fact is that organizational training

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:38.500
is not the kind of training that is carried out

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.500
with a three-time production.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.500
In fact, it includes a week or two months,

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.500
and most of the employees,

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.500
and the leading employees,

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.500
are disconnected from the direct activity.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.500
And again, the same dilemma arises.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.500
Where is this golden mean?

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.500
What should be the duration of this training?

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.500
What should be the return of this training?

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.500
What should be the investment in this training?

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.500
If I have now disconnected my employees

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.500
from their direct activity for a month,

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.500
how quickly will I, first of all,

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.500
recover the lost benefit that they did not receive,

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.500
and secondly, what additional profit

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.500
will it give me in order to pay off my investments?

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.500
When we talk about organizational training,

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.500
the first question that arises is

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.500
the way of its organization.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.500
What should be the concentration of participants?

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:43.500
How best to conduct organizational training?

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:46.500
Individually.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.500
That is, there are employees of the organization,

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.500
I release them from work,

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.500
and then invited specialists

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:59.500
to conduct group training.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.500
How to make groups?

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.500
And which employees should be included?

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.500
One rank, different ranks, experienced,

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.500
beginners, is it worth mixing groups?

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.500
Will everyone be interested in this group?

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.500
Again, how much will it pay off?

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.500
Will the beginners be able to take that experience

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.500
and not miss the opportunity

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.500
to get a profit?

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.500
Will experienced managers look up to the beginners

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.500
and not consider it a waste of time

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.500
when they could implement the plan

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.500
and get a profit?

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.500
If we talk about the training of the organization in general,

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.500
what levels of employees should be trained?

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.500
We cannot, even with all the desire of everyone,

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.500
train all the employees,

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.500
we live in a very tough business environment.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.500
Accordingly, if you achieve some results,

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.500
you need to continue to achieve and develop them,

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.500
because there are always those competitors

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.500
who come to us on our heels.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.500
Again, how should the training be concentrated?

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.500
How to do it optimally?

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.500
From the point of view of the organization,

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.500
how to make it more efficient?

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.500
How to do it optimally from the point of view

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.500
of the budget economy and the result?

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.500
Everything is the same as we talked about

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.500
in the case of individual training,

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.500
only there was no such task,

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.500
there we sent employees.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.500
We immediately build training within our organization.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.500
The next problem that is connected with the same problems

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.500
that were in the case of individual training

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.500
is that people working in the organization

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.500
have different experiences,

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.500
have different motivations,

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.500
have different interests, have different tendencies.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.500
So, is it worth organizing training levels?

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.500
How to distribute people at these levels?

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.500
How to make training at each level

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.500
contribute to the development of competence,

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.500
skills, knowledge, specialization,

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.500
so that they do not explain

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.500
what they already know,

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.500
what they already have,

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:23.500
but to identify and diagnose

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.500
what else to add to their skills

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.500
so that they become even more productive

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.500
and not only the company receives dividends

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.500
from this, but also the company

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.500
receives dividends from this.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.500
Not only the company receives dividends and profits from this,

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.500
but also the employees themselves receive

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.500
moral and material satisfaction from this

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.500
in the form that the company invests in their training,

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.500
which means that the company is interested in them,

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.500
interested in their results,

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.500
and, accordingly, the company does not treat them

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.500
as a kind of screw to achieve its results.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.500
The next problem of organizational training

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.500
that arises in this case

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.500
is a problem of a large number of obstacles

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.500
that arise from the point of view

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.500
of the productivity of learning.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.500
The fact is that learning

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.500
significantly implies mastering new skills,

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.500
and here a very pinching problem arises.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.500
An experienced manager who was sent to train,

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.500
who has completed this training,

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.500
can consider this training

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.500
as a dissatisfaction of the management,

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.500
its direct boss, with its results.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.500
After all, if the management is satisfied

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.500
with these results, why am I being fired

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.500
from my job so that I study for God knows what?

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.500
The problem is very serious

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.500
because in any organization we work with living people,

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:59.500
with their ambitions,

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.500
with their expectations,

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.500
with their values.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500
Remember everything we talked about

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.500
when considering the approach of Bandura

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.500
and when considering the cognitive-ambivarial approach of Rotter.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.500
People have motives,

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.500
people have aspirations,

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.500
people have clings, people have ambitions,

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.500
and it may turn out that the management

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.500
organizes this process with the best motivations,

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.500
with the best expectations,

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.500
and the employees perceive it

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.500
as distrust of themselves.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.500
Moreover, they even begin to look for new jobs

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.500
where they seem to be in demand.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:47.500
If we train what is called star managers

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.500
who are successful in their field,

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.500
then there is a problem of losing valuable personnel.

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:57.500
How to motivate people to study?

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.500
How to justify and how to offer

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.500
these or those forms of organizational interaction

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.500
so that people do not perceive it

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:09.500
as a dissatisfaction

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.500
or as a meaningless waste of time?

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.500
And, of course, the next problem

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.500
that arises is related to the fact

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.500
that organizational training is a very serious interference

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.500
in the functioning of the organization.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.500
It is a very serious interference

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.500
in the organizational behavior

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.500
that we have discussed.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.500
The fact is that there are certain relationships,

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.500
certain communications,

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.500
certain norms, certain traditions

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.500
that are considered to be self-evident in the organization.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:53.500
There is no question of why they are like that.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.500
It is accepted.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.500
And suddenly, when organizational training is going on,

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.500
it becomes clear that it is not necessary

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.500
to talk about it.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.500
Qualitative training is the training

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.500
that makes managers think about the prospects

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.500
of the development of their organization.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.500
We will talk about this in more detail

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.500
in the next lecture.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.500
So, the question arises,

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.500
why do we do it this way and not the other way around?

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.500
A lot of negative things

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.500
that exist in the organization

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.500
begin to be identified and recorded.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.500
And there is a negative in any organization

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.500
simply because if there are a lot of people

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.500
working in the organization,

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.500
the employees are always dissatisfied with something.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.500
Either with the salary,

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.500
or with the motivation, or with the relations.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.500
And in this regard,

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.500
any interference

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.500
brings very dangerous and fraught moments.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.500
And then the question arises,

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.500
the interference will still be there.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.500
How to make it effective

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.500
and how to reduce it to zero?

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.500
All possible difficulties will arise.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.500
They will arise for sure.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.500
These are the main problems

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.500
that arise in the concept of organizational training.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.500
If we read the literature

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.500
that is being published on this topic,

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.500
there are a lot of smaller problems.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.500
There are specific examples

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.500
of the difficulties that arise in organizational training.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.500
In this regard,

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.500
the question arises,

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.500
what arguments prevail

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.500
for the concept of organizational training?

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.500
If this form of training

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.500
becomes more and more popular

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:03.500
in foreign companies,

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.500
it is the best indicator

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.500
that the advantages that are obtained

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.500
are a significant argument

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.500
for the transition

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.500
from individual training

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.500
to organizational training.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.500
But this is a qualitative change

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.500
that arises in relation to the organization,

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.500
to the staff,

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.500
and to the organization of all the types of training

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.500
that exist now.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:39.500
What types of organizational training exist?

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.500
Types of training

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.500
differ in the goals and forms

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.500
that can be identified.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.500
Of course, these types of training

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.500
are closely interlinked with individual training,

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.500
but when it comes to individual training,

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.500
to a large extent,

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.500
it is connected with the individual features

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.500
of one person, one employee,

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.500
one manager who works in the organization.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.500
When we talk about organizational training,

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.500
there are any difficulties,

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.500
misunderstandings that arise

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.500
that are associated

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.500
with the problems arising in any organization.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.500
Usually, there are three types of training.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.500
The first type of training is adaptive training.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.500
Its goal is to develop abilities,

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.500
develop skills,

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.500
develop competencies,

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.500
understand new situations

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.500
that may arise in business.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.500
This is a preliminary,

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.500
prognostic training.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.500
Business is constantly developing forward.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.500
It is a constant change,

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.500
and you need to be ready for these changes.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.500
If you are stagnant,

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.500
then, in fact,

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.500
you are talking about a very unfavorable perspective.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.500
As for adaptive training,

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:15.500
from one point of view,

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.500
this is perhaps the most familiar form of training,

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.500
because we adapt each employee

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.500
to a new place,

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.500
to a new purpose,

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.500
to a new function,

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.500
to a new plan.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.500
If we change some fundamental points,

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.500
enter a new market sphere,

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.500
strive to change the strategic conditions

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.500
of the organization's development,

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.500
we must prepare and adapt the organization's staff

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.500
to the new visions that are introduced in the organization.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.500
In fact, adaptive training

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.500
is a necessary training

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.500
to successfully solve

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.500
and meet new requirements

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.500
that may arise.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:09.500
Another type of training is generative training.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.500
As for generative training,

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.500
in fact,

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.500
it is a training that requires

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.500
the development of the ability to look at your organization in a new way,

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.500
its prospects,

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.500
its place on the market,

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.500
its relationship with competitors.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.500
In fact, it is a creative training.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.500
In this case,

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.500
it is about changing some of the organizational systems,

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.500
some basic principles,

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.500
management systems.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.500
This type of training, of course,

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.500
involves a preliminary,

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.500
very deep analysis.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.500
Moreover, this analysis is not carried out

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.500
in a week, month, quarter.

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:03.500
It is a long-term, long-term,

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.500
and prospective analysis,

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.500
when certain approaches are found,

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.500
and some definitions are found,

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:15.500
and in the end we come up

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.500
with the whole set of views,

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.500
theological views,

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.500
relationship with a certain community

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.500
and that is the type of training

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.500
where, in particular,

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:36.500
from years of being active or active

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.500
And finally, the third type of training

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.500
is training in the workplace.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.500
And in this case,

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:49.500
it is not only about adaptation and training of newbies,

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.500
that is, new employees who came to work

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.500
and who are put in positions.

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.500
Recently, training in the workplace

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.500
has become widespread from the point of view

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.500
of the development of the mentorship system.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.500
These are employees who have worked for a long time

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.500
in the company, in the enterprise.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:13.500
And, accordingly, these employees are,

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.500
in fact, living bearers,

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.500
living implementers of the history of the organization,

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.500
the tradition of the organization.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.500
They have colossal experience,

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.500
they have the competencies that this organization needs,

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.500
and it is thanks to their competencies

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.500
that this organization has achieved

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.500
the achievements that it has been given.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.500
Accordingly, these employees can pass

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.500
their truly invaluable,

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.500
here without any quotes,

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.500
experience to new employees.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.500
Simply because they know best

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.500
what to pay attention to,

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:58.500
what to avoid,

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.500
what to do in case of emergency or other dangers.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:04.500
As for mentorship,

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.500
it is precisely organizational training,

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.500
because each organization has its own problems,

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.500
each organization has its own tasks,

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.500
and only people who have worked

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:19.500
in the organization for a long time,

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.500
only people who have seen

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.500
the rise of the organization,

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:28.500
and who know the difficulties and difficulties,

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.500
can prevent negative actions

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.500
and develop and contribute

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.500
to those competencies that will help

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.500
solve the tasks facing this organization.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.500
Business tasks.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.500
In this regard,

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.500
since the 1980s,

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.500
the organization has been developing

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.500
and developing its own concept.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:58.500
Many people are engaged in this topic today,

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.500
but the iconic figure in this regard

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.500
is Chris Argyris,

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.500
because it was Chris Argyris

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:10.500
who wrote the book

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.500
about the learning organization,

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:16.500
which, by the way,

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.500
was translated into English

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.500
and you can find it in the list of literature

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.500
that is attached to you.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.500
And it was Chris Argyris

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:31.500
who drew attention to all those aspects

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:34.500
that we are talking about now

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.500
from the point of view of the learning organization

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.500
and the difference between individual learning

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.500
and learning organization.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.500
Argyris came from the fact

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.500
that the fundamental value

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:52.500
has a reverse connection.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.500
We do not need education for the sake of education.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.500
As often happens,

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.500
there are certain standards

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.500
that for three or five years

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.500
it is necessary to undergo retraining,

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.500
level of improvement, qualifications, etc.

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.500
Moreover, this process is very often

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.500
connected with the fact

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.500
that you receive a diploma

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.500
without going to these classes

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.500
and, in fact, this is a vacation for you.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.500
We do not need such education.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.500
Argyris, since he was a representative

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.500
of a foreign business,

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:37.500
comes from the fact

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.500
that if an organization wants to develop,

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.500
wants to achieve new successful achievements,

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.500
and invests funds in education,

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.500
then this education should be profitable,

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.500
there should be investments.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.500
In this regard,

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.500
he addresses the concept of reverse connection.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.500
That is, there are certain goals

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.500
that the organization,

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.500
the leadership of the organization wants to achieve.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.500
There are certain actions

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.500
that it takes to achieve these goals.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.500
One of these actions is to build education in the organization.

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.500
Consequently,

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.500
these actions lead to some consequences,

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.500
some results.

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.500
But then you need to look

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.500
whether the results that the organization wants to get

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.500
correspond to what has really been achieved.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.500
If it corresponds,

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.500
then we can admit that the organizational training was successful.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500
But this happens, unfortunately,

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.500
far from always.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.500
Sometimes it turns out

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.500
that the results that the organization has received

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.500
lead to a discrepancy

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.500
with the original criteria

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.500
of the result that it would like to get.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.500
In this regard,

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:10.500
the first reverse connection or so-called

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.500
ordinary loop of reverse connection arises.

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.500
As for English,

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.500
here it is more likely to translate as ordinary,

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.500
that is, a simple reverse connection.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.500
We see that the desired result has not been achieved.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.500
We need education

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.500
that contributes to the implementation

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.500
and solution of new tasks in front of the organization.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.500
Accordingly, we need to invest funds

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:41.500
to ensure such a process of improvement

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.500
that will allow the organization's employees

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.500
to solve the tasks in front of them.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.500
These are everyday tasks.

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.500
This is very important.

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:56.500
These are tasks that arise in front of them constantly,

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:59.500
that arise every day,

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.500
and that we solve daily.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.500
This is an ordinary loop of learning,

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:09.500
an ordinary loop of reverse connection.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.500
But!

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:15.500
And this is the loop

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.500
that is traditionally present

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.500
in the learning process,

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.500
which traditionally drew attention

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.500
to the concept of learning.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.500
But!

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.500
Perhaps another situation.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.500
We have some criteria for the final result.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.500
The organization is learning,

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.500
some consequences appear,

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.500
but we see that the consequences

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.500
do not correspond to what we want.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.500
We can go the old way,

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.500
that is, use the usual loop of double connection

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.500
and look for those specialists,

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.500
those providers who will teach

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.500
the momentary solution of the tasks that arise

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.500
and, accordingly,

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.500
will allow to solve the problems that arise.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.500
But!

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:17.500
Perhaps another approach.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.500
There is a discrepancy

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:23.500
between the criteria for the result

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.500
and the result that is obtained.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.500
Then the question arises.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.500
If this discrepancy

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.500
persistently continues to be realized

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.500
and persistently does not disappear,

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.500
maybe it is not in the competence of the employees,

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.500
maybe it is that

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.500
the organization structure itself

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.500
or the basic principles

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.500
of this organization are not in line with the criteria.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:58.500
That is, it is necessary to set the organization

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.500
on the path of change.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.500
According to Adgeris,

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.500
this is a double loop of feedback

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.500
or a complex feedback.

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.500
The unitary loop, the usual loop,

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.500
showed that the training is not successful.

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:19.500
Attempts to achieve the results of the training

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:22.500
do not lead to the desired results.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.500
Then a problem arises.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.500
Or maybe the organization has already exhausted

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.500
its basic principles,

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.500
its structure,

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:37.500
and it needs root transformations.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.500
In this case,

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:43.500
we should talk about a complex

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.500
generative feedback

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.500
or a complex generative feedback.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.500
Adgeris gives an interesting example

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.500
with a calorifer.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.500
If we have a calorifer,

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.500
a heater,

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:04.500
and our task is to maintain

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.500
a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.500
in the room or in the office.

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.500
We set this temperature on the calorifer

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.500
and it starts to work.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.500
When the temperature reaches 20 degrees,

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.500
it turns off and, accordingly,

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:25.500
stops working and consumes energy.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.500
When the temperature drops below 20 degrees,

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.500
it turns on and heats up

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.500
to 20 degrees of air temperature again.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.500
This is what, according to Adgeris,

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.500
is a regular loop of feedback.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.500
This is what is done

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.500
in all existing heating devices

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.500
that exist today.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.500
They heat up the temperature

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.500
to a certain level that we set.

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:58.500
After that, they turn off,

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:01.500
save electricity.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:04.500
When the temperature in the room

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.500
drops again, they turn on.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.500
On the other hand,

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:13.500
there may be another task.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.500
Should we turn on the calorifer?

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.500
Maybe we should improve

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.500
the window frames?

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.500
Maybe we should put in

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.500
other window frames?

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:31.500
Maybe there are other ways

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:34.500
to maintain a temperature of 20 degrees?

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:37.500
In this case, the question is,

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.500
do we really need this calorifer

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.500
that is able to heat up

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:46.500
the temperature to 20 degrees?

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:49.500
Maybe we need some basic transformations?

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.500
This is a loop of double communication.

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.500
When we don't just solve the problem

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.500
of increasing the temperature,

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.500
we turn on the calorifer,

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.500
and we turn off the calorifer.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.500
If we want to optimize the structure of the work,

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:10.500
maybe we should buy two calorifers?

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.500
Maybe we should build partitions

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:16.500
inside the office

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.500
to improve the heating situation?

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:22.500
Maybe we should install thermal insulation materials?

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.500
The basic principles change here.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.500
The task is to create comfortable working conditions.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.500
Maybe we should create

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.500
a loop of complex or generative

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:37.500
conditions?

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:40.500
This is a loop of complex or generative

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:43.500
conditions.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:46.500
From the point of view of Argyris,

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.500
organizational learning should

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.500
move to building complex

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.500
or double loops

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.500
according to its terminology.

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.500
I want to draw your attention to the fact

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:04.500
that a single loop is a regular learning.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.500
It is the same as an individual learning.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:10.500
I come to learn something,

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:13.500
then I pass the exams based on these exams,

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.500
I get a certain qualification,

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.500
I return to my workplace,

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.500
and then it turns out whether my new skills

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.500
are good or not.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:28.500
The same is with an organization.

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:31.500
The organization starts to get

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.500
the desired results.

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.500
The loop of double communication

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.500
involves systemic changes.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.500
It is a systematic approach.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:46.500
It is what is well-known

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.500
in the business news

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.500
that we need a systematic approach.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.500
We should consider an organization

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.500
as a system,

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:01.500
which is included in the system of other organizations,

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.500
which is included in the system of business,

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.500
which is included in the system of the market.

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.500
This is the interaction of systems.

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.500
An organization that learns is a beautiful organization

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:16.500
that exists in this system

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.500
and is able to change

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.500
even if it is necessary to change its basic principles

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.500
to get the desired result.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:28.500
The concept of Argyris has received

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.500
a wide spread in the business environment.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:34.500
a wide spread in the business environment.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:37.500
More and more supporters

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.500
are becoming

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.500
to build training in learning organizations.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:46.500
They have received the name

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.500
of learning organization.

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:52.500
As for learning organizations,

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:55.500
there are four main problems.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.500
There are four main problems.

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.500
I would like to draw your attention

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.500
to the fact that the idea of Argyris

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.500
is almost modern.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.500
It is the 1980s.

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:13.500
Argyris is constantly

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.500
modernizing its proposals.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:19.500
There are already followers and opponents.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:22.500
It is one of the possible systems.

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.500
It is one of the possible approaches to learning.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:28.500
I don't want to say that this is how you should build training.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:31.500
But you need to know the trends

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.500
that exist in the modern business environment.

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:37.500
that exist in the modern business environment.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.500
The first problem is the organization

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:43.500
that pays attention to the changes

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.500
that are happening in it.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:49.500
The organization that pays attention to the changes

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:52.500
that are happening in it.

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:55.500
What policy is implemented in these organizations?

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.500
What policy is implemented in these organizations?

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.500
The first and main task

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:04.500
is the desire to develop

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.500
the employees.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:10.500
The first and main task

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:13.500
is the desire to develop the employees.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:16.500
The organization is an abstraction.

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.500
The organization is a component of people

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.500
and relationships between people.

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:25.500
If we want to change the organization,

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:28.500
we must change people's worldview,

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.500
change their cognitive structures,

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.500
change their motivation,

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:37.500
change the models

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.500
from which they model their behavior.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.500
change their motivation,

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:46.500
change the models

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:49.500
from which they model their behavior.

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:52.500
The second approach

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.500
is the development of large-scale learning programs.

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:58.500
The second approach

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.500
is the development of large-scale learning programs.

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:04.500
The third approach

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.500
is the development of adaptation schools

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.500
and assessment centers.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.500
In fact, it is the implementation of a system

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.500
of working with staff,

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:19.500
training and development of staff,

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.500
assessment and motivation of staff.

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.500
Because in learning organizations

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.500
we have to develop a strategic program.

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:31.500
It is not a program for a year or two.

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.500
It is a program for 3-5 years.

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.500
It is a program with business planning,

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.500
with calculations, financial investments

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.500
and the return expected.

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.500
The third point

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:49.500
that is usually considered in learning organizations

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.500
is the development of key skills and competencies

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.500
that are necessary for successful organization development.

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.500
that are necessary for successful organization development.

01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.500
It is a very important aspect.

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.500
It is necessary not only for the organization

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.500
to be successful now,

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.500
if it exists and has the means for training,

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:13.500
it means that it is still occupying its niche.

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.500
It is about the admiration of those skills,

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:19.500
of those competencies

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:22.500
that the organization may need

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.500
in order to reflect,

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:28.500
to respond to market challenges,

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.500
to be able to outrun competitors

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.500
and to hold the won positions.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.500
and to hold the won positions.

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:44.500
The fourth,

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.500
the last aspect,

01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:51.500
is the demand for new acquired skills.

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:54.500
is the demand for new acquired skills.

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:57.500
We are back to the human.

01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:00.500
People usually prefer to use

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:03.500
what they are already familiar with.

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:06.500
And in this regard,

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:09.500
they get a lot of new knowledge.

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:12.500
But here the question arises,

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.500
why this novelty?

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.500
Tomorrow, from Monday,

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.500
I will start to introduce new approaches.

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:25.500
tomorrow, from Monday,

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.500
I will start to introduce new approaches.

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:31.500
But for now, let them work as usual.

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.500
But for now, let them work as usual.

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.500
They have come to the same excuses

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:40.500
that we talked about when discussing Bandura,

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:43.500
when discussing the concept of the Rotary,

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:46.500
that is, the organization that is not only

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.500
the one that builds the training program,

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.500
that develops each individual,

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.500
that reveals the promising skills and competencies,

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.500
that reveals the promising skills and competencies,

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.500
but this is the organization

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.500
that fundamentally creates conditions

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.500
where these skills should be developed.

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.500
where these skills should be developed.

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:13.500
This is not always an easy step,

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:16.500
because the transition from one strategy of development

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:19.500
to another strategy of development

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:22.500
can be accompanied by a temporary decrease in the indicators,

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:25.500
can be accompanied by a temporary decrease in the indicators,

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:28.500
a temporary retreat from the existing positions.

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:31.500
A temporary retreat from the existing positions.

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:34.500
You have to be ready for this.

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.500
There is nothing wrong with this.

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.500
If the situation is well analyzed,

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:43.500
if the situation is well calculated,

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:46.500
and if there is a strategy of development,

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.500
the learning organization is the one

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:52.500
that has a strategy of the future.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:55.500
This is the organization that is not afraid

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.500
of the changes that will come.

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.500
These are the general approaches

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:04.500
that have been formed now,

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:07.500
that are used today

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.500
in terms of organizational learning.

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:13.500
Naturally, this is a new direction.

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.500
Naturally, this is a new direction.

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.500
We needed much less time

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:22.500
compared to individual training

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:25.500
to understand this.

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:28.500
Let's see how much the material,

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.500
the knowledge that we have,

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:34.500
the knowledge that we have,

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.500
may be useful to you.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.500
Let's do the tasks

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.500
that we will offer you now.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:46.500
You will discuss the solutions

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:49.500
to the problem situations

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.500
that we have discussed

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:55.500
and the suggestions that you can give

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:58.500
to solve the cases that will be offered to you.

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.500
So, dear colleagues,

01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:07.500
during our today's lesson

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:10.500
we have discussed the problems

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:13.500
of individual and organizational learning.

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.500
We have analyzed the approaches

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.500
to individual learning,

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.500
the behavioral, cognitive-behavioral,

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:25.500
and cognitive approaches.

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.500
We have considered the learning

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:31.500
of the approach of Chris Argyris

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.500
and the problems and tendencies

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.500
that are associated with the learning

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.500
of people in organizations.

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:43.500
We have analyzed the connections

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:46.500
between individual learning

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:49.500
and the learning of organizations

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:52.500
and have outlined the prospects

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.500
of learning development

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:58.500
and the strategic plan of organization development.

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.500
Because the learning of an organization

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.500
is built on this plan.

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.500
The tasks that we have discussed

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.500
give a general idea

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.500
of how to solve the problem

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:16.500
of learning in an organization.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.500
You can get answers to specific questions

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:22.500
in the literature that is offered to you.
