00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Debit debt is rather a forced state in which the enterprise is, only because it exists in specific conditions of the market.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
It cannot but have a debit debt.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
But it is not interested in it in excessive magnitude.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
It is not interested in it at all.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
But it cannot have it below the required magnitude for business to exist.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
That is why it is interested in a decrease, but not below the minimum required magnitude.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
But on the other hand, as we can see from this formula, the enterprise is extremely interested in increasing the creditors' interest.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Of course, living in business at someone else's expense is simply amazing.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
Everyone is lending you money, and you are developing without even using your own money.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
It would seem that this is an ideal dream.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
But in fact, the use of creditors' interest again has its limits.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Firstly, you are being credited only because you are in the market conditions.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
You are not being credited for charity.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
You are being credited because if you are not given a credit, you will take it from another enterprise.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
It is a competition.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
That is why you are being credited.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
But on the other hand, you are not being credited for charity.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
That is why creditors' interest always exists in some limits.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
On the other hand, creditors' interest is a debt that you have to pay back anyway.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
That is why it is impossible to increase creditors' interest infinitely.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
You have to pay it back.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
Moreover, creditors' interest, as we know, has a hidden payment for these money.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
You still get it for free.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
It is just hidden in the price, but there is a payment for it.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
On the other hand, creditors' interest has to be paid back.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
It is determined by business ethics.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
You are given it until you pay it back.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
As soon as you refuse to pay it back, no one will give it to you.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Moreover, you will be demanded to pay it back.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
By all the truths and untruths.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
That is why creditors' interest is such a value that is within the business ethics.

02:38.000 --> 02:47.000
You are given it, you pay it back, and all parties are satisfied with the normal business process.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
The main thing is not to get lost in this optimal process and to be within it.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
During the production itself, a number of factors influence the current financial needs.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
First of all, it is the duration of the production and export cycle.

03:05.000 --> 03:18.000
Imagine that the longer the production process, the more money is in the form of assets.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
The longer the cycle, the more money.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
And the longer the export cycle, the longer the company can't sell its products,

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
the more the products are kept in the warehouse.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
All this requires additional financial resources, which are concentrated in this form.

03:40.000 --> 03:49.000
That is why the duration of the production cycle and the duration of the household cycle are not indifferent to the businessman.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
But if the duration of the export cycle depends on the production process itself,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
and if you can't do it faster than the production process,

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
then the businessman can influence the rhythmicality of the production.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
He shouldn't allow these failures.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
The production process should be minimized in time.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Then the funds that will be frozen in the production process will be minimal.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
The household cycle is also very important for the businessman.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
On the one hand, the businessman is interested in selling the product as soon as possible.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
Of course, why keep the product frozen if the market is ready to take it?

04:38.000 --> 04:47.000
But the household cycle is also a very important part of the business.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
If you don't have any ready-made products in the warehouse,

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
you have an opportunity to refuse a partner who would like to purchase the product.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
He comes and says, I want to buy from you.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
You say, no, we've sold everything, there's nothing.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
He turns around and leaves to your competitor.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
And you lose a partner who you could have used to produce a lot of your products.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
And the next time you have a product, but there's no one to sell it to.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
That's why you should have as many ready-made products in the warehouse

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
so that you don't have to say no to anyone.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
And so that everyone who approached you for ready-made products,

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
would say with a smile, yes, we're happy to see you, we're ready to offer you our products.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Then the number of business partners who will purchase it from you will increase,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
or at least not decrease, which is very important for the business.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
That's why in the household cycle, a certain part of the goods,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
a certain part of the finances are concentrated there,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
and you can't get anywhere without it.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
This is the market, this is the life of the business.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
But the current financial needs are also influenced by the pace of production growth.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
It has a very specific effect.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
The higher the pace of production growth, the more you produce products,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
the more you need to invest in the production of the household cycle,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
providing these growth rates.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Moreover, you will also need the means,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
but they are not reversible,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
they are the main means that are aimed at the technical rearmament of your production.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
In order to ensure faster growth of production,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
you need to use more and more modern means of production.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Thus, if you want to have higher pace of growth,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
if your business is expanding,

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
you need to invest more and more money in the production process,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
in the household cycle,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
which requires additional finances.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
The seasonality of production is also influenced.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
The thing is that modern business is in many ways seasonal.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
The easiest example is agriculture.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
The harvest is a seasonal factor.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
The harvest is not planted and harvested every year.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
The season is a year,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
and during this year the harvest is planted,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
the harvest is harvested,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
it is stored, processed, and so on.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
But not only agriculture.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
There is also seasonality, which is related to the seasons.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
The seasons are very dependent on the season.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
In winter, construction work is much more difficult than in summer.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
That's why builders always want to do construction work in summer.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Another thing is that it is not always possible.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
As soon as spring and summer come,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
the money ends.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Unfortunately, this is the practice.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
When builders want to build, they have nothing to build.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
And in winter, when everything is over,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
money appears.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
To avoid this, it is necessary to plan correctly.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
In summer and spring, in autumn,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
the largest amount of money is left,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
and this is a seasonal factor to use in construction.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Probably, in other industries,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
you can say the same,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
but in construction,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
the whole clothing is seasonal.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Seasonality also includes the production of clothing.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
All clothing is seasonal.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
There is clothing for summer, for winter.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Any company that produces clothing

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
is adjusted in such a way

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
to produce it for that season,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
when it will be used as needed.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Seasonality leads to the fact

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
that the enterprise works unevenly for a year.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Not because it works badly,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
but because of the production cycle.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Accordingly, with uneven work,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
in different periods of the year,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
the enterprise needs more or less

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
turnover for work.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
The enterprise must adjust its turnover

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
to have enough turnover for the season.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Moreover, seasonality is not only in production,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
but also in implementation.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
For example, builders,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
and those who buy apartments,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
know that there is a season of buying apartments.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
There is a period of vacations,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
when the sale of a new apartment is frozen.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
And after leaving the vacation,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
the sale of a new apartment is activated.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
And a significant number of apartments

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
are purchased.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Thus, the implementation of the enterprise

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
is not only in production,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
but also in implementation.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
In addition to the production of the enterprise,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
there is also a supply.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
The supply itself can have a production character,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
but it is not a product.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
And when the raw material is produced unevenly

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
all year round,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
but only in certain periods,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
it is necessary to buy it

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
and store it.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
The enterprise is forced to buy

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
the raw material in season,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
to have special capacity for storing it,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
and to use it normally in the production process.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Thus, the enterprise has a break-through

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
of liquidity of financial resources.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And the enterprise must,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
in advance,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
foresee the break-through of liquidity,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
and foresee the sources

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
through which

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
these break-throughs of liquidity will be covered.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
The state of the industry

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
also affects the current financial needs.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Our enterprise, which we are considering,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
is not located on a residential island.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
It is surrounded by the same enterprises

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
as the industry,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
its competitors,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
which, in turn,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
try to seize the market share

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
and track the competitors.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And not to lose to them in the competition.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Lack of turnover

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
leads to the fact that the enterprise

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
is out of competition.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
The competitors have turnover

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
and can offer the product to the consumer.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And if we do not have this money

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
and we will not be able to normalize the product

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
the state of the competitive environment

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
and the state of the industry

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
plays a very important role.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
The industry is not only a competitive environment.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
It is also what we produce,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
what is popular as a commodity.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
There are fashionable goods.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
If we do not monitor the state of the market,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
the state of fashion,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
the state of the production,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
it may turn out that soon

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
this product will not be needed.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
It will simply cease to be in demand.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
The enterprise must monitor the state of the market,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
the needs of the market

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
and adjust in time to produce only the product

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
that the market needs.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
In addition to the above factors,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
the enterprise must also

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
meet the requirements of the added value standard.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
The enterprise must meet the requirements

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
of the added value standard.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
It is clear that each enterprise

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
would like to earn as much as possible

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
and have as much as possible

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
of the added value standard.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
But there are two ends of the stick.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
The enterprise should try to sell the goods

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
at the highest price possible.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
At the same cost,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
this, of course, provides a high standard

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
of the added value.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
But a higher price for the goods

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
that the enterprise produces

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
requires additional actions from the enterprise.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
First, it is not enough to increase the price

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
of the goods.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
One of the options is to move to a state of monopoly.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
If you are a monopolist,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
then you increase the price

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
and it is easier to implement it.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
If you are a monopolist

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
and you have three to five main competitors,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
you have to enter into a conspiracy

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
to become a monopolist through a conspiracy

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
and to achieve a higher standard of the added value.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
But the elasticity of the goods

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
also plays a role here.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Remember our first lecture

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
where we talked about the elasticity of the goods?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
If the goods are not elastic,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
for example, salt,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
then the price increase

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
does not affect the ability to implement the goods.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
You sell the same amount of goods as before,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
but at a higher price.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And the standard of the added value increases

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
and the enterprise feels euphoria

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
from getting additional profit.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
But if your goods are elastic

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
and more and more high-elastic,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
then the price increase is not a good condition.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
The thing is that if you are not a monopolist

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
and you are in a state of conspiracy,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
then the price increase leads to the fact

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
that the consumers stop buying the goods

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
and start buying the goods from your competitors

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
who did not raise the price.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
The sale of elastic goods

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
in order to get more profit,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
as you remember,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
should not increase the price,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
but should decrease the price.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
When we talk about the standard of the added value,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
we are talking about the price increase.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
The price increase is good for non-elastic goods

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
or for elastic goods

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
that are still produced by monopolists

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
or monopolists.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Then, due to these economic forms,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
the goods become non-elastic

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
and the price increases.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
And if you are not a very large enterprise

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
and you cannot be a monopolist or a monopolist,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
but you are in a competitive environment,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
you need to remember

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
that the price increase

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
is not the only way

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
to get profit from the business.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
You can get profit from the business

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
by reducing the price,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
reducing the standard of the added value,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
but increasing the volume of the produced goods.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
And the total profit you get

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
from the production of the standard of the added value

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
for the number of produced goods will increase.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
So, if you are not an oligopolist

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
and not a monopolist,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
do not despair.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
You can reduce the price

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
and then you will live perfectly

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
without increasing the price.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
For the coverage of the current financial needs

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
that we have just talked about,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
enterprises need financial resources.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Where do enterprises get the financial resources

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
to realize their needs?

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
We have already said that the best is their own financial resources.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
But if they are not enough,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
and if they do not have enough credit

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
that is generated by the business partners

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
to provide them with the goods,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
then the enterprise, as we remember,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
turns to the financial market

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
and gets the financial resources

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
from the market

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
in the form of a loan or a bank loan.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
I repeat,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
a loan is the obtaining of financial resources

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
from the same business partners as you,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
and a loan is the obtaining of financial resources

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
from the banks.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
We have already talked about this,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
but we have repeated it again.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
So, a loan or a bank loan

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
is a way to cover the current financial needs.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
We are talking about short-term financial needs,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
so we are talking about short-term loans

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
or short-term bank loans.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
In addition to these,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
there is an opportunity to issue a VEXEL.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
And these enterprises often use it.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
VEXEL is a very convenient form of short-term financing.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
The thing is that you issue VEXEL yourself.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
You do not have to go to any financial institution

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
to issue a VEXEL.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
There is a law that regulates the content of VEXEL,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
which should be indicated in VEXEL.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
The form of VEXEL is determined by you,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
so that you can write VEXEL

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
on a clean piece of paper.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Only if everything that is written in VEXEL

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
meets the requirements of the law.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
It is easy to issue a VEXEL,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
but the most important thing in VEXEL is that it is accepted.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
When instead of money you are allowed to take VEXEL,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
you are using the reputation of a reliable business partner.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
You are trusted and instead of money you are allowed to take VEXEL.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
VEXEL is an urgent payment

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
that you promise to return

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
after some time,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
which is described in VEXEL.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
You will be returned VEXEL,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
and you will be returned money

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
with the interest rate that is described in VEXEL.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
If you are a reliable business partner,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
if you are trusted,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
then they will agree to take your VEXEL.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
If you are not reliable in business,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
then you will not be able to use

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
such a form of attracting financial funds

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
as issuing VEXELs.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
In addition to VEXELs,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
you can use factoring.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
This is a new form of financing,

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
a new one in the Russian market.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
It does not mean that it is never used in the world.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Factoring has been known for a long time in the world,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
and it is used in all countries,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
but in the Russian market it is a young form.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
And in terms of time,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
not all enterprises that are even

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
worthy of using factoring, use it.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Moreover, not everyone knows about factoring,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
so when we talk about it now,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
it is very important,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
because factoring has a serious future.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
What is factoring?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
I must say, so that you can clearly imagine

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
when to turn to it.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Factoring is used by production enterprises,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
which produce the product

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
and then transfer it to the consumer

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
in the form of a commodity loan.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
But the enterprise cannot expand the commodity loan

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
to infinity,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
because it has a fixed limited amount of money.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
It can give a commodity loan

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
no more than it can give,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
and then it will stop.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
And if it wants to expand its production,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
it needs to increase the quantity of the commodity

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
that is provided in the form of a commodity loan.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
It needs money for that.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And if all the lighter forms

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
that we have been talking about today are already used,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
and they cannot be used anymore,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
then we should remember about factoring.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Factoring is not a loan.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
It is not provided by banks,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
although banks sometimes participate in it,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
but by special factoring companies

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
that are created with banks

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
and provide factoring services.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
The essence of factoring services is that

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
the production enterprise unloads the commodity,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
provides a commodity loan,

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
and the factory company

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
transfers the documents of the commodity unloading.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
And the factory company exchanges

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
the debt that the enterprise has

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
for the money

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
that is needed to cover the debt.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Thus, the enterprise,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
in fact,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
gets the money

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
that it can use for further production.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
And it does not need to wait

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
for the return of the money from the trading partners.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
The trading partners can get a very long term loan,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
and the enterprise gets the money right away

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
on the fact of the realization of the commodity.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
It is very convenient.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
But all the convenience

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
should be assumed,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
that the enterprise gets the money

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
from the factoring company,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
and it should pay the factoring company

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
the same way as you pay the bank

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
a percentage of its use of credit funds.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
And the factoring company

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
should pay a certain fee for the services it provides.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
So, if you get financial funds

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
either from the bank

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
or from the factoring company,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
all these funds are not free.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
There is a certain fee for them.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
And the bank percentage is even less than the factoring one.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Therefore, the enterprise always takes the bank loan

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
earlier than the factoring one.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
The factoring is the use of money.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
The bank provides the factoring company

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
with money,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
and the factoring company provides it to you.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Thus, you pay the bank a percentage

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
and the factoring company a percentage

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
for the factoring company's participation in the operation.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Therefore, the factoring funds are more expensive

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
than the bank funds.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
But we have already said that we have taken all the bank funds

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
that we could get.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
The banks don't give us any more.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
We take the factoring company.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
We take the more expensive funds

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
for not having the cheaper ones.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
But we have to pay for these funds anyway.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
The question arises,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
is any enterprise profitable

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
with the credit funds or the factoring funds?

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
The answer is simple, but we have to fixate it.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
The fact is that there is a profitability of the business.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Any businessman gets a profit.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
There is a norm of the profit he gets.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
And the profitability of the business

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
should be higher than the percentage

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
that you pay for the factoring funds.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
In this case, if this condition is fulfilled,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
it is profitable for you to use the factoring funds.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Therefore, no matter how much you take the factoring funds,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
the result will be profitable for you.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
This delta that arises between the profitability of your business

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
and the percentage that you have to pay for the factoring funds

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
is the result of your financial operations.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
And it brings additional income to the company.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
But if a businessman has a business

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
that is less profitable than the percentage

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
that you have to pay to the bank

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
and the percentage that you have to pay to the bank

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
and the percentage that you have to pay to the bank

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
or the factoring company,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
it is not profitable to use these funds.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Because you will pay more money for these funds

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
than you will get from using them in the business.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Therefore, before you go to the bank

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
or the factoring company,

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
you should look at the profitability of your business

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
and compare it with the percentage that you have to pay

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
for using the factoring funds.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
And, accordingly, make the appropriate decision.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
And at the end of our first question,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
I would like to make one small but very interesting remark.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
For small and medium-sized enterprises,

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
there is a unique feature.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
It is so unique that it is a sin not to know about it.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
The fact is that these enterprises can build

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
the system of current financial needs

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
in such a way that it has a negative meaning.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
That is, to have more money flows

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
than the need in these financial funds.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Do you remember in our formula we said

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
that the current need is determined

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
by the need for reserves and debt.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
And the minus of the reserve and credit debt.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Thus, if the credit debt exceeds the debt and reserves,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
you get into a unique situation

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
when you, due to the business,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
due to the situation in the market,

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
have borrowed more money

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
than you need to borrow from others.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Can you imagine?

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
You are in a situation when you work

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
exclusively with borrowed funds.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
And you did not specially borrow them.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
This is the situation in the market.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
You work in a situation when you are credited.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
And you are credited constantly.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
For an indefinite period.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
And in this situation you can be in for a very long time.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
And the middle enterprises should strive to get into it.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
When you are given more money with reserves,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
than you need to make the production process.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
And to give as a commodity credit to your customers.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
An amazing situation.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
And I am glad that the audience of this lecture is in such a state.
