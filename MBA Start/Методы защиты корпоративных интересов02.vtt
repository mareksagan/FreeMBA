00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The next topic we will discuss today is the personnel safety of the company.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
As I said, personnel safety of the company is generally very weak.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
In general, everything that concerns the human factor is the weakest link in the corporate security system.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
We are considering the issues that we will discuss today.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
These are the threats that the company faces from the human factor.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
These are the options for implementing these threats.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
As I said in the first part, there are threats and options for implementing these threats.

00:42.000 --> 00:54.000
Let's talk about personnel safety.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Let's talk about the procedure of hiring employees,

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
the procedure of firing employees in terms of personnel safety.

01:07.000 --> 01:20.000
And let's talk about the use of polygraphs in the testing of employees.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
The first question is the threats to the interests of the company applied to the human factor.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
Basically, the threats to the interests of the company applied to the human factor are three basic threats.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
These are all the threats to the actions of the law enforcement officers,

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
actions that fall under the criminal code or the administrative code.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
These can be theft, fraud, or other actions.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
The second basic threat is the disclosure of secrets by the law enforcement.

02:10.000 --> 02:22.000
This can be the disclosure of commercial secrets, personal data, professional secrets in the form of medical, notarial, etc.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Everything that concerns the disclosure of information.

02:25.000 --> 02:34.000
The third basic threat is the implementation of incompetent actions.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
They can be legal, but they are simply incompetent and can damage the company's interests.

02:40.000 --> 02:54.000
Let's consider the issue of information leakage,

02:54.000 --> 03:05.000
the disclosure of information as a threat.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
What are the possible ways to implement this threat?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
There are several options.

03:13.000 --> 03:27.000
First, through the employees of the company.

03:27.000 --> 03:42.000
People work in the company, and they can disclose the information that has become known to them in the framework of their work.

03:42.000 --> 03:57.000
This can be done through an employee.

03:57.000 --> 04:07.000
A person is employed in the company to disclose information or to commit illegal actions.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
The goal is not fundamental.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
A person is employed to commit illegal actions.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
This is not a unique thing.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
The organization can be implemented by competitors or by organizations.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
This is a channel of information disclosure.

04:29.000 --> 04:43.000
The channel of information disclosure is through the fired employees.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
People are fired from the organization.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
This is a normal process.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
We have a labor code that states that any employee can file a complaint about leaving on their own will,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and then be free to work for a maximum of two weeks.

04:58.000 --> 05:09.000
It is difficult to say that an employee will not disclose any confidential information that has become known to him at work.

05:10.000 --> 05:32.000
It is difficult to say that an employee will not disclose any confidential information that has become known to him at work.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
The legal practice states that such cases are almost unique and difficult to implement.

05:38.000 --> 05:52.000
Therefore, a large threat is posed by the fired employees, because a large channel of information disclosure is through the fired employees.

05:53.000 --> 06:04.000
If we continue to describe the three main channels of information disclosure,

06:04.000 --> 06:26.000
we can say that there are several options for information disclosure through the employees.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
The first is the so-called motivated disclosure.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
The second is the unmotivated disclosure.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
The third is the unmotivated disclosure.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
The unmotivated disclosure is a disclosure where there are no motives for disclosing this information.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
In a simplified version, this is the simplest and most elementary type of disclosure.

06:57.000 --> 07:07.000
People simply do not represent the value of the information they possess, and are simply unmotivated and unmotivated.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Unfortunately, this is a serious problem.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
In teams where a large number of people work, there are people who are simply unmotivated and unmotivated.

07:18.000 --> 07:30.000
Explaining to them what is allowed and what is not allowed, usually does not lead to anything, because people usually disclose everything.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Even if you tell them that it is impossible to say, on the contrary, they will probably disclose it to a greater extent.

07:35.000 --> 07:45.000
Therefore, everything that concerns unmotivated disclosure, these people are usually calculated,

07:45.000 --> 07:56.000
they are usually limited by confidential information, and in the future, under some pretexts, they are fired.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
It is very difficult to cure them, and usually useless.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
There are certain criteria by which these people are calculated,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
that is, in principle, it is easy to calculate them, it is simple to calculate them,

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
and there are certain psychological features of these people.

08:13.000 --> 08:23.000
These may be people who abuse alcohol, because what is sober in the mind, is drunk in the tongue.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
That is, a person in a state of alcohol intoxication simply discloses this information.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
These are people who are creatively involved, it is very difficult to draw a line between them,

08:35.000 --> 08:45.000
when a person can still control his actions, and when a person cannot control his actions.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
That is, in the burst of creativity, a person can simply disclose and reveal commercial secrets.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
These are impulsive people, these are people who are dissatisfied with something,

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
very often women's groups suffer from this, that is, unmotivated disclosure of information.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
A person does not get anything for this, no dividends, no material benefits,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
he just discloses information because of his easy-going and talkativeness.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
A lot of information is disclosed in smoking rooms, from the point of view of unmotivated things.

09:19.000 --> 09:28.000
Sometimes it is enough to ask a person how are you doing, and get a lot of interesting confidential information.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
This is all that concerns unmotivated disclosure through employees of the company.

09:34.000 --> 09:45.000
Motivated disclosure is a disclosure that is based on certain motives.

09:46.000 --> 09:56.000
Moreover, motives can be used not only for disclosure of information, but also for some illegal actions.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
If we talk about motives, the list of these motives is quite large.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
It cannot be said that it is exhaustive, that is, everything that concerns motivated disclosure,

10:10.000 --> 10:19.000
is usually a psychological feature of people, and all motivated disclosure is based on psychology.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
Since psychology is different for each person, the list of motives is not exhaustive.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
There are, I would say, the most common motives and the least common motives.

10:33.000 --> 10:41.000
If we talk about the most common motivated disclosure, it is probably money.

10:41.000 --> 10:50.000
This is greed, this is the use of money to get some information or make a person do some actions.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
That is, a person discloses information or performs some actions, and in return receives a certain amount of money.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
There is an active approach and a passive approach.

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
The passive approach assumes that a person finds people who know certain information,

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
of course, valuable information, some kind of private information, people who have more expenses than income,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
that is, people in need of money.

11:32.000 --> 11:41.000
They are offered to solve their material problems in exchange for, say, disclosure of some information or performing some actions.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
This is the so-called passive approach.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
The active approach is when a person in need of some confidential information,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
but unfortunately he does not need money,

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
then an active event is held to make this person need money.

11:58.000 --> 12:08.000
Then he is offered to solve his material problems in order to get some information from him or make him perform some actions.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
How to make a person need money?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Again, this is a creative question, there are many different options.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
If this is a greedy person, then you can take him to a casino.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
If this is an enthusiastic person, then you can give him a woman, or some other things.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
There are many ways to make him take a loan that he cannot pay.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
This is a creative approach.

12:31.000 --> 12:40.000
This approach is widely used, because money is a fairly universal product that many people need.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
The second point that is widely used is the point of offense.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
Why does a person perform some actions or disclose information?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Simply because he was offended.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
He can be offended for various reasons.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
It can be some legal offenses, it can be illegal offenses,

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
offense for illegal dismissal, offense for not taking a position,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
offense for not realizing some creative potential, and so on.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
In general, an offended person is always a bomb of slow action,

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
which, as a rule, explodes at the most inappropriate moment.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
So, I want to say that you should try to make sure that you do not offend people.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Because an offended person is usually a problem.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Especially an offended person who knows the commercial secrets and has some certain powers.

13:38.000 --> 13:49.000
There are quite a few cases in life when the offense of a person leads to a serious problem in the company.

13:49.000 --> 13:58.000
The third point is quite common, I would say,

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
concerning the motivated disclosure of information or motivated performance of some actions.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
This is blackmail.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
This is blackmail.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
What is blackmail?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Blackmail is clear.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
This is a certain compromising action of this person,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
which has a certain evidence base of these actions.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
And a person is blackmailed by some things,

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
that is, by some actions that this person has committed or, perhaps, has committed around this person.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
As a rule, the higher the position a person occupies,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
the more he takes care of his impeccable reputation.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
And, as a rule, he is more susceptible to blackmail.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
Therefore, this motive for disclosure of information or for performing some actions related to blackmail,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
it is usually used for the leading link.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
Because blackmailing a loader with immoral acts is quite pointless,

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
because he can do these immoral acts every day and not regret it at all.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
And the leader, let's say, the organization or some leading link,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
can be very sensitive in terms of his impeccable reputation.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Blackmailing is generally based on…

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Again, there are several approaches.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
As a rule, the approach is active and passive.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Active and passive.

15:31.000 --> 15:39.000
The passive approach is to find out the compromising information about the past life of a person.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
And it is already a blackmail object.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
That is, this is the information or the actions that a person has committed in the past.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
In principle, as far as I understand, every person has some dark sides of his life.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
As the English say, every person has his own skeleton in the closet.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
The most important thing is to find some evidence of these dark moments

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
and think about how to use them for blackmail or discrediting.

16:10.000 --> 16:17.000
Active blackmail is when there is no time to look for this compromising information

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
or when there is no time.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
Then the organization conducts an event to make a person commit some compromising actions.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
In the future, all this is removed, fixed and used for blackmail or discrediting.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
Unfortunately, the compilation of compromising information is a shadow business,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
which is unfortunately developing in Russia.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
There are even whole organizations that specialize in the compilation of compromising information.

16:48.000 --> 16:57.000
The compilation of all these information resources can go in different directions.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
There are detectives who are engaged in the collection of information,

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
including information of dubious content.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Sometimes information agencies are engaged in this.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Unfortunately, this business is quite developed.

17:17.000 --> 17:28.000
The following three reasons for disclosing information are the main reasons.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
I say that the list of reasons is not exhaustive.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
If we talk about other reasons, what can I pay attention to?

17:37.000 --> 17:47.000
For example, the fear of a person for his life, for himself and his loved ones.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
A person can have an impeccable reputation,

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
he can never take money, never get into a tricky situation,

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
never commit any compromising actions.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
A person is weak by nature,

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
he has a surrounding in the form of a wife, husband, children, material values, business interests, etc.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
For this reason, he can worry.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
This can also be a way for one person to influence another person

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
in order to get some information or to commit some actions.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
The motive can be the most common factor of pain.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
A person can have an impeccable reputation,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
but unfortunately, he will be punished.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
He will tell everything he knows and everything he does not know.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Fortunately, this is not so often applied now.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
But it should be assumed that a person can tell everything he knows.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Then we talk about methods of influence,

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
about means, methods, measures, purposefulness, etc.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Therefore, the framework of security is usually based on the fact

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
that a person can disclose and tell all the information resources he knows.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
There is such a motive, let's say, sexual emotionality.

19:19.000 --> 19:33.000
This is not blackmail, this is a so-called sexual partner's set-up

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
in order to get information or to force him to commit some illegal actions.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
At the level of world practice, let's remember the matchmaker Mata Hari in the First World War.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
She earned information with her body.

19:48.000 --> 19:55.000
This is a channel of information getting.

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
There are some motives of information getting, let's call them national motives.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
Fortunately or unfortunately, our country is multinational.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
Businesses are often built on national characteristics.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
If people of one nation are in one organization,

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
and a person of the same nation or ethnicity is in another organization,

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
then the channels of influence, that is, the motives, can be based on nationality.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
We are of the same blood, from the same settlement, from the same region.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Tell me, share, etc.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
There are quite a lot of cases in life.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Motives can be religious.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Although this is not often found in business.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
Our country, fortunately or unfortunately, is multi-religious.

20:57.000 --> 21:06.000
And the information can be obtained on the basis of various religious motives and aspects.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
There is a motive related to depression.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
A person has certain psychological features,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
related to some depressive state.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Either he is entering a special state of depression,

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
or he can periodically fall into a state of depression,

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
a state of affect, a state of psychological uneasiness.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
At this moment, a person receives information,

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
or forces him to disclose it, or to perform some actions.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
There is a motive related to, let's say, the inner adventurism of a person.

21:49.000 --> 21:59.000
Inner adventurism of a person.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
This motive is independent, it is usually not used.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
This motive is associated with some other motives.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
It is clear that there may not be one motive,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
there may be several motives for obtaining information.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Basically, this motive is associated with inner adventurism.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
It is used for some young people who like to play Stirlitz,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
scouts, in some kind of adventure games.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Such cases also occur.

22:32.000 --> 22:41.000
There are motives associated with psychological things.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
The basis is psychology.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
That is, the motive of obtaining information.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
I will stop here in detail.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Two options are common now.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
This is the so-called NLP,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Neuro-Linguistic Programming,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
and this is hypnosis.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Hypnosis is a more rigid option.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
It is used not at every step, but nevertheless it is used.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
NLP is now widely used.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
In a nutshell, I will draw this thing.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
The use of NLP elements in personnel work,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
including personnel safety.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
NLP, Neuro-Linguistic Programming,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
was used for a long time,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
probably several centuries ago.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
For the first time, the English started to talk about NLP

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
in the Second World War.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
The English scouts started to use NLP elements.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
How to get information from a person?

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
The American scientists translated this into a scientific basis.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
In the 1950s, it was generally considered that NLP was an American product.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Although the Americans just made a scientific justification

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
and put it all on a scientific basis.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
The methods of NLP were developed long ago.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
Several elements related to NLP are used.

24:14.000 --> 24:25.000
In particular, if you want to get in touch with a person

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
in order to get information from him,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
there is such a principle of mirroring in NLP.

24:31.000 --> 24:39.000
You duplicate the movement, walk, breath of another person.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
After a while, there is a certain comfort between you

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
and a certain position of one person from another.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And you can try to get information from a person.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
What do I mean by duplication?

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
A person is sitting in the same position.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
You can adjust your breathing to his breathing.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
If we talk about safety,

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
thieves and pocket watchmen use this method very widely.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
When a person is sitting in a train and he is sleeping,

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
a thief sits down and starts to swing.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
After a while, there is a certain harmony between these two people.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And this thief can say,

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
let's give him a wallet and he will give it to him.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
This is the relationship between each other

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
at the level of neural linguistic programming.

25:35.000 --> 25:44.000
Let's say NLP is a method of transferring information.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
It is a way to convince a person to do something or to disclose something.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
Each person has a certain channel of receiving information.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
All people are divided into so-called audiolysts, visualists and kinesthetics.

26:03.000 --> 26:11.000
Audiolysts are people who perceive the world through the organs of vision.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
They need to see everything.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
They say, I see.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
In order to achieve the location of these people,

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
that is, to make them disclose some information,

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
they need to be transmitted through their organs of vision.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
They need to write everything,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
they need to look good,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
because this is primary information for them.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
Audiolysts perceive everything by ear.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
They say, I hear.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
In order to achieve their location or make them do something,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
make them disclose information,

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
they need to be transmitted through the organs of hearing.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
If we talk about the third direction of kinesthetics,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
they usually say, I feel.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
These are people who need to touch, feel everything.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
That is, to receive information from the outside world

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
through the contact, through kinesthetic sensations.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
In order to achieve their location,

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
to make them do something or to transmit some information,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
they need to touch, feel something.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Then they will transmit this information.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Therefore, one of the directions,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
for example, how the NLP element is used,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
is to understand who is in front of you,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
an audiolyst, a visualist or a kinesthetic,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
and try to convince him to do something

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
exactly on the channel that he has the most developed.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
This is NLP.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
NLP is widely used now

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
to train sales staff.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
That is, how to convince a person to buy something.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
NLP is widely used

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
to convince a person to do something,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
in particular, to buy something.

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
NLP is widely used in personnel security,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
in negotiations.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
That is, in order to convince a person to do something,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
to convince him to make a decision,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
to tell about something,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
NLP is used.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Hypnosis is a more serious thing,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
a rather scary thing.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
It is used less often than NLP,

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
but nevertheless it is a very serious threat

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
in terms of personnel security.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
What is the threat?

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
As a rule, everything that concerns

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
illegal actions on hypnosis

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
is either disclosure of information,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
or the execution of some actions,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
or, again, the conviction of something.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Moreover, disclosure of information

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
in a state of hypnosis,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
a person can disclose this information,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
and in the future he will not even remember

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
that he first told something to someone,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
and he will not remember,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
and he will tell only the truth,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
only what actually exists.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
In a state of hypnosis, he will not deceive,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
he will not deceive,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
he will not mislead,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
he will tell the truth.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
This is a feature of hypnosis.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
And he will not remember that he told something to someone.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
You can make someone do some actions

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
in a state of hypnosis.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Gypsies use hypnosis a lot.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Unfortunately, these are such illegal actions

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
that can be done using elements of hypnosis.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
In banking security,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
you can face problems with hypnosis.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
In particular, a few years ago,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
there was a problem with exchange points.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
A person who had a cashier

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
entered the cashier of the exchange point

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
in a state of hypnotic sleep,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
gave, for example, 10 rubles,

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
convinced her that it was not 10 rubles,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
but 1000 dollars,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
and the cashier gave a change,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
and the cashier,

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
the employee of the exchange point,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
exchanged the change

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
based on a completely different bill.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
There was such a problem.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
A whole group of people

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
who were engaged in such things

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
was neutralized.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
The problem of hypnosis,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
unfortunately, is quite relevant.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
How to protect yourself from hypnosis?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Immediately a question arises.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
How is it solved?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
It is quite difficult to introduce

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
a person into a hypnotic sleep.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
There are times when you can understand

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
that something is wrong with a person.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
At this moment, try to get away from this person,

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
try to stop some actions.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
Hypnosis is transmitted through the gaze,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
through hearing, through touch.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Therefore, at the initial stage,

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
you can still try to do something.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Hypnosis cannot be said

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
to be some kind of contraindicatory

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
initial action,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
or rather, that it is initial evil.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It is like a way of affecting

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
one person on another.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
This method can be used

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
either for good or evil.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Hypnosis is taught.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
There is such a concept as medical hypnosis.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
That is, the state of hypnosis

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
takes a person out of a state

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
of severe stress.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Hypnosis can be used

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
for contraindicatory purposes.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
That is, the purpose, as I said,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
is either to get information,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
or to perform some actions,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
or to gain a belief.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
There are quite exotic methods

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
to come up with a purpose for hypnosis.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
A person enters a state of hypnosis,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
reads certain information,

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
and then leaves the state of hypnosis.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
He moves to another country,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
where he is introduced

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
to the state of hypnosis.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
He tells all this,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
although he will not remember it himself.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
That is, it is like using a person

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
as a carrier of certain information.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Unfortunately, hypnosis and all

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
that concerns psychological methods

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
is one of the motives for obtaining information.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
On the basis of not only the conscious,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
but also the unconscious motive.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
There may be other motives

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
for obtaining information,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
but I have described them to you

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
as the most common and significant.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
If we talk about the objects

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
that are most subject to the motives

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
for obtaining information,

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
based on the motives that exist,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
these are those that have certain defects

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
in behavior, in psychological appearance,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
passion for alcohol,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
sexual entertainment, drugs, etc.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Or those who have a biographical stain.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
All these motives are used

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
to obtain information.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
But what is the purpose of hypnosis?

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
What is the purpose of hypnosis?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Objects suitable for the motives

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
for obtaining information

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
are those who have debts.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
It is clear that people who have debts

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
are a group of risk.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
These are people who can be used

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
by various techniques

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
in order to either get information

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
from them or force them to do some actions.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
People who are strongly attached to something.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
People who, for some reason,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
are not able to get information

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
from them,

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
and who are very irritated for some reason.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
So-called recruitment based on resentment.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I did not tell these points

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
from the point of view

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
that you received information

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
from someone,

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
and used these motivated things.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
I probably told it from the point of view

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
that these motives

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
for obtaining information

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
or for performing some actions

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
can be used against you.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
If you are an object,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
let's say, an LPR,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
a person who makes decisions,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
then these motives

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
can be used against you

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
in order to either get information

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
from you or force you to do something.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Therefore, there are some recommendations

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
that, let's say,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
recommendations on counteracting

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the establishment of so-called

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
recruitment contact,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
or motivated contact.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Well, it is not to get involved

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
in quarrels and scandals,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
not to show excessive awareness

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
in anything,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
except when it is required

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
during some business negotiations.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
It is clear that

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
those people who usually

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
use these motivated approaches

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
are those people,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
let's say,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
who either know something

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
or can learn something.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
If a person does not know

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
what to do,

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
then, in general,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
there is no point in

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
performing some recruitment approaches

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
in order to get some information.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Therefore, it is not appropriate,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
probably, as a recommendation,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
to show that you know something,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
have some commercial secrets,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
some secrets, and so on.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
There is a recommendation

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
related to the storage

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
of your commercial secrets,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
your, let's say,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
official secrets

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
from your close friends.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Well, this is due to the fact

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
that they will be able

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
to get information

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
not only from you,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
but also from your environment,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
that is, from your close friends.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
First of all, you are just setting up

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
these people, because they will

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
already receive information from them.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Well, of course, there is no guarantee

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
that they will protect your secrets.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
That is, they told their life

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
companions some commercial secrets,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
and the next day

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
it became known all over the city.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Unfortunately, there were such

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
real-life cases.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Well, the analysis of your life,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
probably,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
is not the goal

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
of what I have achieved

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
in 30, 40,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
50, 60 years.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
The analysis of your life

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
from the point of view of determining

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
some motives in this life,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
some moments related

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
to problems,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
to situations

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
that can be used

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
for blackmail or discrediting.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Well, it is clear that

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
nothing can be changed

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
from the past life,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
that is, you will not change anything

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
in your past life,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
but at least you will be able

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
to illuminate these moments

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
from your point of view

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
to break the ground

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
from those people

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Well, the recommendation

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
may be to find out

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
your weaknesses,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
that is, to analyze your psychological

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
components,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
your hobbies, alcohol, sex,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
money, character traits, and so on.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I, of course, do not urge you

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
to change these character traits

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
if you think it is necessary,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
but for God's sake.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Just keep in mind that these approaches,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
motivated approaches to disclosure of information,

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
they usually use some psychological

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
components of a person.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Knowing them, you will simply know

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
that these motives may be suitable for you

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
in order to get information from you

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
or make you do some actions.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Well, probably

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
what else can be recommended?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Well, the analysis of contacts

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
is also a recommendation

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
to counteract the establishment

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
of such agent contacts,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
because if you understand

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
why a person starts

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
trying to get close to you,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
it's probably good.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
That is, you need to give a clear report

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
why a person starts trying to get close to you.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
If it is some kind of physiological

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
needs, it is understandable.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
When it is not clear why a person

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
does it, then it is always

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
a so-called hazard.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Well, this is the point.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
So, what else

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I would like to draw

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
your attention to?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Well, now we are with you,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
in general, I told you

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
the moments related

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
to the threats

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
that arise from the human factor,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
and some of the moments

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I covered the options

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
for the implementation of these threats.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
The next aspect is

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
how to build personnel work,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
how to build relationships

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
with the staff

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
from the point of view of personnel security,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
in order to neutralize all the moments

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
related to the threat

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
of disclosure of information

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
or the threat of committing

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
some illegal actions.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
So, personnel work.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
So, here I will cover

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
some aspects

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
that are related to security,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
almost directly related to security,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
but I will not go into

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
the details of this topic,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
which should be taken into account

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
when the event will be held.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
So, this is the motivation of the staff.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Motivation of the staff.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
The term is quite fashionable,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
motivation of the staff.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
There is even such a term as

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
motivated staff,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
unmotivated staff.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I like the term motivated

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
because it is associated

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
with the term to swear.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Nevertheless,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
such a term is used.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
What is motivation?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Motivation is, in fact,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
not a hook,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
but some reasons

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
why a person works in an organization.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Naturally, the more reasons,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
the more hooks,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
the more moments

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
that make a person work

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
in an organization,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
the less problematic

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
this person is.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
With a motivated person,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
it is much easier to solve

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
security issues.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
There is even a whole seminar

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
about motivation.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I will just tell you

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
the problem of motivation

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
from the point of view

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
of personnel security.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
All motivation is divided

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
into two large groups.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
This is immaterial.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
It is clear.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Material motivation is

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
motivation that is

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
related to certain material benefits.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Immaterial motivation is

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
motivation that is not

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
related to material benefits.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
So, more strongly

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
immaterial motivation is considered.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
It is clear that

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
material motivation is related

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
to money or material benefits.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
In any case,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
some organization can offer

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
more material benefits,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
and a person will leave you.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Therefore, it is believed

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
that the strongest motivation

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
is immaterial.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
The strongest, perhaps,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
immaterial motivation is

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
ideology.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Ideology.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
It is difficult to achieve

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
ideological motivation

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
in a commercial structure.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I have not encountered

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
companies where the staff

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
is motivated from the point of view

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
of ideology.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
But if it succeeds,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
it will be a very strong and solid company.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Ideology.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
What can be the forms,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
what can be the options?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
It can be, for example,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
religion.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
It can be some kind of

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
patriotic or corporate idea.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
It can be

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
the struggle of a small

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
oppressed people

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
for their self-awareness

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
and independence.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
It can be ideology or an idea.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
From the point of view of immaterial motivation,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
let's say, in Moscow,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
it is very common,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
it is the closeness of work to home.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The closeness of work to home.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
It is clear that

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
if a person lives in the north of Moscow,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
goes to the south of Moscow every day,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
spends several hours on the road,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
if a person finds

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
a company that will pay,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
all other

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
motivation systems will be the same,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
and a person finds

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
work near the house,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
he will leave the organization to work

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
near the house.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
So, the immaterial motivation

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
in the form of the closeness of work to home

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
is typical only for Moscow.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
For regional companies,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
it may not be very typical.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
What can be noted

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
from the immaterial?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Let's say, self-employment.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Self-employment.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Very strong immaterial motivation

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
is due to the fact that

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
a person works because he likes it.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
He likes to paint.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
He will paint every day.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
If you assign him to a position

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
related to leadership,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
he will not work because he does not like it.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Here,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
from the immaterial motivation,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
is the moral-psychological climate.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Moral-psychological climate.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Why does a person work?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Because it is a very comfortable

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
moral-psychological climate.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
A person may not get a salary for half a year

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
and will go to work.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Why does he go to work?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
The team is good, the company is good.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And a person can get

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
very decent money,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
but he leaves work because

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
everyone is like scorpions in a jar,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
everyone is trying to sting each other.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Material motivation

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
is money.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
A person must receive

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
a certain monetary reward

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
for his work.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
This monetary reward

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
should not be lower

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
than the average

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
in the region,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
in the industry,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
in the position, etc.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Then it will be material motivation

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
based on money.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
It can be from material motivation

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
some kind of social package.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Now it is a very fashionable direction.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
In personnel policy,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
it is a social package.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
In addition to money,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
a person receives certain benefits

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
related to social protection,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
social security.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It can be a compensation

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
for travel,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
free lunch,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
some kind of trips,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
a social package.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
It can be a brand.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I would put the word

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
brand here.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
A brand company.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
A person works

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
in a very respectable

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
brand company.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
He is proud of it.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
He has a certain corporate culture, etc.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Material motivation

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
usually includes

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
working conditions.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Working conditions.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
A person works

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
in good conditions,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
with air conditioners,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
with repairs, with Euro-repair,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
modern equipment, etc.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
The other thing is that

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
working conditions can be much worse.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
It is not motivated.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
The material motivation

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
is financial commitment.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Financial commitment.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It is about the fact

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
that a person binds

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
a worker to himself

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
by financial commitments.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
He can send him to school,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
pay for his education,

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
buy him an apartment,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
etc.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
A person is bound

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
to a company by financial commitments.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
The most important thing here

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
is not to overdo it

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
and not to abuse it.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
If a person is too much

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
bound to a company by financial commitments,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
it is difficult to get rid of it.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
This is a very common

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
material motivation of a person.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
There may be

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
some other options.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
For example,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
this is not material,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
but a given authority.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
A given authority.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
It can be

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
some personal goals

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
of a person.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
It can be material

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
or not.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
For example,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
a person gets a work experience.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
He is interested in getting

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
a certain work experience.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
This is a motivation

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
of a person working in a company.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
You can write it down further.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
This is not an exhaustive list.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
These are just the main directions

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
of a person's work experience.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I want to add

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
one more thing.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I want to stop at this point.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
The more motivated

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
a person is,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
the less problems

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
he will have.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I have encountered

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
situations

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
when a company

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
is creating a promising direction

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
or a promising project.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
There are two candidates

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
for this position.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
One is Ivan Ivanov,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
the other is Petrov Petrovich.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
The situation is analyzed

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
by these people

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
and by the security service.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
The security service

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
says that Ivan Ivanov

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
is well motivated

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
and has a lot of reasons

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
why he works

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
in this company.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
There are no problems

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
with this information.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Petrov Petrovich

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
is a professional,

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
but he has no reasons

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
why he works here.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Either we should appoint Ivan Ivanov

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
or Petrov.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
We should organize

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
an event

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
to motivate this person.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
We should bind him to this company.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Then we can trust him

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
with a promising project

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
if we want him to be a leader

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
and a competitor.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
The motivation of the staff

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
is directly connected

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
with the security service.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
The next thing

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I would like to point out

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
is the security service line.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
It is

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
professionalism.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Professionalism is not only

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
among the security service employees.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Everyone should be a professional

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
in his or her field.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Then it is much more effective

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
to build a security system

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
than when

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
non-professionals work.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Professionalism is achieved

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
by a competent selection of staff.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
You can train your staff

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
to become professionals.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You can use a staff agency.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
You can recruit people.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
You can do hand-hunting.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
You can lure staff.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
The point is

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
to form a team.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
It is a fashionable method

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
of teamwork.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
The next thing I would like to point out

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
is the moral and psychological climate.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
The moral and psychological climate.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
It is important to understand

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
that the security of the staff

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
and the security of the organization

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
depends on the moral and psychological climate.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
To put it simply,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
if the CEO

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
rides the latest Mercedes model

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
and the employees

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
do not receive their salary for six months,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
then there is no need

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
to talk about serious security.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
You will never build a security system there.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
The moral and psychological climate

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
is achieved by several things.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It is a whole set of events.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It is like a training process.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
It is a whole set of events.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
The formation of

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
the so-called corporate culture

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
is achieved.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
The corporate culture.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I can say that

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
the corporate culture

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
is based on the behavior

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
of a person.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
It is not based on

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
any external forms.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
We all wear red jackets.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
This is our corporate culture.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
If a person wears a blue jacket,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
it is a violation of corporate culture.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It is not about

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
the appearance.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
It is about the behavior.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
It is a code of behavior.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
The moral and psychological climate

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
can be formed

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
by the work of psychologists.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Psychologists

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
are often used

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
for the security

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
of the staff

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
and the corporate security.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Because many problems

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
can be solved

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
by the professional work

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
of a psychologist

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
when the psychologist

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
is a professional.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
It is about

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
the moral and psychological climate.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
It is about the selection of staff.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
There are organizations

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
where psychologists work

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
professionally

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
for the security of the staff.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
But I can say that

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
the organizations

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
do not use the resources of psychologists.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
For example,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
a team is excited

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
because it is not efficient.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
A psychologist,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
after testing the team

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
and making a psychological portrait

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
of each person,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
will tell the psychologist

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
to remove a person from the team.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
The team becomes calm

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
and efficient.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
This is the work of a psychologist.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Psychologists are widely used

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
when setting up staff.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
It is right to understand

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
that there is a psychological feature

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
of a person that cannot be changed.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
But it can be used.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
There are four types of personalities.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
There is a blood type,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
a melancholic,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
a phlegmatic, a choleric.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
It is what is given by nature

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
and what does not change.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Knowing who is in front of you

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
of these four types of personalities,

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
you can understand

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
how to use it.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
There is a concept

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
of a strong nervous system,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
a person can work

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
for 8 hours

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
in a monotonous and scrupulous way.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Then he should rest for 8 hours.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
A weak nervous system

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
is a person who works

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
for half an hour,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
then he should rest for half an hour.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
It does not mean that it is a bad

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
or good nervous system.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It is a certain psychological feature.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Knowing it, you will set up people

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
and there will be fewer problems.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Psychologists can assess

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
whether a person can work with people

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
or not.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
If a person is well-led

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
by 5 people,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
you will put him

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
on a team of 100 people.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
The psychology of a person

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
will not allow him

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
to lead 100 people.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
If he leads 5 people well,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
he will not be able to lead 100 people.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Not because he is bad,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
but because it is a psychological feature.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
There is a concept of an introvert.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
A person is either closed

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
or communicative.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
If you put a person

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
to work in a closed sales department,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
he will not be able to work

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
because he is a thing in himself.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
That is why psychologists work very well

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
in the field of personnel safety.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
There are

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
other points

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
about personnel safety.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
There is a certain percentage ratio.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
If we talk about

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
theft,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
then the issue of

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
theft is a problem.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
10% of people

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
always steal.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
No matter

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
what motivation

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
they have,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
what salary they have.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
This is a habit.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
10%

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
never

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
steal.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
They

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
steal

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
because

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
they believe

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
that

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
no matter

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
how difficult

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
the situation is,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
they will never steal.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
80%

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
steal when

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
there are conditions

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
and when there is no control.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
They steal

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
when there are conditions.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
When there are conditions.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Roughly speaking,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
a person will take

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
some money

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
when he understands

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
that he will be punished.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
You can argue about the percentage.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
It is written in smart books.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
This is about our country.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
In Muslim countries,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
where there is a fence

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
where fingers and hands are cut off,

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
the percentage may be completely different.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
In our country, the ratio is approximately the same.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
So,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
based on this,

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
what is the task

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
of the security service?

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
It is clear that

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
those people who always steal

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
should be eliminated.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Those people who never steal

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
should be left

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
if they represent something.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
The biggest problem is

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
these 80%.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
The main task here

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
is not to create conditions for stealing.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
If you are engaged

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
in some provocative activities,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
you will put money somewhere

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
and see who will take it and who will not.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
You will find out that

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
90% of people

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
will take the money

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
if they know that no one sees them.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
You can fire all of them

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
and get new 90%.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
The ratio will be exactly the same.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I am very skeptical

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
about various

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
provocative activities

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
of the security service

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
because

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
the percentage is exactly the same.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
We should not create conditions.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I would like to draw your attention

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
to one more thing.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
There is a term

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
for critical or problematic people.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
To address

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
the attention

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
of either critical people

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
or critical employees.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
What is it?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
As I said,

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
if we talk about

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
disclosure of information,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
the whole team is scanned

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
in terms of identifying

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
those people who can

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
do the right thing

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
or disclose the information.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Those people

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
are paid more attention.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
What do I mean?

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Let's say,

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
IT specialist

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
or IT security

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
is engaged in protection

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
of information resources.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
This is a critical person

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
because he needs special attention.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
The secretary of the company

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
may not know anything

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
but she is responsible

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
for a lot of confidential documents.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
It can be

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
the same cleaners

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
who can

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
do some illegal actions

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
in terms of

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
disclosure of information,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
installation of listening devices, etc.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
If we talk about

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
critical employees

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
who can do some illegal actions,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
the whole team is scanned

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and it looks like

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
the person

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
needs money

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
for different reasons.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
The patient needs an expensive surgery

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
and the patient has no money

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
for the surgery.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
But he will have to solve this problem.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
We can assume that he will do

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
some illegal actions

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
because he will try

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
to find money illegally.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Many things

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
can be predicted.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You know,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
a person came from

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
a state-owned organization

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
of a factory

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
where the principle was

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
that the owner is not a guest

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and he has to carry every nail.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The person has a habit

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
of stealing.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
We can assume that he has this habit

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
and he has not gotten rid of it.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Let's recall a famous story

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
about a golden calf

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
when Shura Balaganov

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
gave a huge amount of money

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
to the bandit

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
who would have enough money

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
for his days.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And he got into a tram

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
with 3 rubles.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Why did he get into the tram?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Because of his habit.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Many things can be predicted.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
If you see

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
or hear about

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
security services

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
that there is a security guard

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
and they have some intimate relations

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and they are connected by work,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
so the security guard is watching the cashier,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
then you can assume

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
that their actions will be illegal.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
They should be divorced,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
at least by the service,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
so that they are not connected.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Many illegal actions

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
can be predicted.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
A woman works,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
she marries a man

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
who works in a competing company.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Can we predict any consequences?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I think we can.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
We can try to predict

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and prevent

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
any consequences

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
related to these critical people.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I will give you

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
only a few examples.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You can describe it in detail later.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Life is too multifaceted,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
so many things can be predicted.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It is possible.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I will remind you

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
about the old principle

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
of the personnel policy.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It is the principle of a wick and a gingerbread.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
A wick and a gingerbread.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It is very effective

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
from the perspective of personnel security.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
The principle of a wick and a gingerbread

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
should be applied

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
to people.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
There should be a gingerbread

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
in the form of motivation.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
There should be a wick

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
that is in the form of

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
responsibility.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Responsibility related to

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
the responsibility of the staff,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
administrative responsibility,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
criminal responsibility.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I will also draw your attention

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
to the personnel policy

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
on the line of personnel security.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
This is the relationship

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
between the security service

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and the personnel.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And the personnel.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Such relations will have to be established

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
in any case.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It should be based on

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
the example I gave

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
about the barricades.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
There should be a barricade

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
where the security service and the personnel

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
are not allowed to go.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And there should be

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
some illegal actions

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
or potential violations.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
How to build it?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
There are different points.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
In principle, the security service

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
should help the personnel.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
The personnel should look

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
at the security service

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
not as a monster,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
a mini KGB,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
who walks, looks,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
peeps, listens.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
The security service should help

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
the personnel.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But according to the law,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
it may not do it.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
According to the law,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
the security service

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
should provide security

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
only to the founder.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It is not obligatory

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
to solve the personal problems

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
of the employees of the enterprise.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
But I think it should be done

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
to build these relations.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And this help may not

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
be a big deal.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
For example,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
a person sells a car

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and receives cash.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And the person asks

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
to give a couple of people

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
to stand next to him.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
There is nothing wrong

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
or expensive for the security service.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
But this person will treat

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
the security service

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
as an organization

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
that can help and support.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And, of course,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
the security service

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
should provide

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
a certain number of people.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
They are called

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
voluntary assistants.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
This problem exists.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Such people are not always

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
called sex workers,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
secret employees,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
drummers,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
knockers, and so on.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
But here we should start

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
from the fact that there are

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
a lot of people

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
who are not

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
able to work.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
We should treat

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
the information

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
of the security service

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
positively or at least

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
calmly.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
If you drive a car

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
in Germany,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
10 old ladies will call the police

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
and report that the car

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
has exceeded the speed limit.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
They do not perceive

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
this quality.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Everyone understands that a car

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
that has exceeded the speed limit

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
is a threat

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
to the residents,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
to the elderly,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
to the children,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
to the grandchildren, and so on.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
The goal is to ensure

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
the security of the organization.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The more solid and secure

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
the organization is,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
the better the staff.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But this problem exists.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I will also mention

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
a rather fashionable

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
area.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It is the use of polygraph

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
in the company testing.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
The use of polygraph.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
The use of polygraph.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
What is a polygraph?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It is a lie detector.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I think everyone has heard about it.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It is a legal business.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
It is a legal product.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
You can find

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
a lot of companies

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
that provide services

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
of polygraph.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
They sell polygraph.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
There is nothing illegal here.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You can't say

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
that it is a tool

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
of some special services.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
What should be taken into account

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
if the security service

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
will use polygraph

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
in the personnel security?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The first thing

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
is the legal aspect.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The testing of polygraph

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
should be voluntary.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You can't test a person

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
with polygraph

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
just because

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
the director wants it.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
If a person doesn't want

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
to be tested,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
you can't force him.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
So, usually,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
if a polygraph is being tested,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
the application is collected

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
and the test is conducted.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Usually, it is a statement

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
of the testers' consent

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
to test polygraph.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
There are some features

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
of the contactless polygraph

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
that can be legended.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
You can't legend the contactless one.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
This is the first point.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Voluntary.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
The second point

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
of the polygraph testing

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
is that the result

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
is not a proof.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You can't fire a person

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
just because he showed polygraph.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You can't impose a conviction

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
on a person just because he showed polygraph.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It is like Stirlitz's

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
information to think.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
It is where you need to dig deeper.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It is a kind of information to think.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
When is polygraph used?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Usually,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
it is a

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
method of work.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
A method of work.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
There are organizations

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
that

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
constantly

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
use polygraph

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
when they come to work.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
If there is a need,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
it can be done.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
When they come to work,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
they usually find out

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
the standard options.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Does a person

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
use drugs?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Is he connected

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
to criminal elements?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Is he connected to criminals?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
To competitors?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Polygraph is used

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
in the current activity.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
What is the current activity?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The leader

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
wants to know

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
if the bribes are taken or not.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Do the employees

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
sit on the rolls?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
There is a kind of current activity.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
It is a common

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
case.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Nevertheless, there are companies

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
where the current activity

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
is provided

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
through polygraph.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The most common

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
option is

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
a service investigation.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
A service

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
investigation.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
When something

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
happened,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
some money was stolen,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
then a service investigation

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
is conducted

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
using polygraph.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
It is the most common

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
option.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
The types of polygraph

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
that you need to know

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
if you

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
use polygraph services.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Polygraph.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
What is available

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
on the market,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
what you can buy.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
There are two options.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Contact

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
and contactless.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Contactless.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Contactless.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
It is a classic

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
polygraph.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
There are 8-12 sensors

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
that track a person

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and measure his parameters.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Breathing,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
abdominal, chest,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
pulse, sweat,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
voice, pupil,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
tremor sensor,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
motor activity,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
muscle activity, etc.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
These sensors are

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
connected to a block

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
where all the information is stored.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Then a computer is connected,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
graphics are built, etc.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The principle of operation is simple.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It was developed in the 1920s.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
First, a person is set up.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
A polygraph is set up

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
for a specific person.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
First, a person is asked

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
questions,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
the answers to which are not known.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
For example,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
it is winter now,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and it is clear that a person answers yes.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It is necessary to answer

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
either yes or no.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
There is no need to think,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
fantasize, or invent.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
The parameters of a person are measured

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
when it is clear that he is telling the truth.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
After that,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
mathematical calculations

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
give certain conclusions

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
about whether a person is telling the truth

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
or not.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
This is a classical contact polygraph.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
A contact polygraph

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
is usually implemented

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
as a mind reader.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
It is a little bit

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
complicated.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
It is a simple

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
computer program.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
It is a computer program

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
that can be used

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
to read a book.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
There is a slightly different principle.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
The principle is a reaction of a person

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
to some questions.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
It is a question

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
whether the answer is meaningful

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
or not.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Usually, it is implemented

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
in the following way.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
You test a person on drugs.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
You are interested in the topic of drugs

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
that are applicable to this person.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Words are typed

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
that are related to drugs.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
The screen of the monitor

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
shows this word for 15 milliseconds.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Then it is closed

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
by some chaotic set of numbers.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
A person needs to press

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
a magic button

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
like a joystick.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
He needs to press it.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
The reaction of a person is measured.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
The reaction will be different

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
depending on whether

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
this word is meaningful or not.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It can be either fast

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
or slow.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It will change.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Then the meaning

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
of this topic

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
is determined.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
If a person

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
is indifferent to this topic

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and has a smooth reaction,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
his reaction will be the same

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
as when answering all other questions

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
or neutral questions.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
A person can have

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
no words.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
He will be covered by numbers.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
A person's consciousness

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
will not react

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
to this word

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
with such a small value.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
A word for 0.15 seconds

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
will not be reacted by consciousness.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You will not see what is written there.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
You will see only the numbers

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
that will close this word.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
But at the subconscious level

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
a person will react.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
The reaction will be different.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
This is the basis of the action

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
of this polygraph.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
It is widely popular.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It has many advantages

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
in relation to the contact.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It starts from time.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Testing one person

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
on a contactless polygraph

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
is much faster.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It can be legendarized.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
A person will press a button

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
and he will not even know

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
that he is being tested on a polygraph.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
He will just say

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
that he is being measured

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
by a person's reaction.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
It is much less painful.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
When a person is confused

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
by wires and sensors,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
it is a serious psychological trauma

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
or psychological pressure.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
A regular button

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
is much less painful

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
for a person.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Here are two options

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
either contact or contactless

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
that are available on the market

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
and can be bought.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
There is another option

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
but it is more theoretical.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It is developed by Americans.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
The idea is that

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
when a person tells the truth,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
he is involved in one number

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
of brain cells.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
If he tries to deceive,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
he is involved in a much larger number

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
of brain cells.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
The number of brain cells

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
involved is measured.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
If there are many of them,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
there is a possibility

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
that a person is deceiving.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
This polygraph

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
is still in the theoretical development stage.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Contact or contactless

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
is what you can buy

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
on the market.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
If we talk about

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
the use of a polygraph,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
what should we pay attention to?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
If you will

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
periodically use a polygraph

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
during a service investigation,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
you can invite a specialist.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
If you will use it every day,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
you need to take

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
a person,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
buy this device,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
teach this person,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
take him to the US,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
and so on.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
In the vast majority of cases,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
people usually use other services.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Here is another thing

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I want to draw your attention to

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
regarding the polygraph.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Keep in mind that a lot depends on the polygraphist.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
A polygraph is

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
a tool

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
that is like a gun.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
A good gun

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
will hit the target

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
in good hands,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
and in bad hands

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
it will not hit the target.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Although the gun itself will be good.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Therefore, a polygraph is good.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
But it is always deceiving not the polygraph,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
but the polygraphist.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
If you will choose

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
a polygraphist or polygraphologist,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
pay special attention to the polygraphist.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
A lot depends on him.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
There are

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
some ways to deceive the polygraph.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
There is a pharmacological way,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
that is,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
the use of some

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
inhibiting or stimulating drugs.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
There is a physiological

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
way,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
a mechanical way,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
that is, the use of some painful sensations

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
to bite your tongue,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
to knock down

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
the polygraph.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
There is a psychological way,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
that is, to think about something

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
that is significant or insignificant for you.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Nevertheless,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
a good polygraphist will understand

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
that he is being deceived.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
A contactless polygraph,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
what is good about it,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
it is difficult to deceive it,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
because a person does not even know

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
that he is being tested and will not understand

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
what he is being tested for.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Unlike a contactless polygraph,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
when it is clear that it is a polygraph,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
that all these questions are being tested.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Therefore, this is the point.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Whether you will apply it or not,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
you will see for yourself,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
but at least it is one of the directions

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
of the formation of the personnel security.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Here,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
what else

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I will draw your attention to.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Try not to plant bombs

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
of slow action

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
from the point of view

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
of personnel security.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
This is according to the line

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
of personnel security.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Do not plant bombs

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
of slow action.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I have already given examples.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
For example,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
if you fire a person

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
who knows your commercial secrets,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
in a bad way,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
it is a bomb of slow action.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
There are many such options.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Here I can recommend

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
the application of a test period

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
for employees,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
because, as a rule,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
this is also related to the issue of security.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Apply a certain policy

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
to select personnel

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
applicable to

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
certain categories of people.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
First of all,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
it is critical people.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
This is related to IT specialists,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
because, as a rule,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
they can pose a serious threat.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
A competent selection of the head

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
of the security service,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
where the first place,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
in my opinion,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
is not even a question of professionalism,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
but a question of loyalty.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
To people

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
who are appointed

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
to conduct some promising projects.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
These are some critical people.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Now let's talk about

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
the acceptance

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and dismissal

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
of employees.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
If we write down

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
the acceptance questions,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
what does the security service decide?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
What do the personnel decide?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
The personnel decide

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
the selection of employees,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
the selection of personnel

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
with personnel,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
and the issue of

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
the documentation.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
What does the security service decide?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
The security service

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
mainly decides

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
the inspection of employees.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
The inspection of candidates

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
for positions in your organization.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
The difficulty here is

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
that it is very difficult

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
to collect information

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
in a legal way.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
There is a concept

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
of personal data,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
there are personal data laws,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
and it is very difficult

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
to collect legal information.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Unlike legal information collection

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
for legal persons.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Everything can be done legally,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
but for personal data

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
it is difficult.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
The inspection of the security service

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
of candidates

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
is based on different things.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
It is mainly assessed

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
by the threat to the organization

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
or not.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
In order to make a decision

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
whether a person poses a threat

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
to the organization or not,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
the circle of information

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
about what is collected is determined.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
What information is collected?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
What information

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
is collected about the candidate?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
It is clear that

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
all the information

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
about a person

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
can be collected,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
but it will be expensive and meaningless.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
You can collect information

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
about the coffee service

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
in the kitchen

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
and what is the name of your favorite dog.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
From the point of view of security

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
for the organization,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
the circle of questions

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
and answers is determined.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
This is all about

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
objective data.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Objective data

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
can be obtained

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
by means of documents

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
that a person presents.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
For example, a passport,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
driver's license,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
education documents, etc.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Objective data

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
can be collected

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
by means of a questionnaire

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
that a person fills out.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
This is a normal practice

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
when a person

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
fills out a questionnaire.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Try to make the questionnaire

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
well-composed.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
This is the information

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
that a person provides about himself

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and which you want to receive

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
directly from a person.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Usually, it consists of several sheets

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
and many questions are discussed there,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
including financial obligations

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
that a person has.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It is clear that if a person

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
pays a loan

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
for some mortgage

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
more than you will pay per month,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
then the question arises

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
where he gets the money.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
In this questionnaire,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
when you form it,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
make sure that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
the person gave you this information

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
voluntarily and does not object

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
to checking the information.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
The person must sign it.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Keep in mind that there is an article

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
on dismissal of a person

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
under the Labor Code

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
for false information.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
What information is collected?

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Information on violations

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
and crimes.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
You are interested in

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
whether a person was ever

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
involved in administrative

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
violations or crimes.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
It is clear whether a person

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
was ever involved in criminal crimes.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Whether he was on the wanted list,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
whether he was a criminal,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
and so on.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Again,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
it is not necessarily

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
bad, it is definitely good.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
However,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
if you take a driver

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
and see that he was involved

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
10 times in violation of the speed limit,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
2 times in the abuse

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
of alcohol,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
then it is clear

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
that it is better not to take such a driver.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I am saying that a smart person

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
will not be caught.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
He is punished for what?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Not for what he did,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
but for what he got caught.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Therefore, it is better not to take people

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
for criminal responsibility

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
or for administrative violations.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Although all this is very individual

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
and subjective.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
First, we look at the direction

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
in which we collect information.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Financial obligations.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I have already said

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
financial obligations.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Now, unfortunately,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
very common,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
unfortunately,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
fortunately,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
are loans,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
consumer loans,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
mortgages, and so on.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
This is not good

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
from the point of view of security.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
If a person has accumulated a huge amount

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
of financial obligations,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
it is clear that he must pay.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
He can commit illegal actions

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
precisely because he has nothing to return.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Let's say,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
a connection with competitors.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It is clear that you are interested

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
whether this Cossack is not sent

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and whether he is not satisfied

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
with your organization,

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
with some illegal goals

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
that his competitors

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
have set up.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
They look at the connection

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
with the organization of crime.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
With the organization of crime.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Again, from the point of view

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
of the threat that this person poses

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
if he has some kind of

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
extensive connection with the organization of crime.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
It can be both a threat and not a threat.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Again, this information is simply collected.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Then it must be analyzed

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
and some decisions are made.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
It is analyzed from the point of view

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
of some amoral actions.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Amoral actions.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
The concept of amoral actions

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
is quite subjective.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
But, as a rule,

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
there is a classical approach,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
a classical interpretation of these things.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
It is related to drunkenness,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
to some unmarried relationships

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
and everything else.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The connection is analyzed

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
with some organizations.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
It can be the most diverse organization.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Good or bad organizations.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Of course, from the point of view

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
of threats.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
If you take a person

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
and you get information

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
that he is connected

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
with some nationalist movements,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
with the Kinheads,

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
with something else.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Why do you need extra problems?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Here, from the point of view

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
of some religious views,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
it is evaluated

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
from the classical point of view

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
of religion, it is good.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
As a rule, people do not

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
commit any illegal actions.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Although there are some religious

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
movements that can harm

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
your company.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
It is analyzed

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
from the point of view

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
of a person's psychological features.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Psychological features.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I have already talked about them

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
when I talked about the relationship

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
between work and psychologists.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Relative relationships are analyzed.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Under the relative relationship

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
you can include many things.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
This is the relationship

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
between fathers and children.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
This is the relationship

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
in the family, where parents work,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
where the wife works, where the children work.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
In general, the relationship in the family

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
is based on the fact

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
that a person is in the stage of divorce.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
He is very worried.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
It is clear that in the near future

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
he will not be a worker

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
because this fact of divorce

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
can have a very strong effect on him.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
What is analyzed?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
The work in the past.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
From the point of view of committing

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
any illegal actions,

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
the reason for the dismissal is analyzed.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
In the vast majority of cases

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
in the employment book

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
they write quite classic things

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
related to the departure

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
at will or by agreement of the parties.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
90% of dismissals

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
are based on these articles.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
The security service

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
must understand the real reason

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
for the dismissal.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
A person can commit

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
some illegal actions.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
The company does not want to quarrel with him.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
To clarify the relationship,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
the company must write a statement

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
and leave.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
In fact, the person left

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
because he was kicked out.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
The material situation is analyzed.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
The material situation is analyzed

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
from the point of view of the ratio

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
of the material situation

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
and the positions of the person.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
If it is clear,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
the material situation

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
corresponds to the positions

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
of the person

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
in various organizations.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
When a person worked

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
in low-level organizations,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
in low-level positions,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
and has a very serious

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
material situation,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
the question arises why.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
There is a concept

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
of a rastro sign of danger.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
It is necessary to understand

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
why this happens.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
There is a rastro sign of danger.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
There is some kind of

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
mismatch and illogicity

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
of the situation.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
It is possible to analyze

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
the number of connections

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
with the administrative resource,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
connections with some organizations,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
the ability of this person,

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
and so on.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
The level of information

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
collected by a person

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
depends on

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
the position of this person.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
It is clear that if you take

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
a person to a position of a loader,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
you may be interested

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
only in a very small amount

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
of information about this person.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
If you take a person to a position of a top manager,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
there is a more serious level

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
of information collection

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
and verification.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
If we talk about

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
channels of information collection,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
what methods of collection are there?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
I have already said that

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
methods are limited

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
to such concepts as personal data.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Basically,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
it is what a person

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
reports himself

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
on the resume,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
on the interviews,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
on the objective materials

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
that he brings,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
such as documents,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
passport,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
employment certificate,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
and so on.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Getting information

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
on the Internet,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
that is, having typed the last name

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
of a person in various

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
search engines of the Internet,

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
you can understand or get

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
some information about this person.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
In particular,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
educational schools

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
often make graduates of a certain year

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
with photos,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
surnames,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
and the person's

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
face and school

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
where he graduated.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
This is a real experience.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
It is impossible to hide

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
the year and the school he graduated from.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Just typing his last name and his school

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
is enough to hide the year.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Using various databases.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Unfortunately,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
there are a lot of such databases.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Unfortunately or fortunately,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
illegal, semi-underground databases

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
can be supplied on the Internet

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and sold on the markets.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Unfortunately, this is an objective reality.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Our personal data

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
is not well protected.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Security services often use

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
these databases.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
It is necessary to assume that

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
this is not legal information,

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
it can be cut off,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
it can be incomplete.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
At least, if a person

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
comes to you to work,

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
he is identified by the database

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
of a lost passport,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
at least he should be guarded.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
If he does not go through

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
any database,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
it does not mean that he is white and fluffy.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
It means that you need to dig deeper.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
It can be

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
a trip to the workplace,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
a conversation with people

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
with whom he used to work

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
or with whom he used to contact.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
There are other options.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
You can make inquiries

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
to the educational institutions

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
where he graduated from.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
It is necessary to assume that

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
no one is obliged to answer these inquiries.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
This is about the reception.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
If, from the point of view of the security service,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
a person is not a threat,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
then usually it is a questionnaire

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
that is filled by the person.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
The head of the security service

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
signs that he does not object.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
If he objects,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
then this candidate does not need

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
to explain anything.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Nothing is officially written.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
The leadership of the company

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
says that, in their opinion,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
these are the reasons

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
why they do not recommend

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
hiring this person.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
However, I say again

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
that this is not an official reason for refusal.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Therefore, official papers are not written.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
This is all about

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
the reception at work.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
As for the dismissal,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I will write a little here.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
The dismissal of employees.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
The security service also

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
widely applies

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
the reasons

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
for dismissal.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Of course, it is necessary

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
to look at the level

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
of the person who is dismissed.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Basically,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
what is applied

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
and what is recommended.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
It is necessary to find out

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
the real reasons for dismissal.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
This is a very important point.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
The reason for dismissal

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
is not a person's

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
personality.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
The real reasons for dismissal

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
are the following.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
One thing is that he found a job

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
closer to home and paid more.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
This is one thing.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
If he leaves because

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
he is being eaten up by the team,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
the moral and psychological climate,

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
or maybe he leaves because

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
he did something and is trying

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
to replace the traces,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
this is completely different.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
The real reasons for dismissal are

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
trying to find out

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
the future job.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
The amount of information

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
of this person is known.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I have already said

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
that it is necessary

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
to start from the worst.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
The worst thing

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
is that the person

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
can tell everything

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
he knows.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
For money or not,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
this is another question.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Unfortunately, it is objective reality

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
that he can tell everything.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Therefore, as a rule,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
everything that a person knows

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
comes from the worst.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
The risks associated

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
with the disclosure of this information

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
are minimized.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
The activity in the unit

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
from which a person leaves

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
is analyzed.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Was there any problem

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
associated with some kind of disappearance,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
loss, theft, and so on?

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Again, this is a reason

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
why a person is dismissed.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
He wants to replace some traces.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
The instruction to a person

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
who is dismissed

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
is related to

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
trying to convince

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
a person

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
to not disclose

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
the information

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
he knew

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
in the past.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
This is a very difficult

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
and necessary

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
instruction.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
He should not

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
do

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
any illegal

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
actions

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
after dismissal.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Here is an interesting experience

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
of Americans.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
They pay money

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
to a person

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
to keep commercial secrets.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
A person is dismissed.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
He is obliged

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
not to disclose

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
the commercial secrets

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and to pay a certain amount of money

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
to keep it.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
If there are any problems

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
associated with disclosure,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
he loses some money

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
as a bonus.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
This experience is not widely used

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
in Russian companies.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
However, it is not prohibited.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
It can be done without any problems.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
To inform

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
the employees

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
who work with a person

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
that he is dismissed

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
and he is dismissed

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
and that he does not work

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
with us anymore.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
If you want to contact him,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
you can.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
No one forbids you

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
to drink vodka with him.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
However, it is not allowed

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
to disclose confidential information.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
A company's agents

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
are informed

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
that this person

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
does not work

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
with this company anymore.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
A person can be

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
informed that

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
this person

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
does not work with this company anymore.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
They can disclose some information

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
and do some actions

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
because they remember

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
that this person

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
worked with them.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
It is necessary to check

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
that a person did not take

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
any databases,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
any electronic devices,

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
any access codes,

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
any passwords,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
any cryptos, etc.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Usually,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
the environment

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
in which this person

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
was in contact

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
is analyzed.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
It means that the employees

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
of the company

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
who worked with him

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
were in close relations.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
It can be a friendship,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
a love relationship,

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
or a relationship

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
with a company.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
The approach to these people

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
is a certain work.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
It is mainly

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
preventive measures.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
If a person wants

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
to get information,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
he will contact

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
the people

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
he used to be in close relations with.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Then there is an instruction

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
not to disclose

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
any information.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
I would like to add

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
that the responsibility

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
of the employees

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
of the company

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
for various illegal actions

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
is related to this.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
The list of illegal actions

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
can be very long.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
The responsibility

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
can be different.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I will focus on one problem

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
that is related to the person,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
to the work of the security service

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
and to the personnel

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
of the company.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
It is the disclosure

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
of information

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
that is a commercial secret.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
What can be done

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
with a person

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
who disclosed

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
commercial secrets?

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
The responsibility can be different.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I will try to write it down.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Here is a situation.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
One of the situations

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
is the disclosure

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
of information

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
that is a commercial secret.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
I will call it KT.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
It is a classic abbreviation.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
It is a commercial secret.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
What responsibility

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
does a person

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
who disclosed a commercial secret have?

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
The responsibility can be different.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
The simplest thing

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
that can be done

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and is quite realistic

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
is disciplinary responsibility.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Disciplinary responsibility.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Here we need

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
to start from different points.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
There is a concept

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
of a commercial secret regime.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
A commercial secret regime

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
is created at the enterprise.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
It assumes certain actions of the employee.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
In case of violation of the employee's norms

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
and requirements,

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
he can be brought to disciplinary responsibility.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
According to the Labor Code,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
it is a complaint,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
a reprimand.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Here we are not talking

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
about the disclosure of a commercial secret.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
The information has not gone anywhere,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
no damage has been done,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
but for the violation of the commercial secret regime.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
It is used very simply,

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
very easily and quite calmly.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
The most important thing is

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
that the commercial secret regime was created

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
and that the employees

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
knew what it consisted of

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
and knew their responsibilities

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
within the framework of the commercial secret regime.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
It can be

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
disciplinary prosecution,

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
it can be a deprivation of bonus,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
it can be a reprimand,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
it can be a complaint,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
and so on.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
It can be a dismissal.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
A dismissal

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
can also be a disciplinary prosecution.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Nevertheless,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
in the Labor Code,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
both in the old,

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
the new and the completely new,

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
it is prescribed.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
For the disclosure of a secret

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
by the law,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
various types of secrets are listed,

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
including the commercial secret.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
The employee can be fired.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
This is a dismissal

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
on the initiative of the employer.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I have never encountered

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
a person being fired on this article.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
For various reasons.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
First, you need to have very strong

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
evidence of the person's guilt

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
to fire him on this article.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Because a person can

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
appeal to court after a while.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
In our case, the court usually

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
stands on the side of the employee,

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
not on the side of the employer.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And the employer will need

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
to have very strong evidence

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
why the person was fired on this article.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I have no idea

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
where a person can go

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
if he was fired

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
on the basis of a commercial secret.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
If it is a record

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
of a labor book,

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
then it is a wolf's ticket

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
that the person will not go anywhere.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Therefore, I would not recommend

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
to abuse this.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
And usually, if it is a disclosure of information,

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
people still go to other articles.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
The classic option is

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
either consent of the parties

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
or a disclosure of information

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
on their own will.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Nevertheless, if a person has already

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
disclosed all the secrets,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
then he can be fired.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
This is the kind of article

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
that exists.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
What else is the responsibility?

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
There is a property responsibility.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
There is a property responsibility.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
According to our legislation,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
that is, according to the law

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
on commercial secrecy

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
and according to the Civil Code,

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
there is a full property responsibility

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
for the damage

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
caused by the disclosure of a commercial secret.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
However, it is necessary to assume

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
that it is quite difficult

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
to prove and to investigate

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
because everything that concerns

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
the damage caused by the disclosure

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
of a commercial secret is usually a lost benefit.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
There is a real damage,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
there is a lost benefit.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
The real damage

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
is usually very minimal.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
It can be the cost of a piece of paper

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
that was taken out of the enterprise

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
and a formula was written on it.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
The real damage can be a penny.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Everything else is, in fact,

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
a lost benefit.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
The contracts, contracts,

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
agreements are broken, and everything else.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
It is almost impossible

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
to compensate for a lost benefit

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
according to our judicial system.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Therefore, it is necessary to assume

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
that if the information has leaked,

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
then, as a rule,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
all that concerns the property responsibility

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
is very difficult to implement.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Therefore, everything that concerns

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
the protection of information,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
including that of a person,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
must be done in advance.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
As soon as this happens,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
it is already quite difficult

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
to do anything.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Although, according to the law,

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
property responsibility is provided.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
There is criminal liability.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Criminal liability.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Criminal liability is provided

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
for disclosure of commercial secrets.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Keep in mind

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
that this is a criminal act.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
This is a crime.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Disclosure of commercial secrets

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
to the company's employees

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
is a crime,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
not even a violation of the law.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
This is not administrative liability,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
but criminal liability.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Although there are a lot of subtleties

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
and nuances here.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
This is an article

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
This is an article

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
It has a certain feature.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
It is basically applied,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
but in some situations

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
it is very difficult.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I will try to explain these things now.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
of the Russian Federation

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
In order to understand

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
why Article 183 of the Criminal Code

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
consists of such a large number of articles,

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I will explain it to you.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Although Article 183 of the Criminal Code

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
consists of four parts,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
it is necessary to understand

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
how the disclosure of commercial secrets

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
to the enterprise takes place.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Basically, the disclosure goes

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I will try to draw here

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
The disclosure goes

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
through

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
through

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
through

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
through

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
through

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
through

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
through

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
through

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
through

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
your own

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
through your own

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
through your own

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
through others

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
through your own

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
That is, you entrusted your

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
commercial secrets to the employee

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
within the framework of

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
the fulfillment of your

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
official duties.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
He works with your

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
own.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Therefore, as a rule, all the work

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
on the protection of

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
disclosure of commercial secrets

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
through your own, it goes

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
through the motivation of the staff,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
that is, so that the person does not want to

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
disclose the commercial secrets.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
If he wants to disclose them,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
well, as a rule, he will disclose them.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
That is, it must be done so that he does not want to do it.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
So, disclosure through others

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
is, let's call it

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
disclosure through people

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
who did not trust your commercial secrets.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
That is, you do not give them access.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
But they, having hacked some of your

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
protection funds, they got access to this information.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
And basically everything

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
regarding the mechanism, algorithm,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
let's say, protection of commercial secret

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
is, as a rule, protection

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
from strangers, not from their own, but from strangers.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
So,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
based on this, I will just try

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
to draw why

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Article 183 of the Criminal Code

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
consists of four

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
parts and why

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
some parts are used, and some

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
parts are practically not used.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
So, the first part

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
of this article

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
183 of the Criminal Code,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I will just read it a little more thoroughly.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
For collecting information

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
consisting of commercial or bank secrets

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
by stealing documents, bribery

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
or threat, in an equally

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
illegal way in order to disclose

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
or illegally use this information,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
a fine of up to 80 thousand rubles is provided

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
or a fine of up to 6 months

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
for the amount of the income of the convict,

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
or a term of up to 2 years for deprivation of freedom.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
So, what is the first part?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
First of all,

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
let's draw it like this,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
it is protection from strangers.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
So,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
these are some people

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
whom you did not trust

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
with your commercial secrets,

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
they committed some illegal actions.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Here, some illegal actions

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
are listed,

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
such as stealing documents, bribery, threat,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
in an equally illegal way.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Here, as a rule,

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
it is easy to prove.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Easy to prove.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
That is,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
the illegal way is easy enough

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
to prove, because it usually

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
leaves certain traces.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Here,

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
what is good in this part,

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
the first one,

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
is that there is no connection with damage.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
No connection with damage.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
That is,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
a person can break

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
some of your access systems,

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
steal commercial secrets,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
not to sell them to anyone,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
that is, no damage has been done,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
the information has not gone anywhere

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
further, the criminal has not gone.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
All crimes are already considered legal,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
and, in principle, you can bring to justice

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
in a day the responsibility for part 1 of this 183 article.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Here.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Well,

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
let's say,

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
all that follows from this is a fine

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
and up to 2 years.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
This is the part that actually works,

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
which is applied, although

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
everything is limited by fines.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
As far as I know,

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
the deprivation of freedom

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
if there were, then only conditionally.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
But, nevertheless, this is the part that

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
is applied and which can really

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
work.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
The second, third, and fourth part

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
is, in general, protection from your own.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
The second part of this

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
183 article.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Illegal disclosure or use of information

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
that constitutes a commercial tax

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
or a bank secret without the

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
consent of the owner of the person

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
to whom it was known or became known

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
by service or work is punished

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
by a fine of up to 120 thousand rubles

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
or in terms of salary or new income

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
of the defendant for a period of up to

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
one year with the deprivation of the right

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
to occupy a certain position or to engage

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
in a certain activity for a period of up to

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
three years or deprivation of freedom

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
for a period of up to three years.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
So, this part,

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
in fact, is protection

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
from your own.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
From your own.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
That is, you entrusted a person

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
with your commercial secrets,

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
he took on the obligation to keep

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
your commercial secrets, but, let's say,

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
somewhere he talked, somewhere he told,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
and there was a leak

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
of confidential information.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
So, here

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
what else is there to talk about?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Again, there is no connection

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
with damage.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
That is, it is not tied to the fact

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
that there must be a certain damage.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
That is, we are talking about the very fact

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
that we are keeping the commercial secrets,

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
the disclosure, we are keeping the confidential laws.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And here,

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
what else is special?

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
There is usually no mind.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Why not? Because the next part

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
is just about those situations

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
when the mind already exists.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And if you write the first part

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
further, you can say

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
that there is always a mind.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Because, let's say,

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
blackmail, bribery,

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
hacking of some safes, threats,

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
they usually do not exist without mind.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
So, the second part

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
is that there is no mind.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
That is, you can attract a person

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
to this part when, as a rule,

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
when he accidentally disclosed

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
the commercial secrets.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
That is, he has no mind,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
no interest.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
I already gave this example at the beginning,

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
when you bring the person you need

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
to a restaurant, give him a drink,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
and he will tell you about the commercial secrets.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Yes, this is already a criminal act,

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
but there is no mind here,

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
so it is about the second part,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Article 183.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And if we talk

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
in response,

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
all these fines are clear,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
and if we talk about the deprivation of freedom,

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
up to three years.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
So, the third part

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
of Article 183

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
is also a defense against one's own.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
The same actions

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
that have caused major damage

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
or committed out of interest

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
are punished with a fine of up to 200,000 rubles

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
or in the amount of salary

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
or income of the defendant

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
for a period of up to 18 months

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
with the deprivation of the right

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
to occupy a certain position

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
or to engage in a certain activity

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
for a period of up to three years

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
or deprivation of freedom

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
for a period of up to five years.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
So, what is the feature here?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
The defense against one's own.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
The defense against one's own.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
So, there is a connection

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
with damage.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
There should be major damage.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Major damage

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
or out of interest.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Out of interest.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Out of interest.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
There should be a certain intention.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Roughly speaking,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
if a person gives information

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
and gets a monetary reward

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
in return,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
it falls under the third part

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
of Article 183.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
And here,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
what else

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I could say?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I would like to emphasize

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
that this is evidence.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
As a rule,

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
everything related to evidence

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
in this article

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
is carried out in such a way

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
that the evidence is not visible

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
or, as a rule,

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
it is of interest.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
So, what are the options?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
The security service

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
has information

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
that they want to get

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
the commercial secrets.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
The security service

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
may have different activities.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
It may be some kind of

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
preventive conversation.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
What can be more serious?

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
We do everything

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
to get it to the court.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
This is also a certain installation,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
a certain decision.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Then this person is given

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
to get the commercial secrets.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
He is not detained at the checkpoint.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
The security service

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
is not detained at the checkpoint.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
All the evidence is not refutable.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
All this is recorded on video,

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
on audio.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
All this becomes evidence of the basis.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Some kind of interest

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
is traced here.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
The fourth part

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
of Article 183

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
is also protection

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
from one's own.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
It is about the same actions

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
as part 2 or 3

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
of the current article,

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
which have serious consequences

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
and punish with a free sentence

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
up to 10 years.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
This is protection from one's own.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And this should be

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
serious consequences.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Well,

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
serious consequences

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
when the commercial secret is disclosed

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
is a rare phenomenon.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Here it is up to 5 years.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Although it can be assumed

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
that the serious consequences

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
are all that is related to death.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
These are the things.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
If it happened,

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
then up to 10 years.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
In practice,

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
part 1 is used,

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
part 3 is used.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
When there is a good interest,

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
it is usually done

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
so that the evidence

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
for the court is not refutable.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Part 4 and 2 are used very rarely.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Unfortunately,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
it is used quite difficultly.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
At least this is one of the cases

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
in one of the directions.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Responsibility of the company's employees

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
is a very important issue.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
What can be done

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
to prevent certain illegal actions?

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
In particular,

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
we have considered the issue

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
of the disclosure of commercial secrets.
