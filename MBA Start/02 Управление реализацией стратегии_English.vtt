00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.920
Let’s talk about how to do the decomposition

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.000
of strategic business goals

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.740
in general and go to the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.480
map of structural units.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.320
If we have about 20 goals on the corporate

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.200
map, then decomposition we start with the

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.800
projection of the staff and the projection

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.520
of the business process.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.560
As a rule, all the goals we have stated

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.500
in the business process

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.060
projection are subject to so-

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.340
called decomposition.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.160
We reflect on the activities,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.840
projects that need to be

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.360
implemented to these goals,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.840
as well as the principles that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.100
need to be followed in order

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.080
to these goals.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.900
A small example.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.740
Let us go back to the company that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.900
works in the kitchen furniture market.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.360
In the business process section, they

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.440
have a goal that sounds like improving

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.280
the quality and functionality of products.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.460
At the stage of strategic

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.220
planning, it was decided that

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.960
there are 6 main ideas that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.620
will contribute to the level

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.980
of product quality and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.900
functionality will increase.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.620
The company is going to implement the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.920
quality management methods of the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.900
6C system.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.240
There is such a fashionable 6C

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.780
system, some thoughts the company

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.880
seems very good, it is going to implement it.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.240
To improve the quality and functionality

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.500
of products in this business, it

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
is important that the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.560
production personnel are interchangeable.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.820
The third point is important for rapid implementation

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.200
of innovation.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.080
The company does not invent innovation

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.460
itself, it is actively learning from

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.720
Italians, Germans, Scandinavians and

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.160
is trying to quickly master it.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.940
It is clear that you need to use

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.900
high-quality components for

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.260
high quality and functionality of the product.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.460
Furthermore, the company

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.000
needs high-tech equipment with

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.360
a high degree of automation.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.800
On the production site where this

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.500
is all produced, it already

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.640
exists, but you need to

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.160
put this equipment on two

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.600
new production sites.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.240
In addition, the company is going to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.100
develop a corporate production standard

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.840
in which all the nuances of the manufacturing

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.280
of the product will be prescribed

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.060
as detailed as possible and will

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.540
be indicated the typical or

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.100
most common mistakes that employees

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.420
at different stages of the manufacturing

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.780
of the product can make and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.020
which can ultimately affect the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.200
quality and functionality

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.400
of the finished kitchen.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.400
The goal of improving the quality

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.500
and functionality of the product

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.000
was essentially broken down into

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.820
half-purposes, which can be called

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.140
events, tasks, projects and principles.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.800


00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.580
The second example, the same company,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.100
also the business process designers,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.520
the goal is stated as building

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.080
a strong brand, but the brand can

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.300
be defined as a competitive idea and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.940
the company is trying to sell its customers

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.580
ethyline along with its own furniture

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.860
and promote it in every way stands

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.380
out Italianity and here

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.980
is one of the principles

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.120
stated in the system of the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.380
event is the bet on Italianity.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.300
Channels of communication with customers

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.000
are also prescribed, this is a advertising

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.800
video on TV, advertising on radio,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.000
a fairly important importance

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.460
gradually gains for the company

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.920
advertising on the Internet, advertising

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.920
in the media, in addition some money

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.300
will be spent on outdoor advertising

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.420
and brand booklets plus catalogues.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.300
Plus, the site that the company has

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.620
at the moment is hopelessly obsolete

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.600
and the company is going to

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.640
rebuild it, invest in this money,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.940
considering it a very important

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.020
tool that contributes

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.680
to building a strong brand.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.500
This is how the business decomposition

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.780
aims to build a strong

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.920
brand.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.740
This slide presents a cut-out

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.000
of their map of goals and business

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.860
level indicators in general.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.920
You can see that the goal of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.680
increasing the value of a business

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.400
is monitored through an indicator

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.700
of the size of equity.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.960
What is the value of

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.300
own capital at a given time.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.780
The goal of increasing profit

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.300
is monitored through the indicator

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.360
of economic profit.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.340
The goal of increasing customer

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.680
satisfaction is tracked by two indicators.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.540
This is a comprehensive index

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.980
of customer satisfaction, they offer

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.480
customers to fill out a questionnaire.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.740
The main factors have been listed.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.960
It is quality and functionality,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.520
design and end-to-end, service

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.260
support, timing, how the salon works,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.280
all the main factors.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.940
The second indicator that the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.080
company uses to monitor the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.220
target is the number of complaints

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.060
from customers.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.320
If you go down below, business

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320
processes in particular have the goal

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.900
of increasing the speed of order execution,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.500
the indicator here is also quite

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.820
clear, the average time of

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.000
order execution.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.380
Here they have another indicator, not

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.620
specified, is the number of orders

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.720
delivered on time.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.120
We promised customers such a

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.440
deadline, there is some amount that

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.760
we managed to fulfill in the agreed

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.240
time, there is a number of orders

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.500
that we were not able to fulfill

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.480
in the agreed time.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.500
Another goal of business processes is the

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.140
implementation of design and technological

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.840
innovations, the number of these

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.980
innovations that have been implemented.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.240
The expansion of the salon network

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.920
is monitored through two indicators,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.480
deviation from the schedule, opening

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.540
of salons and budget.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.800
The main indicator is the percentage

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.480
of occupation by competent

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.300
personnel, well, and the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.040
last one goal is to increase

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.720
the satisfaction of staff,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.200
there are two indicators,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.180
also quite understandable,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.140
the satisfaction index

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.720
as ahead, the flow as behind.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.040
On this slide you can see that the company

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.480
links the system of goals and indicators of

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.260
the business level in general with the organization

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.040
structure.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.860
The structure of a large

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.720
cell consists of four units.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.220
This division, which is headed

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.400
by the financial director of the

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.600
abbreviation FEDE, is

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.640
the division that heads the director

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.980
of production, he has in subordination

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.920
all production, all logistics,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.860
design, as well as the

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.080
service center.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.340
The marketing director in this

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.200
company leads the marketing

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.500
and sales function that is

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.640
carried out in the salons.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.120
And finally, the company

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.300
has a HR HR HR manager.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.000
The crosses in this matrix

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.480
indicate that the structural

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.660
unit bears some responsibility

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.580
for the good or bad value

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.760
of a particular indicator.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.720
Two crosses mean that the

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.120
responsibility for good or bad

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.640
is greater than the others.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.360
For example, the value of the own capital

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.740
of a business, to some extent,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.760
for the size of the own capital

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.960
are all responsible.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.600
All in one way contributes

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.980
to the value of own capital

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.160
increasing.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.640
But it was decided that the role

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.280
of the financial director is a little

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.540
more than the rest.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.920
The average time for execution of

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.460
orders is determined to be influenced

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.940
to some extent by the units

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.160
subordinated to the Financial

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.860
Director, and the units

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.260
subordinated to the Director

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.400
of Production, and the units

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.780
subordinated to the Director

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.840
of Marxing.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.520
The guilt or merit

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.000
of the producers is usually greater

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.300
than that of others.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.240
Therefore, we put two crosses in the column

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.580
of the DP - the director of production.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.340
Current of personnel.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.060
Unwanted flow of personnel, which

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.460
can be a problem for the company,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.760
also affects absolutely all

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.740
second-level managers.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.600
But it is decided that the main

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.280
guilt or major merit is usually

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.140
the guilt or merit of HR.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.720
In principle, this table,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.040
this matrix is a good basis for

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.340
making clear and understandable

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.500
maps of structural units.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.760
A small example of responsibility

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.740
for the importance of the

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.520
indicator of unwanted flow of personnel.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.960
Imagine a financial director

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.100
working for a company

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.820
receiving email information

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.780
from a HR manager.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.260
This is the content.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.460
The staff manager, digging on the Internet,

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.040
found on the Internet on one of

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.300
the sites a resume.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.100
An employee who works in the accounting

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.100
office, subordinate to the financial

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.640
director, she secretly from the job

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.260
of the donor is looking for a job.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.240
The tasks of HR usually include

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.400
periodically looking at the Internet

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.560
and looking for a job of an employee

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.840
of the company secretly from the

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.960
work of the dealer.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.320
So, a resume of one employee, was found

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.780
on one of the websites, she is

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.980
looking for a job.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.180
And HR makes the financial

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.380
director aware because her subordinate

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.800
tries to find a job secretly

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.240
from the donor’s job.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180
The financial director calls a subordinate

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.100
and asks, Masha, we found your

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.920
resume on the Internet, you

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.620
are looking for a job secretly

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.260
from us, what happened, what is

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.860
wrong, what problems?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.920
Maisa asks if you are satisfied

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.720
with my work?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.100
The financial director says, yes,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.140
we, Masha, are very happy with

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.240
your work, you are a great guy,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.800
you do well to keep the magazine

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.220
No. 7, which we have commissioned

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.680
you, we have great plans for

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.360
you, you are our personnel

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.560
reserve, we hope that you will

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.300
be very good and continue

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.640
to develop in our company.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.360
Masha asks, and please tell

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.740
me, here is the level of salary

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.540
that I am offered,

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.920
how much does it, in your opinion,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.640
compensate for my efforts?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.260
The financial director says,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.580
sorry, Masha, but I don't believe

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.620
if your levels are currently

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.820
on the market, if you don't have

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.340
enough, then why didn't you

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.080
come and tell me that I miss,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.560
I think I should earn more,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.860
I would gladly raise your salary,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.080
but you should have told

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.220
me about it, I believe

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.300
that if people don't

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.400
ask, then they, in principle,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.580
all are satisfied.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.800
And Masha says that my mom and

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.300
dad brought me up differently,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.820
they told me that you should not

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.360
ask, you should work well, employers

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.900
should see it and value

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.680
it and add, but you should

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.460
not ask.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.020
And Masha says it’s easier for

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.600
me to quit the company than to ask for it.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.440
Well, what she actually did, she has

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.480
already agreed with another employer,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.880
she was promptly raised her

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.620
salary there, tried to raise

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.500
it, but she has already left.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.980
And the CEO is in a very bad mood

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.060
because the future financial director

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.540
has left, he also had great hopes

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.940
for Masha, he thought that it was

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.800
the future financial director,

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.240
and here is the question of who

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.420
should be shot in this situation,

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.260
the financial director or HR,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.480
whose fault is more in that this

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.140
employee left the company.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.840
You can conclude, probably, that

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.380
the fault was both, I think that

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.840
the task of HR is not just

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:42.960
to sit on the internet

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.740
and look where to whose resume

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.380
hangs.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.420
Ideally, HR should have drawn a portrait

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.480
of Masha for her immediate

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.500
manager, say the financial

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.820
director, but keep in mind

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.660
that Masha is specific

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.640
to us, she won’t ask.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.180
And second, the level of wages in the

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.960
market for such specialists is about

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.060
that, decide yourself, it is your

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.340
resource, your budget, if you think

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.880
it is necessary to make wages higher,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.300
do it, if you think it is not

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.060
necessary, do not do it.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.380
But I told you in time that the portrait

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.640
is like this, the salaries are like this.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.000
If HR did all this, there would

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.380
probably be no claims to him

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.540
on this indicator, but in this

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.640
situation there are obviously

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.120
questions to both

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.260
and to the direct manager,

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.380
who must deal with their

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.940
resources, budget including,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.040
and to HR, who helps

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.020
functional managers

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.160
to do so.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.920
In the next slide, I want to show

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.840
you an example of a system of objectives

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.900
and indicators of a factory that

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.620
is part of a

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.280
large machinery enterprise.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.300
The head of the factory has an

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:59.500
A4 paper with 12 key indicators

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.200
in front of his eyes.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.420
One of the indicators, financial

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.700
indicator, is the indicator of

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.020
sales profitability.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.520
A few words about the specifics of this plant.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.900
Almost all the products produced

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.140
at this plant are consumed as

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.500
part of the group, as part of the calling,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.380
and domestic prices are

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.460
prescribed by the central headquarters.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.060
The director of the factory is told

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.560
that the products produced in your

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.000
factory are sold within the group

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.320
at such prices.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.840
If your costs are lower,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.240
you make a profit.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.100
If you have real costs that are

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.980
higher than the prices we brought

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.440
you from the headquarters,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.620
we have registered a loss.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.560
Some volume of products it

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.780
sells to external customers

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.760
outside the group, but small.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.460
The planned value of the profitability

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.900
of sales, the share of the internal profit

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.360
in the internal revenue, was 10%,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.860
in fact we see that it turned out

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.420
to be 8%, in fact they could only make 8%.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.460
That is, the actual costs incurred

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.640
at this plant were slightly higher

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.400
than planned.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.060
Prices are fixed, they are

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.300
the same as planned.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.900
But the costs were large, so the value

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.420
of the profitability of sales in fact

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.440
turned out to be less.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.480
In the project, the customers three indicators

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.920
- the number of complaints per 100

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.760
deliveries, the number of new customers

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.160
that were able to attract, and the

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.620
number of terminated contracts, customers

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.760
who left, ceased to

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.000
be served at this plant.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.100
In the business process projection,

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.680
5 key indicators are the average delivery

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.060
time to customers in days, and the second

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.300
indicator informs about how high

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.900
the percentage of compliance with

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.480
delivery times to customers was.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.280
According to the plan, we would like the

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.120
plant to be 97 percent timely, in

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.660
fact, they even managed to do 99 percent.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.680
The third indicator at this plant

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.400
is how well the suppliers

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.140
with whom this plant works are

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.200
fulfilling their commitments

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.420
on time.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.060
A very important indicator is the share

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.020
of marriage, well, and

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.780
the indicator of

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.240
productivity, productivity, volume

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.040
production is the latest in

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.920
this projection.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.580
In the projection of the staff they monitor

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.260
three values are morbidity, traumaticity,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.080
this is traumatic production, people

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.300
can injure their hands, get

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:43.600
sick with the flu in the winter,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.000
these are undesirable phenomena, ideally

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.080
no more than 5% of working time

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.620
is lost because of the fact that

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.320
people have become sick or have

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.860
some kind of injury.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.240
Staff outflow and

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.380
satisfaction are two

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.460
indicators that add to the morbidity.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.920
The arrow indicators you

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.520
see in the second column

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.520
tell us whether the

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.820
indicator is upward

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.060
or downward.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.860
Or the more, the better, as with

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.060
sales profitability, new

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.720
customers, or customer delivery

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.140
deadlines, or the less,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.100
the better.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.980
This is the number of complaints per 100

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.000
deliveries, the flow of personnel, the share of marriages.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.740
The third column contains the planned

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.220
values for a certain period.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.400
Then we see the fact, the actual meaning.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.420
And a very interesting third column uses

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.020
such a value as the degree of

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.340
achievement of the goal.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.080
How close we are to the goal

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.120
that hangs.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.240
As if we had 12 carrots hanging

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.580
high enough above us, and

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.620
we must reach out to each

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.560
of them.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.460
How much we jumped, how

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.580
much we reached, was not enough.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.140
This is by this third column

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.360
- the degree of achieving the

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.800
target value.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.540
Profitability of sales according to the

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.820
plan - 10%, in fact, it was possible to perform

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:22.360
by 8%, respectively, the degree

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.740
of achieving the target value - 80%.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.380
The number of advertisements per 100 deliveries.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.940
Either we were told, or we

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.120
agreed with the higher management

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.420
this amount, no more than

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.940
three complaints per 100

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.320
deliveries, but in fact it

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.480
was four.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.860
The customer has sent 4 complaints.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.700
Accordingly, the rate of achievement of

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.680
the target will be 67% if rounded.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.800
But we can find in this list

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.810
the values that have been overcrowded,

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.120
such as the number of new

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.040
customers.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.820
The agreed goal is 10 new customers

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.300
over the period.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.920
The company has managed to attract

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.880
12 new customers.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.780
Over-performance - 120% performance,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.520
the same with respect to delivery

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.720
times to customers.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.100
The target value is 97% of deliveries

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.360
exactly on time, in fact 99% of

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.420
the deliveries we have

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.640
managed to do, we record the

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.920
102% value in the third column.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.620
Disease of staff.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.780
We wanted that no more than 5%

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.720
of the total working time fund

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.220
should be spent on simple,

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.080
sick time.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.080
In fact, we got worse, 8% and

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.400
half of the working time was

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.940
lost because people were sick.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.420
Accordingly, in the third column, we

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.620
consider the degree of achieving

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.920
the target value very small, 30%.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.720
The carrots hanged high enough,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.260
we jumped, but not very high.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.740
What next?

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.120
Then you can simply add these 12 values to

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.860
divide by 12, to calculate the average

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.020
value according to the degree of

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.920
achievement of the goals.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.100
The average is 81.3 if you

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.900
simply add all these values

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.380
and divide by 12, to count

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.220
the average.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.900
You can a little differently, it is probably

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.440
more interesting, you can take into account

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.860
the weights.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.960
It can be assumed that not all indicators

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.660
are equally significant, not all

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.400
have the same weight, not all are

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.680
equally heavy, or all are

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.420
equally light.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.200
There is something easier, there is something heavier.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.920
For example, on this slide we see a version

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.500
with weights.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.940
Such the most important, most important

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.500
indicators are recognized as profitability

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.840
of sales, its weight of 0.15, the number

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.140
of complaints per 100 deliveries from

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.600
customers also weighs 0.15, compliance

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.980
with delivery times to customers in

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.820
percentage also weighs 0.15, the

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.000
share of marriages also came into this

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.400
list, such very important indicators.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.320
All other indicators are important,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.640
have some weight, but it is

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.780
slightly smaller, but the sum

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.780
should be a unit.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.040
And then we weave the column SDC, the

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.040
degree of achievement of the goals, weigh

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.160
the column weight and fold in the third column.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.120
The degree of achievement of goals with

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.700
the weight being taken into account is

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.660
slightly less than in the previous slide,

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.700
there we got 81.3, here we get 80 with

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.800
the pennies.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.140
So, looking at this slide,

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.380
we see that the plant has achieved

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.400
80% of the performance

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.880
that was set out or agreed

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.240
with it at the strategic

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.140
planning stage.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.340
Because, as a rule, we write goals

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.720
for structural units on the principle

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.620
of road with bilateral movement,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.780
on the principle of bottom-

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.980
up, bottom-up and on the principle

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.880
of top-down, top-down, it is a very

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.380
important moment for the employees

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.560
of structural units to

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.580
participate in the development

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.160
of the goals they will, they are

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.120
a little different then to this

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.820
relate that most people

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.000
feel bad if they are married

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.180
without their NATO consent.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.180
If an employee was called to the

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.220
stage of the development of goals,

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.000
at least he heard his opinion, even

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.900
if he left with the opinion imposed

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.180
on him from above, but he at least

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.960
spoke, he at least heard, he will

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.040
have a slightly different

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.900
attitude toward the goals

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.360
he should.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.740
And so we see that the factory,

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.740
headed by a certain person,

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.900
has achieved the goals set for

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.620
it at 80%.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.240
With only 12 parameters, we try

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.380
to look at this plant from all sides.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.740
A convenient format of visualization, it

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.860
is not a table, but a chart.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.740
And in particular, this factory

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.960
uses such a web that I

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.680
would like to offer

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.800
your attention.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.860
All the same indicators are not

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.440
in a table, but in the form

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.600
of a diagram, or as they call it a web.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.320
Ideally, this line should go

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.720
through 100%, ideally, each

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.480
indicator is done at 100%,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.820
ideally, we jumped and got

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.480
every carrots that hanged

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.660
high enough.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.040
Somewhere we even jumped over

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.860
the carrots on two indicators,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.840
somewhere we performed at a fairly

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.380
high percentage, somewhere we had failures.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.800
The deeper the curve bends inside

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.800
to zero, the worse, the more

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.180
the head of the unit

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.420
should be alert.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.600
We see that there were quite

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.920
serious failures with

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.520
the morbidity of staff, too

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.920
much working time was

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.200
lost because people were

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.420
sick or injured.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.940
We see that the marriage was not

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.780
so good, the curve is far

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.560
enough from 100%, the delivery

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.400
time of the suppliers was

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.380
not so good.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.840
There were sizes where the factory worked well.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.800
It’s just a visualization

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.720
tool, but since most people

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.080
are visual, they want to

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.740
look not on a tablet, but

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.140
on some graphics, for example.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:25.880


00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.950
It is logical to assume that the system

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.930
of objectives and indicators of the

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.550
structural unit should be bound by

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.410
the system of wages.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.970
So, the work of the structural

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.210
unit of this plant as

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.970
part of a large

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.410
machinery enterprise we control

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.990
on 12 key indicators.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.670
Reporting can be submitted in the form

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.290
of a web, in the form of a table, and

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.490
in addition to the fact that we

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.370
link the system of purposes

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.050
and indicators of the reporting

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.570
system, we usually link it with

00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.850
the system of pay.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.610
The system of wages for

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.530
the general director of this

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.650
factory, the head of this factory,

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.270
he has some fixed amount

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.950
and bonus.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.690
Let’s say the planned value

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.750
of the bonus is one thousand

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.710
conditional cash signs.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.750
This is a thousand conditional money

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.590
stamps, it will be paid if all indicators

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.390
are performed at 100%, if the SDC,

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.810
the degree of achievement of the goals,

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.150
will be 100%.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.630
If there is over-execution, it will

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.810
pay even more.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.350
Let’s assume that there was

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.830
no over-performance, but there was

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.890
a 100% performance of each indicator.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.130
Accordingly, the planned value becomes

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.810
a fact, and the bonus will actually

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.970
be one thousand.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.550
But if, as in this example, we see

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.790
that the degree of achievement

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.630
of the goals, all the goals

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.950
in the end, weighted average, not

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.350
100%, but 80%, then actually the

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.730
bonus that is paid in addition

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.830
to the fixed fee will be equal

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:06.030
to 803 euros.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.530
So, we see on this slide that the

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:13.510
value of the bonus added to

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.210
a fixed fee is tied to the achievement

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.670
of the target values of

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.230
12 indicators sorted

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.130
by four projections of

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.110
a balanced system of indicators.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.990
In any case, we must have

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.370
indicators that inform

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.070
how well the staff works,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.750
what is his qualification,

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.590
what are his competences.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:43.190
We need to have indicators

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.150
that inform us about how

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.870
fast and quality processes

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.630
in this unit are.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.710
We need to have a client

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.270
projection that allows us

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.090
to get feedback from external

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.390
customers, either from internal

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.210
or both.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.190
All structural units

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.750
are in the budget.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.130
Some structural units,

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.190
in addition to the budget of expenses,

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:07.130
have a planned value of income.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.790
Therefore, the compensation system should take

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.910
into account the value of the indicators

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.070
from all four projections.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.190
So, in order to successfully implement

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:24.450
the strategy, it is necessary

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.110
to spend time transforming it into

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.170
understandable goals and tasks

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.570
for individual employees

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.930
and structural units, to provide

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.530
indicators, to put control

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.330
points and to link the pay

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.350
system.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:46.510
One of the most controversial issues

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.770
that can be discussed at the stage of

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.410
implementation of a strategy is the question

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.490
of who in the company we explain

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.030
the business strategy.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.270
We explain this only by the second

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.890
level, whether we should descend

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.130
to the third level and whether

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.670
we should reach ordinary performers.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.150
It is clear that in a construction company,

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:16.050
the procrastinator at the construction

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.830
site cuts tasks to his subordinates every day.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:22.450
He tells the stone-makers that today we

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.550
lay a wall, the height by the end of

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.390
the day should be like this, the bricks

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.170
are placed like this, and explain

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.170
some individual nuances.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.450
To another employee he says that today

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:39.350
we are digging the depth of the trance

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:44.210
like this, the width like this, and so on.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.930
If all this is done, the compensation

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.550
at the end of the week will be the following.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.350
Cutting down tasks today somehow

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.550
contributes to the strategic

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.150
goals of the construction organization

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.750
as a whole, but should we explain

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.810
to the staff of the

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:08.890
corporate goals and why we

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.910
should act this way rather

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.410
than differently?

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.990
Why should we bypass this wall

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.030
that we see in front of us on

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.490
the left rather than on the right,

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.970
and why should we not jump over it?

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.670
If I stay with the construction

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.490
business, I remember the logic

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.540
of one of my acquaintances who

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.320
commands the construction company.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.580
He says he understands the important

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.660
strategies for business.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.640
In a competitive market, this is important.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.680
Without a clear strategy, you cannot

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.260
survive in a competitive market.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.960
But if you go down to the second

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.960
level in the hierarchy, if you come

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.660
to the chief engineer, he tells me, and

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.580
talk to him about strategy, then the

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.500
chief engineer will say that

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.140
strategy is a game that is sold

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.260
in the child’s world.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.180
He recently bought his son, and he

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.360
no longer knows and is unlikely

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.780
to guess that the strategy for business

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.680
is useful.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.260
He is unable to clearly formulate

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.020
the strategy of the construction organization

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.320
itself, although he is the chief engineer,

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.060
the second person in the company.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.720
Down to level three, we talk

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.220
with proof.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.360
Prorab, according to my friend, does

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.960
not know the word strategy at all.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.860
The chief engineer knows, but he thinks that

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.740
this is a game, and the prorab does not

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.880
know the word strategy at all.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.600
Well, finally, we are descending

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.780
to the fourth level in the hierarchy,

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.960
where, according to the CEO, the

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.880
unknown people work, so he calls

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.280
them his company.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.860
And he does not find it necessary

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.700
to explain the strategy to them because

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.920
he has an extremely low educational

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.620
intellectual level in the company,

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.320
and in addition, they are extremely disloyal.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.640
They work with him today, they move

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.980
to another place tomorrow, and then they

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.040
will come back to him again.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.220
At the construction, the reeders cut

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.220
them up tasks for today, dig from the

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.760
fence until lunch.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.420
It is clear that achieving these, fulfilling

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.140
their task, contributes to the fact

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.040
that the company achieves some goals

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.660
in the customer department or in

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.460
the finance department.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.980
But to explain the staff strategy

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.500
to the ordinary CEO in this

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.900
company is not going to.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.640
I think people are different, I

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.300
think there are people in the company

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.580
who work better if they understand

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.360
why we are still bypassing

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:35.180
the wall I think there are

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.220
some people like that in

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.960
any organization.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.340
Some of the other people are working

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.800
quite well, very well, if they

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.300
are told that we are digging today

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.920
from the fence to lunch, and why exactly

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.980
from the fence and why exactly before

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.360
lunch, why the trance is such

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.360
and not such, and how it correlates

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.380
with achieving the goal in

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.900
the client section they do

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.880
not know.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.340
But at the same time they work very

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.700
well and don’t want to bother themselves

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.520
with thinking about why we

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.400
do it.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.940
If the management of the company begins

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.300
to explain this to them, they say, don’

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.580
t waste your time, yours and ours.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.080
You tell us what we have to

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.180
do today, tomorrow or after tomorrow.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.800
But we don’t need to explain why

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.300
it is so and why it is not different,

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.040
and how it relates to higher goals.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.260
We will do everything well.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.880
But for people like that, I don’t think

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.680
you need to explain.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.400
Another thought on this topic.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.840
Once I had a discussion with my

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.840
friend who works in a company providing

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.720
communications services,

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.580
telecommunications business.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.200
We argued about whether the company’

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.380
s strategy could affect the list of

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.920
objectives and performance of

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.260
the average employee.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.480
For example, a driver who drives a boss

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.940
at one company to another, at a meeting,

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.120
takes him to the airport, meets

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.420
a boss at the airport, sometimes

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.840
throws his accounting into the bank.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.540
Such work is done.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.300
It would seem like the same thing.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.740
The first, second, third, fourth transmission,

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.160
do not drive through the holes, so that

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.160
the car does not break often,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.240
do not violate the rules of

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.420
traffic, and so on.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.660
Wherever he works, in a

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.660
business school with some

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.740
strategy, or in a

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.060
telecommunications company with

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.480
some strategy, his actions are

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.460
basically the same.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.760
And the map of goals and indicators

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.900
of this person should coincide.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.400
But after discussing, we decided that

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.140
it did not coincide to the end.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.500
A business school in this industry

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.960
can have its own strategy, it must have

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.820
its own strategy.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.540
And in this industry, a business

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.800
school may differ from other

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.300
organizations in what Western

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.920
diplomas offer on the market.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.860
Well, one of the competitive

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.380
advantages, we offer in this territory

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.340
the degree programs of serious

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.980
Western business schools.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.700
And in this business school there are

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.480
constantly some foreigners, and Swedes,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.580
and Germans, and French, and Americans.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.640
And periodically have to drive to

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.640
the airport, to meet another

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.540
foreign guest.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.520
Well, perfect, perfect English

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.000
from the driver in this company

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.280
no one demands.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.580
But asking “How was your flight?”

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.660
he is able.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.640
The driver who has come to the job

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.840
in this organization is told

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.800
“You should know English”,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.180
at least at a simple level,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.980
because our business school’s

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.140
strategy involves internationalization.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.000
That we work with Western programs,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.100
with Western diplomas, we

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.000
have a lot of foreigners in our

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.500
guests, with them we need to build

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.980
relationships.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.180
To maintain these relationships,

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.560
you are also involved in this,

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560
you periodically wander in

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.040
the airports, meet and take them

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.500
there, don’t just look at the road,

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.380
maintain a conversation, asking

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.800
“How is it?”, “How was the flight?”

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.620
and so on.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.840
You need to know English there.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.000
This is a small strategic specificity

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.100
of your work in our business.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.440
All the rest is the same, the first, second,

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.540
third transmission, do not drive through

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.160
the pit, do not break the D.D.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.260
If this person is fired from this company

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.360
and goes to work in another, in another

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.180
even industry, in telecommunications,

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.060
he will also be told there "First, second,

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.260
third, fourth transmission, do not

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.220
drive in the pitches, do not break

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.520
the D.D.", but will add that in

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.520
our industry, in our business, it

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.900
is very difficult to distinguish

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.200
from competitors.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.280
The telecommunications industry

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.060
is quite complicated in terms of inventing

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.620
differences from each other.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.960
Almost not the only way

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.640
to distinguish the company colors

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.160
and logos.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.920
In one organization in this industry red

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.160
and white colors, in another yellow

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.800
and red, and in the third - blue and green.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.600
And in one organization in

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.320
this industry there is a

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.480
small fleet of corporate cars that

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.560
are painted with

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.440
corporate colours.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.400
It is not good for the company to drive

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.580
dirty around the city.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.400
The driver’s card says “wash

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.300
the car five times a day.”

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.020
Not every day, but if the weather

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.300
is bad on the street, then he has

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.440
to wash the car 6 and 7 times a day.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.540
It is an element of marketing strategy.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.700
The popularization of brand colors, the

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.440
promotion of brand colors is one of the

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.960
important factors of competitive struggle

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.200
in this business.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.300
The driver is told that a small specificity

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.800
of strategic work in our business

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.280
is that you need to wash the car

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.560
more often.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.220
You may not know English, in another

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.260
company with a different

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.460
strategic specificity you

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.260
must know English.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.200
But in our business you can be without

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.740
language at all.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.660
But washing the car often is necessary,

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.860
and this is your small strategic specificity.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.680
To finish my spark I would like

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.420
to quote one American manager

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.300
who says that you can have a great

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.020
fantastic strategy, but if

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.260
it is not translated into understandable

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.060
for individual employees, let

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.380
the ordinary people who refuel

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.920
on the gasoline station with

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:20.000
fuel capacity and not control

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.860
this process, then all your

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.780
wonderful plans can simply be

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:32.660
in the box of the desk of

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.940
writing and not realized in practice.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.800
The most important conclusion from

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.540
our course – strategy in the company – is

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.620
the matter of everyone.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.300
The fundamental concept of the organization’

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.660
s development should be broken down into

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.700
a comprehensible package and action for

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.140
individual employees, provided

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.660
with indicators and marked

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.040
with certain control points, linked

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.060
to the reporting system and necessarily

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.980
to the incentive system.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.540
The main conclusion of this course is as follows.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.940
The company strategy, usually briefly

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.780
formulated, should be translated

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.100
into an understandable package

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.200
and action for individual employees.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.560
In companies, you can

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.160
often face problems.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.560
A sales employee comes

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.320
to the manager and says,

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.160
“Boss, I read on

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.620
the company’s internet,

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.520
our strategy is briefly

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.900
formulated, it excites

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.440
me very much, I’m two hands

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.140
for, I’ll do everything

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.480
I can to these goals,

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.760
but explain what I specifically

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.420
should and shouldn’t

00:37:58.420 --> 00:37:59.960
do in my workplace to

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.400
help the beloved

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.380
company its goals.”

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.000
Accordingly, we have to

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.540
break down the briefly formulated

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.560
strategic concept into

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.240
pieces, into component elements,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.380
into actions, events,

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.660
projects, put them as tasks in

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.940
structural units, provide

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.200
indicators so that this

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.280
can be measured, timelines and

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.380
names, and link them with the

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.340
system of reporting and necessarily

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.320
with the system of

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.680
staff incentives.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.840
I would also like to say that this

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.300
tool, which we have considered with

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.580
you, has been tested in companies

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.020
of a wide variety of industries in

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.660
the manufacturing, trade and service

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.600
sectors in recent years.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.400
It has been tested in companies

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.880
of all sizes, in large corporations,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.380
and in small hairdressers.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.980
In addition, it has been tested

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.260
in classic focused on making

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.420
profit, and in so-called non-

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.220
profit organizations

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.500
that do not seek to maximize

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.960
profit.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.480
At one conference in Germany, I managed

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.180
to listen to the head of the police

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:19.660
station in the city of Offenburg.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.820
In Germany there is such a small

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.100
town, Ofenburg, there is

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.180
a police station, a police

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.420
station, whose employees read

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.220
Guru's books on this topic decided

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.800
to make a strategic map and

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.900
a balanced system

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.720
of indicators for

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.560
their small organization.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.740
There is a specificity there,

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.720
because they cannot declare profit,

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.260
capitalization, value, revenue

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.860
in net cash flow as the ultimate

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.940
goals they are pursuing.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.280
They have the same four projections

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.980
– finance, clients, processes

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.700
and personnel, but somewhat differently linked.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.340
Finance is a budget that

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.120
should fit into.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.140
As customers, this structure understands

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.460
the inhabitants of the city

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.580
in which they exist.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.560
As if there is no competition in

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.100
this city, there is one police

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.440
station that can not work in

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.260
other cities, and police from

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.800
other cities do not come to this

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.360
city, but they want to position

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.620
you as an organization

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.800
that provides the safety, peaceful

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.620
sleep of the city’s

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.700
residents.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.560
They themselves periodically question

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.220
the inhabitants of the city,

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.780
conduct questionnaires, what is good,

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.040
what is bad in the work of the

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.260
police, what is like, what is not like,

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.680
what we could do better.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.880
There are checks from the regional center

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.780
of Stuttgart, which also ask the residents

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.340
of the city what you like in the

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.000
work of the police, what you do not like.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.540
There is a projection of the business process,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.060
there are standard values,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.480
the disclosure of crimes, the average

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.020
time of arrival of the machine to the scene

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.420
of the accident, there are some decisions

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.480
on the personnel.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.780
This tool is used not only in

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.240
classic business-oriented to profit,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.760
but also in the non-profit sector,

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.520
and non-profit sector organizations,

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.780
non-commercial structures also

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.660
benefit greatly from the tool,

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.200
as it allows you to structure

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.180
thoughts, bring them into

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.020
the system and break down

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.500
the organization’s goals

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.860
into the structural units,

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.940
linked to the reporting

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.700
system, with the staff

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.920
motivation system.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.460
I hope you can do this successfully

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.740
and successfully implement

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.340
your own strategy.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.800
Thanks for attention.
