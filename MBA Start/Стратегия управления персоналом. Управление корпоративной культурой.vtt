WEBVTT

00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.310
Good morning, dear colleagues.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.010
My name is Natalie Red.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.850
I am the Vice President

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.570
of the Moscow School of

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.990
Business.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.150
Today we are working on

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.690
the topic of HR management.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.390
In this topic, we will look at

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.630
two main blocks.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.910
This is the development of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.450
the HR strategy and corporate

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.150
culture of the company.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.460
Let us go with you to our first

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.700
slide.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.200
Thus, the construction of the personnel

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.480
management system includes the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.480
diagnosis of the personnel management

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.800
system existing in the company.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.880
It is clear that a company that exists

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.760
for more than one year, has already been

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.100
building some type of personnel

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.540
management system, which has been established

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.080
for a certain time.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.780
First, we will go through the basic

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.540
methods of diagnosis of the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.340
personnel management system.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.980
We will develop programs on the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.880
main areas of activity within the strategy.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.300
We will form a staff service and

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.080
design the main documents that are

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.520
part of the management of personnel.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.100
Why do we do this with you?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.560
What do we have as a result?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.020
Let us move to the next slide.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.440
The expected result.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.780
We have a clear, comprehensible,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.040
all-accepted strategy of human resources

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.480
management, a system of human resources

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.460
management that reflects all

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.480
the features of the company, that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.320
is, our history, our market with

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.080
you, our corporate culture.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.200
The HR management service is also

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.500
one of the tools for implementing

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.700
the strategy.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.660
Working, active service is also

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.300
one of the results of our

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.800
course with you.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.520
So what is included in the stages

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.960
of HR service?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.280
As I said, we start with a diagnosis

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.400
of the current situation in the

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.120
company.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.600
We see what is, what has happened,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.340
what we will have to operate

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.660
to build our strategies

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.700
with you.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.960
The second.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.140
Based on what is, we draw a point,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.200
and where we want to be with you.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.280
The objectives and objectives

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.420
of the HR management strategy.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.400
We define the objectives of the unit

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.160
based on the company's strategy.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.600
The next stage.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.180
We see what internal, human

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.020
resources we need to move from

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.740
the point A, where we are today,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.660
to the point B, where we want

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.040
to be with you.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.080
The next stage.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.880
We recruit staff in the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.680
structure, the functional

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.160
model that we have drawn

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.220
with you.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.760
We develop regulations, documents

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.760
and are briefly written, in

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.220
fact one of the most difficult

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.100
stages, adapting the new division

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.000
of the company's existing

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.960
system.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.740
The diagnostic areas.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.080
What we look at, determining what

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.220
strategy of personnel development,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.080
work with personnel we and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.940
you choose.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.840
Let's start with the markets.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.820
A company that works in the field

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.980
of production, in industry, it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.840
is oriented to a more conservative

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.600
strategy, more oriented to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.940
social programs in the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.840
work with personnel.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840
If we take a company working

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.540
in the IT market, there we have a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.660
more dynamic environment, a more

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.560
dynamic labour market, a more dynamic

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.280
environment, and therefore

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.560
more in our HR strategy

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.060
will be provided with personnel

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.800
development programs,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.980
team education.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.920
The motivation system will most

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.280
likely be tied to the results.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.260
The market we are in is also

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.400
closely linked to the labour

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.420
market.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.580
How competitive is the labor

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.520
market in our region, in our

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.680
industry.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.440
If the industry as a whole declined,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.560
as it was, let's say, a few years

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.140
ago in agriculture, in the

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.400
textile industry, the labour

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.140
market was uncompetitive.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.360
There could not be considerable

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.360
resources for hiring.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.140
And separately, it was possible

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.580
not to allocate this block in the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.640
HR strategy, because the employees

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.660
were in line, and there was no

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.980
special need to form the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.840
employer's brand in the labour market,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.840
and to do the rest of the quite

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.380
expensive and resources

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.060
and money things.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.140
If we talk about the same IT company'

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.900
s labour market, which I mentioned

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.240
before, where the labour

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.720
market from the very beginning

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.960
of the industry was

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.020
quite competitive, then there

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.600
is a fairly serious system

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.780
of hiring personnel.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.520
This is also the work with universities to

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.800
engage young professionals in

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.080
the formation of an external personnel reserve.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.740
It is clear that all this will require

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.220
a separate time, individual money

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.240
and individual specialists for

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.900
this work.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.160
Furthermore, what else we look at,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.420
determining where we are to sail in the framework

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.760
of human resources management, what

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.260
structure we should build and what

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.420
to pay attention to.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.280
Number of employees, number

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.580
of employees.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.440
I think it's no secret that the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.920
strategy of working with personnel

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.420
in a company with tens of

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.220
thousands of people and

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.560
several dozen employees will

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.620
be fundamentally different.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.740
The smaller the company, the more

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.760
we can afford individual

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.040
work with employees,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.320
some psychological

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.220
accompaniment.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.340
The larger the company, the more

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.600
we work with the system, not

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.600
with each individual.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.740
That is, we build the system as a

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.400
whole at once, and the larger the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.960
company, the more we will have

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.720
to formalize our internal standards,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.580
our internal procedures,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.400
our internal system.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.680
About such an important component

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.360
as organizational culture, and

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.860
how we will build a HR strategy

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.140
with you accordingly,

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.920
we will talk more in

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.000
detail in the second part.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.860
It is also very important to know

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.900
what stage of development your company

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.040
is at the moment.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.560
Everyone knows that the company goes through

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.040
certain stages in its development.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.700
First, when the company is small,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.420
everyone gathered and knew each

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.100
other, working on arrangements

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.860
without any formalized

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.520
rules, procedures of politicians.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.220
Once the company begins to

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.800
grow, the next stage of mechanization

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.980
appears.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.760
We are starting to formalize our policies

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.100
and procedures.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.420
We are beginning to fix our arrangements

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.020
in paper form.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.560
We get different levels of that

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.960
staff that is in our internal

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.580
staff service.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.440
Let us see how our staff

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.320
service develops depending on

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.020
the stage of the company's development.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.020
At the first stage of the process, we

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.560
either have no staff manager at all

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.860
in the company, or he is alone,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.440
he is called a reader, a gender,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.660
a node and a greek.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.700
That is, one person and selects, and performs

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.040
the functions of a psychologist, and

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.980
engages in training staff, and all

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.720
the things that are needed at the moment

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.760
for the company.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.060
At the mechanization stage,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.500
we begin to build the staff

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.740
service on a functional type.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.380
That is, the direction of training is separate,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.400
the selection and adaptation of personnel

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.820
are separate.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.760
In a separate block, we are starting

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.820
to get out of the production work.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.060
Depending on what strategy

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.880
we choose for our company.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.700
The next stage is internal

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.980
entrepreneurship, when we move

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.260
from the functional type to project

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.500
management and other tools

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.920
for results management

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.440
within the company.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.260
We have a comprehensive strategy

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.640
for human resources management,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.160
corporate ideologies are developed,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.120
and more affiliated tools

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.340
are attracted.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.620
By the way, at the same stage, the

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.000
HR management service usually

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.680
moves to the project management

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.700
method.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.440
A separate topic of HR and top manager and relationships.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.080
First of all, I want to draw the attention

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.620
of managers who are only planning

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.100
to take the service, take their

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.600
company such a beast as a

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.280
HR manager.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.900
What do you want to draw your attention to?

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.320
If you think that with the arrival of

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.640
a single specialist the situation

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.360
in the company will change immediately,

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.100
the rules of the game will change,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.980
it was bad, everything will be good,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.320
then, unfortunately, without a system

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.840
of regular management, without high-

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.800
level specialists in all positions

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.300
within the company, one person can

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.920
not build a competent personnel

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.800
management strategy.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.520
The rules of the game are formalized,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.000
which are determined only

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.440
by the first persons

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.900
of the company.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.700
And once you have taken a specialist

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.420
to yourself, once you have a person

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.180
responsible for working with

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.140
personnel, he has certain

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.700
roles in the company.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.500
What do you want to pay attention to?

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.360
In small companies, when a

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.820
person comes to a newly

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.460
created position, makes a staff

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.420
service structure, makes a HR management

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.040
strategy under himself, there

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.820
is a tendency to slide

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.860
into a dangerous role.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.780
The dangerous roles include

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.060
the priest, the one who hears

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.420
everyone, accepts everyone and

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.760
forgives sins.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.160
Maita is a native, a lawyer before

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.980
the administration, who walks and is

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.740
engaged in protecting employees on

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.520
the occasion and without a reason before

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.860
the administration.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.540
And the reverse role is the policeman,

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.160
the one who monitors and walks,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.760
embodies the entire power of administration

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.240
in his person.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.820
While the main roles, key roles of

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.000
the company's HR should be the HR

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.640
strategist, one who determines where

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.540
we go depending on the company's

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.400
strategy, the HR technician, that is,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.140
a specialist who knows perfectly

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.020
the technologies of human resources

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.200
management, the HR consultant, that

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.860
is, ready and able to advise people

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.480
on certain issues of human resources

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.080
management, well and the human

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.740
resources innovator, that

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.300
is, a person who knows the

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.560
main new technologies of human

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.300
resources management existing

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.660
on the market, and who can apply

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.620
them in practice.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.860
Why is more and more attention

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.360
being paid to the management

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.560
of personnel in companies?

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.400
It is no secret that the main objective

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.980
of the company's strategy and purpose

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.660
in the market has been to increase

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.500
the value of the company.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.540
This is often due to the IPO, with

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.120
accountability to shareholders.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.560
Thus, the tasks of managing personnel

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.140
significantly affect the value

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.920
indicators of the company.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.400
I would like to bring the results of

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.820
the study conducted by companies

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.560
Ecopsia and Rosexpert, the image

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.720
of the company as an employer.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.800
Here are 10 main non-financial

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.520
indicators that affect the

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.120
value of a company.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.020
I think those companies that have

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.740
already faced due diligence preparation,

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.420
the main of these indicators

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.900
are familiar.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.280
First, the implementation of the

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.020
corporate strategy.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.960
How do you monitor and monitor the implementation

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.140
of the corporate strategy?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.920
They look not at the assurance

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.700
of the management, not the statement

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.040
of the company's talk managers

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.220
that the corporate strategy is and it

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.160
is being implemented, but look

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.420
at how much the corporate strategy is

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.220
formalized, how familiar it is

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.760
with the staff.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.140
Until, say, a company that evaluates

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.500
a company for its value

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.660
will necessarily go through the

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.740
middle-low executives

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.720
and ask about what is your

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.520
company's strategy in the

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.420
market, if you know it, where

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.260
it is located, if you can

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.640
get acquainted with

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.100
it, and so on.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.420
Second, trust in key executives

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.680
is tested on two main

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.180
parameters.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.240
First, the powers of key executives.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.280
If you have a commercial director

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.020
can sign payments for a amount

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.040
of no more than 20 thousand rubles,

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.940
this indicates that there is no trust

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.620
in him, larger payments are all

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.820
in the competence of the

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.260
general director.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.680
In addition, trust in key executives

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.860
is checked by contracts

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.020
with top managers.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.280
That is, it looks how key

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.340
managers, at the level of

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.500
Deputy CEOs, are tied

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.140
by their motivation system

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.460
to the performance of the

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.000
company as a whole.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.280
Are they only on salaries or

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.800
they participate, tied to their

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.280
pocket, in the financial

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.880
results of the company as a

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.560
whole.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.380
The next opportunity for

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.180
professional growth and training.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.000
It looks at whether there is a training

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.440
program in the company, how much it is

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.760
performed, what dynamics on the

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.400
learning processes in the company

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.280
is observed in recent times.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.040
For the last three to four years, sometimes

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.960
asking for learning data for the last

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.840
five years and looking at whether there

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.100
is a dynamic in the number of

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.160
students, whether there is a dynamic

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.520
in the number of hours of general study,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.220
whether there is a dynamic in the

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.040
budgets for training, checked how

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.880
much the company provides opportunities

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.980
for its employees for

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.020
professional growth.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.880
The fourth point is innovation and

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.540
the sixth point is not directly

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.220
within our fellow competence,

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.780
but the fifth point is the

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.720
ability to attract and retain

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.120
talent is entirely our task

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.020
with you.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.860
What is the indicator that we have

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.440
attracted and retained talent?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.040
Again two factors.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.140
The first factor.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.620
To this point, the appendices are

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.700
summary of senior and middle-level

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.080
managers.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.720
Those who rate us look at

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.560
how much those we attracted

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.880
to the company are really stars.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.400
They look at education, look at

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.880
previous level of work and level

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.500
of responsibility.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.740
The second point, which is addressed

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.040
here by the MZ, is the

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.760
information requested.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.040
Have you been fired from the company

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.000
in the last four years?

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.380
If so, there is complete statistics.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.780
If the dismissals occurred,

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.300
unfortunately, it will

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.040
be concluded that we

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.840
attract stars, but we can'

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.180
t hold them.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.180
The competence of managers

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.500
is also assessed by the level of delegation.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.520
What questions can we delegate to the

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.440
manager and what questions the

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.840
company delegated to the manager.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.420
The next.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.540
Adjustment of corporate payment system

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.500
with the interests of shareholders.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.280
This is a very important point for

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.100
those who intend to be allowed to buy

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.740
a company or take it to an IPO.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.420
Shareholders want to be sure that with

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.880
the change of owner the top manager

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.520
and middle management will not leave the company.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.020
Therefore, they would like to know

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.360
that the motivation system, first

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.000
of all, is long-term, tied to

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.680
long-term indicators.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.820
Secondly, the system that we have

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.260
is motivation and incentives

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.340
of staff, it provides for

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.500
the interest of all people

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.260
in the company in making the

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.920
company's value grow.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.980
A separate point is the development

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.740
of leadership.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.040
As far as training is only about

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.980
professional skills or the company

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.300
also invests in the development

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.080
of personal qualities of its

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.940
employees, this is where

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.520
this attention is paid.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.040
The quality of the main business

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.100
processes is often beyond

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.820
the framework of the management

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.200
system of the company

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.840
as a whole.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.960
So this point is brief.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.500
Business processes should be

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.880
clear, understandable and, again,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.340
accessible to all levels of

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.520
staff in the company.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.880
In addition, the signs of the low

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.380
cost of the company's human

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.120
resources, according to the study

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.480
conducted by the reputable company

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.460
Profi, are as follows.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.400
The flow of personnel, the instability

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.500
of the company, the inability to retain

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.520
it, to attract staff, is an indicator

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.580
of the very low cost of the company's

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.760
staff.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.100
The dismissal of the company's top

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.640
managers for the last year, which we have already

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.540
talked about earlier.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.700
The constant resolution of conflicts

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.620
among staff at various levels by

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.300
senior management, the fact that the

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.420
system is not well-established, the

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.880
fact that the company's manager is

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.520
forced to spend his resources on drying

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.780
and crushing conflicts between people,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.100
is a very bright indicator that the

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.600
system of human resources management,

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.180
first, is not de-built,

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.640
and secondly, that this staff

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.260
is quite cheap.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.340
In addition, I draw your attention,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.600
if there were any conflicts between

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.800
the administration and the personnel,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.040
if theft, theft and

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.560
other forms of personnel violations

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.340
were recorded and documented,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.280
this will also indicate that

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.220
the cost of the personnel

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.720
in the company is

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.120
quite low.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.960
To move to the next slide, we need

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.540
to distribute how the development

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.640
of the personnel management service

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.440
in the company is built.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.300
What we have already united depending

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.820
on the stage of the company's development

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.900
in the market, we would like

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.920
to consider now in more detail and

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.480
more in detail with the

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.240
link to the number of staff in

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.200
our company.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.560
So, if the number of staff is in the area

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.840
of ten people or several dozen,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.920
then, as a rule, the function

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.620
of personnel management is peacefully

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.860
performed by the head of the

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.400
organization itself.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.020
That is, the main function that goes

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.840
at this time is only the selection

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.920
of hiring and sometimes the personnel

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.620
business of production.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.660
At the next stage, once we have a

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.320
population of more than a hundred

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.780
people, there is a selection of hiring,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.800
production business, sometimes

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.980
training begins, and in those

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.420
companies that are focused on long-

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.200
term cooperation with the market,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.240
there is a team of education

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.820
and more developed management

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.480
functions.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.600
After six hundred people, we are already

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.880
talking about the staff department or

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.440
the HR department, as you can see, with

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.300
the following functions.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.260
The selection of rent, social package

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.220
we have appears here, and more developed

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.880
production business.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.180
We are already beginning to pay

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.800
attention to the administrative and

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.860
state services that are responsible

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.520
for controlling the workforce of production.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.880
And we have to build

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.900
a system of work with

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.620
personnel.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.000
Nearly 1,000 people have a wider function.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.340
We are developing staff training.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.980
That is, we can already develop our

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.000
staff, train, build a system of

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.460
work with the personnel

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.440
reserve, both with internal and

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.100
external.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.620
Well, more than two thousand people

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.280
have a full block, the entire line

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.960
of our personnel management functions.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.340
From hiring adaptation

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.260
to social programs,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.860
corporate events.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.300
And everything is built not on

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.220
an amateur level, but more than systematically.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.680
In the next slide we see the options

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.920
for implementing HR functions in the company.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.480
That is, the company with its growth,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.780
with the expansion

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.260
of its relations with the staff,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.480
can move in three main ways.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.120
And here they are depicted in sufficient detail.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.920
First, we can go the

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.080
standard way, complete,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.000
develop our own staff service.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.660
It has such a way separately and as

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.540
its pros, that is, we always have specialists

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.700
at hand, as well as its disadvantages.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.820


00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.700
This is usually a large

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.860
amount of funding.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.420
That, if we want to attract

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.120
professionals to our industries,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.980
then their cost is quite high.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.180
With the cost of the management system

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.320
we constantly decline the quality of

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.100
the management system.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.960
The second option, more

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.240
common in the market now, is the

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.360
use of internal services by personnel,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.480
freezing them on one level, and

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.120
with some extension of functions,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.800
adding tasks, if necessary,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.900
implementing this service

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.060
additional projects,

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.120
we actively engage

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.560
external providers.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.100
There are also certain difficulties.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.420
We, as we do not get rid of the disadvantages

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.100
of our own staff service, we are

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.820
supplemented by the huge disadvantages

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.780
of external providers, the

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.920
need to coordinate work

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.520
with them separately and increase

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.440
financial costs.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.880
The third way that is now

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.660
considered the most optimal

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.800
for today is outsourcing, where

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.220
we give all of the HR functions

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.360
to internal suppliers, leaving

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.720
within the company only those

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.840
functions that we need

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.340
to support, coordinate

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.080
and control our external

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.960
service providers.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.460
The disadvantages, of course,

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.840
are certain, especially if the

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.140
company is located in the region where

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.000
the external human resources management

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.240
market is not developed, where

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.020
there is insufficient number of recruitment

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.840
agencies, training centers,

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.660
consulting companies that can

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.560
lead high-level and high-quality

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.500
human resources management projects.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.360
In other words, the system

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.600
seems to be the most optimal

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.340
for companies that have started to

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.360
expand the system of human resources management.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.500
The most interesting thing is that we

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.100
are attracting professionals.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.600
A company, say, which is engaged

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.700
in recruiting staff, it is engaged in

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.580
this constantly and in the entire

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.300
market.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.500
It has more detailed information

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.840
about the labor market, it has

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.800
information from your competitors

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.880
about their salary level, their

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.160
level of managers, something

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.700
that will never be with an

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.060
internal staff specialist.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.240
No matter what option of development

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.360
of the staff you choose, which structure

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.940
is more convenient for you to manage,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.900
sooner or later the question arises,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.740
how to assess the effectiveness of

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.600
the staff management service,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.020
how to assess the efficiency or

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.440
inefficiency of your management

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.040
of the human resources.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.080
Recently, the topic has become very

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.600
relevant, because if we can assess

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.400
the activity of the sales department

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.560
by some economic factors,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.920
then, as regards the activity

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.620
of the personnel service,

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.000
such an assessment is very difficult.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.560
As a rule, the main factor

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.180
by which we assess the effectiveness

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.340
of human resources management

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.120
is, as you can see, in the

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.060
area of the company's staff satisfaction

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.640
with certain activities of

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.440
the staff service.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.220
How comfortable is the staff, what conditions

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.240
of work they have, how satisfied

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.080
the staff is with the motivation

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.920
system, the training system, the

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.140
promotion system within the company.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.220
It is by these indicators that the

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.060
activities of the staff service are assessed,

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.940
whether they are effective or ineffective.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.360
As a rule, a survey is conducted

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.240
among employees of the company with

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.180
a fairly typical set of questions

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.940
on each block of factors that

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.600
are important for employees

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.680
when they work in the company.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.080
With this survey, it is clear

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.400
how comfortable, comfortable,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.780
interesting people are to work,

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.400
how much they see prospects for

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.680
themselves within the company,

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.460
how much they understand and are

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.420
interested in the existing system

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.860
of pay and premium within the company.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.420
In addition, often the staff

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.500
services are linked to efficiency

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.400
to the company's savings.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.720
It is believed that the rating

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.840
is quite vicious, because

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.500
it forces the HR service to work

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.240
inefficiently, but economically,

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.480
in principle, if not badly,

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.540
but cheaply.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.120
If we move to the new, latest trends

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.420
in the labour markets for the evaluation

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.960
of personnel services, we see that

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.200
among the current trends there

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.780
is already an opinion that personnel

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.480
costs are not costs, it is

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.940
an investment in the future.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.800
However, the question of evaluating

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.900
these investments remains quite difficult

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.160
and there are many copies broken

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.340
about how we evaluate the effectiveness

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.900
of investment in personnel,

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.820
especially the effectiveness of

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.100
investment in staff training.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.240
It is very difficult to formalize

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.800
the effectiveness of education economically.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.400
However, recently we see that the attitude

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.900
to HR is changing, shareholders

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.920
are interested in them, HR performance

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.380
indicators are taken into

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.920
account when estimating the cost of

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.900
companies, the HR system is

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.460
already becoming not only a center

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.160
of costs, but also a center

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.240
of profit.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.720
It can be said that the trends of modern

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.280
HR practices are consistent with the

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.140
general trends in the market.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.100
Attention is not paid to costs, but

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.480
to investments, attention is paid to the

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.740
company's value and attention is paid

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.980
not only to economic factors, financial

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.520
factors of the company's value, but also

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.560
to the qualitative indicators of this value.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.860
The subject is complex, little formalized

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.020
and sufficiently, say, abstractly

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.620
understood to date.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.560
What is in this block of work?

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.380
It includes a large division of

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.060
the diagnosis of corporate culture,

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.540
the definition and development of basic

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.120
principles, values, norms and rules

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.800
of our company and the diagnosis

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.460
of the internal communication

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.840
system in the company.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.980
What do we have as a result?

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.640
In the following slide

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.340
we have listed that as a result

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.200
of all our actions, our entire

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.480
work block on corporate culture

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.660
we have formed and mainly divided

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.080
by personnel corporate

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.220
norms, rules and values.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.700
We see strengthening staff

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.700
loyalty through feedback

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.480
and we have an effective

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.280
toolkit to work with corporate

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.940
culture.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.580
What is the corporate culture

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.940
in the company and why should

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.140
it be done?

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.980
Recently, the corporate culture

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.020
has been paid attention

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.540
not only to personnel

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.280
management professionals,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.900
but also to the CEOs

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.220
and managers of

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.500
the company.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.920
Here I can refer to the study

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.900
of the Association of Managers of Russia,

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.800
which conducted a survey among the

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.220
first persons of the company on the topic

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.500
of what influences corporate culture.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.040
You see that from the point

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.560
of view of managers and owners,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.000
corporate culture is needed

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.880
precisely because, first, it

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.940
provides a positive image of the

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.440
company among the staff, and

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.680
the labour market, and among

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.100
shareholders, contributes

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.400
to higher performance, that is,

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.200
affects economic performance,

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.760
on the economic results

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.560
of the company.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.220
Corporate culture promotes

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.980
better motivation of staff

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.160
and generally has a huge

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.720
impact on intangible

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.500
motivation.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.560
It is one of the key factors of the

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.260
company's development strategy

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.420
and allows to improve the efficiency

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.540
of business processes.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.840
That is, as can be seen in this slide,

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.440
most of the respondents note that corporate

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.280
culture is needed, but it has not

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.840
gone without the backward, who believe

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.840
that the formation of corporate

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.120
culture is absolutely not necessary

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.500
and is absolutely luxurious.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.140
If we move further, we can look

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.000
more closely at how culture

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.560
affects the performance

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.560
of tasks.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.580
If people are intimidated,

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.200
they start thinking only

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.940
of today, and if they think of tomorrow,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.420
they start thinking only of

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.080
where to find a new job.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.660
If employees through a clever system

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.720
of fines, contracts, to take

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.740
out the earnings and try to catch

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.220
it at every corner, then, as a

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.320
rule, employees calmly start to

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.740
compensate for these problems

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.860
with theft.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.520
If we start paying the

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.780
prizes on some dates, not for

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.900
achievements, not for development,

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.140
not for professionalism, employees

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.660
have absolutely no motivation

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.120
to grow, develop

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.580
or any result.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.020
If our internal morality in the

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.640
team is absolutely absent, whether

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.500
we want it or not, it will be

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.020
transferred to interaction

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.840
with customers and partners,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.120
which we now see in

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.780
a number of retail companies.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.680
If we train employees, but the

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.240
direct managers of employees

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.760
demonstrate the exact

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.140
opposite behavior, then

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.020
there will be no results, neither

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.480
economic nor qualitative,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.820
from training.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.040
If we sent a sales employee to

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.880
a training in negotiation skills,

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.460
where for 2-3 days the coach tells

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.680
him that the customer is our

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.820
all, everything for the sake of

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.760
the customer, we love the customers,

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.520
and then, coming to the company,

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.800
the employee sees that his direct

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.080
manager, the head of the sales

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.980
department in close communication,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.320
the employee has no motivation

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.320
or internal interest in

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.920
demonstrating other behavior.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.700
Well, if we promote not for

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.280
training, not for advancement,

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.200
but for family ties, for some

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.860
political hiccups within

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.860
the company, employees

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.100
will have no motivation

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.340
to study.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.160
What measures can we apply and

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.300
use when we need to maintain

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.840
or change the corporate

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.340
culture in our company, which

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.680
is what we pay attention to in

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.860
the first place, which is the

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.420
key points of application

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.860
of our efforts if we want

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.280
to change the existing corporate

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.880
culture.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.040
The most important thing, number one, is

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.420
what the managers and managers of the

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.960
company pay attention to.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.460
If you have managers and executives

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.360
in your company who love

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.240
to play sports, then, of

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.900
course, most middle managers and

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.560
ordinary employees will be enthusiastic

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.740
about playing football on Wednesday,

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.900
because there they can see

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.160
the president, first,

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.520
second, the president encourages

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.040
it.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.120
The second is that it affects

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.300
the corporate culture, the response

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.320
of management to critical

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.800
situations, to any organizational

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.160
crises.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.080
It is known that in the

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.000
turbulent 90s, when the

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.280
tax services were checked, a

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.940
very sad sight or some conflict

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.980
with competitors came,

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.840
companies in which managers

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.580
did not escape, did not

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.000
hide, then showed, as a rule,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.420
higher results and survived

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.540
safely to our days.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.900
Another parameter that

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.980
helps us change a culture

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.580
or maintain one that interests

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.200
us is appropriate role

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.180
modeling training.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.800
If we want a corporate

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.380
culture, result-oriented, then

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.140
other ways than teaching people

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.460
to work for the result, to

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.340
teach teamwork for the result,

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.860
to teach a new system of motivation,

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.100
other ways that allow so fast

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.760
and qualitatively to introduce

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.800
people into a new situation,

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.000
they do not exist.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.180
The indicator, which I will mention here,

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.920
is the fourth in order, but I would

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.380
say that it is one of the first in

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.680
importance, the criterion for

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.420
determining remuneration and status.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.220
What we reward, what we

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.600
encourage, what our employees

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.240
will do.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.180
If we say that we encourage

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.020
and reward for the results,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.740
but in fact only encourage

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.940
and reward those who

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.040
are cousins of the

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.500
CEO, then it is unlikely

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.060
that we will be

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.080
doing good.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.000
The next point, quite important,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.240
which is an indicator of

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.860
what our corporate culture

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.260
is, are the criteria for hiring.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.540
Who do we take and how do we take?

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.520
We take by acquaintance or we

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.940
choose the most competitive employees

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.120
in the labour market so that

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.280
they give us the most

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.280
competitive results.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.260
This is an indicator of what

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.760
corporate culture we have.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.160
Well, a very important factor

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.520
are organizational symbols and rituals.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.680
What about organizational symbols

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.080
and rituals?

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.420
Types of rites that exist in a

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.220
company depending on what

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.180
we are encouraging.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.660
In general, the ceremony is designed to emphasize

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.240
the importance for the company of one

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.240
or another event in the life of the

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.820
company and the employee.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.680
There are promotional rites.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.140
The promotion rites include any

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:24.000
action by the company that

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.480
accompanies the promotion of an

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.020
employee within the company,

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.900
a change in his status, a change

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.720
in his position, a change in his

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.380
division, his place in the company.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.120
All of this is a promotion rite.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.540
Do we emphasize this fact?

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.200
In our environmental specialist became

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.540
the head of the department or

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.000
from the heads of the department

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.160
went to the deputy general director.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.900
Somehow besides the usual personnel

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.260
order and the designation

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.440
of the indications in it, whether we

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.120
accompany something, some actions,

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.260
some congratulations from the

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.340
head of the company or something else.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.900
These are the movements, these are the

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.840
changes in the fate of the employee and

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.900
our organization.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.600
Rites of care I would like to say

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.920
separately that the ritual of care is

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.820
different from the ritual of wires.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.100
The care ritual is how people leave the

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.140
company and how the company accompanies

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.040
them.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.640
And whether it accompanies at all or a person

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.580
for two days is chased only with a roundtable,

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.660
with the delivery of equipment

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.380
and so on and so on.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.060
The ritual of wires is how

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.940
a man leaves.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.000
Is it accepted in the company that

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.740
a person leaves their contacts when caring.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.160
Does the person leaving the company

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.420
know that in case of the

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.120
need for new projects in the company

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.180
with him will not be lost communication,

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.160
he will be informed of all

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.920
the news in the company and

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.100
in case he will always have

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.120
the opportunity to return.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.540
Ritual of conflict resolution.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.180
If there was a conflict between

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.080
the units or between the employees,

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.220
the resolution of this conflict

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.320
is somehow noted, whether it is

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.280
fixed somewhere, whether

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.640
attention is given to such an

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.000
important event as the conclusion

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.600
of some important, significant,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.620
long-playing conflict.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.300
Historical rites are rites that are

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.240
linked to the history of the company.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.860
Whether you mark some holiday,

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.000
or even not a holiday, any

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.560
reminder to employees, any

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.340
fact, any exclamatory

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.460
sign that the company has

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.840
a new anniversary, that

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.900
the company has a birthday.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.080
It must be paid tribute, in most companies

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.060
today, however, the historical

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.780
rites are observed quite

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.500
clearly.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.760
To the rites of unity we usually

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.880
refer to team building, that is,

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.740
team-building activities and everything

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.800
related to this sphere.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.440
Image rituals are rituals that are

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.660
more targeted not on our internal

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.880
consumer, on our employees,

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.900
but on the external of our partners,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.140
customers, suppliers, and

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:18.720
so on.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.980
In general, types of activities

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.700
that can fix our rituals.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.700
Timebilding, that is, the team

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.180
of education, the toolkit is interesting,

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.100
and you need to give it a

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.480
honourable result.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.680
General meetings and general meetings.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.400
And I understand that other times,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.300
when the number of companies has exceeded

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.100
several thousand, to arrange

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.960
conferences and general fees

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.880
becomes physically impossible.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.580
But at least general, unified

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.380
conferences for professionals in one

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.620
field, for example, the collection of

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.520
those who work in sales services,

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.220
some common clubs of managers.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.800
Companies are trying to pick.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.040
The corporate holidays.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.520
You should ask yourself a question.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.580
Is corporate holiday a unifying

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.440
action or a dissociating one?

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.960
That is, do you organize separate holidays

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.820
only for the management, only for

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.760
your own, and employees quietly

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.340
celebrate on business,

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.800
dropping down who can?

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.160
Or are you really trying to

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.420
organize a cheaper but unified

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.460
holiday for the whole company?

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.080
And when spending the holidays, it is

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.440
still worth keeping in mind the ultimate goal.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.560
Why do we do it and what do

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.720
we want to as a result?

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.740
The main activity is the

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.780
development and maintenance of

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.060
various sources of information.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.360
Someone has newspapers, someone has

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.140
magazines for managers on Finnish

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.000
paper, for the ordinary staff

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.760
on the ordinary newspaper.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.260
Someone has this in the electronic

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.600
form of the site, someone has the

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.940
opportunity to arrange a round

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.060
table and feedback with the CEO

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.260
or the first person of the company.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.860
For the staff, it is very important to

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.240
have the opportunity to ask the first person

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.460
a question and hear the answer from him.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.720
There are 20 levels of control.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.440
Conference calls, especially

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.840
common, have recently been

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.880
actively used in companies

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.300
of holding type or with a large

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.980
regional network.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.460
It is true, the technology

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.060
is not in place.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.560
And conferences organized through

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.520
the Internet are very actively

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.000
supplanting Internet calls.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.080
An important event that we have

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.500
affects corporate culture, change

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.820
of compensation elements.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:57.340
For what we encourage, behavior is given.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.480
If you want to get loyal

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.280
employees, reward for loyalty,

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.020
for loyalty.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.100
Enter the compensation system remuneration

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.880
for the duration of work in

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.680
the company, for a long

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.560
period, for mentoring.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.560
If you want to be more

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.260
efficient, encourage

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.000
for economic results.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.680
But be honest with yourself,

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.580
then don't encourage loyalty.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.920
Because, as a rule, shifting several

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.600
values within one company instead

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.960
of setting clear guidelines,

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.000
doing this for employees, will

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.200
bring confusion and

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.680
misunderstanding.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.380
So what are we valued?

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.700
Do we value professionalism

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:42.080
first, or do we value loyalty first?

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.700
Or do we still value performance,

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.540
despite anything?

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.840
An important, personal indicator

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.480
for employees that their company

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.540
values is congratulations

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.820
on individual occasions.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.460
I would also like to pay tribute

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.140
to the fact that the tool, despite

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.120
its great efficiency,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.000
is not applicable in large large

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.980
corporations, where it is quite difficult

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.720
to track the congratulations

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.340
of employees, to track

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:18.580
updates in personal state,

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.140
in the family situation

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.280
of employees.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.940
It is more applicable in small

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.860
teams where every employee is in

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.780
sight and everyone knows what

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.020
changes have occurred in each.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.880
Congratulations on personal

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.460
and national holidays.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.640
The toolkit is also effective,

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.520
but the more company, the less

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.440
this toolkit is applicable.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.540
Competitions and awards.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.140
It works well in companies of different

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.240
levels and different numbers.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.060
If in larger companies and competitions

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.860
we have more formal, more formalized,

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.840
prescribed with ten provisions, in a

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.980
more strict official style, then

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.120
in smaller companies competitions,

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.000
as a rule, take place with a deviation

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.140
to the KVN, with a deviation to humor

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:18.620
and with a deviation to the

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.860
team of education.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.440
In large companies, competitions,

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.860
as a rule, are either children's or

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:29.380
sports, or competitions for the company's

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.160
anthem, the company's motto, some

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.560
more official, tied to the work.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.460
As we move to the next slide,

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.680
we would like to look at

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.460
the obstacles that are preventing

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.360
us from changing our

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.240
corporate culture.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.260
Not always the corporate culture

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.620
is the first person of the company.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.720
Often with the growth of the company,

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.760
when the company has already declared

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.260
on the market, when the management

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.880
of the company has already decided

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.280
that the main guidelines

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.600
of the company, say, performance,

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.140
the main employees often inertia

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.420
adhere to an absolutely different

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.140
corporate culture, say,

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.780
focused on loyalty.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.380
And they believe that the fact

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.380
that they come to work on time, leave

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.340
on time and have worked in the company

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.400
for 10 years gives them a reason

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.700
to raise a higher premium.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.900
Therefore, here we are facing the

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.120
task not to maintain the

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.640
corporate culture, but to change it.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.420
And here is very important

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.240
becomes the listed 5 factors

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.040
that prevent us from influencing

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.280
corporate culture, just

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.800
stand a wall.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.940
First, it is a lack of organizational

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.360
development strategy, a lack

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.840
of understanding of how

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.860
we want to change ourselves

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.660
and where the company wants

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:50.820
to grow.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.200
A very painful process that effectively

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.940
neutralizes all our attempts

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.380
to influence culture is

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.820
to replace the process of changing

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.620
corporate culture with only

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.720
slogans or new jargon.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.020
Hello, we are all working

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.080
on the result, let's work on

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.400
the company now.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.680
Unfortunately, such procedures

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.220
are not enough to results.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.400
The change in corporate culture

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.480
is not initiated from the upper,

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.560
but from the middle level.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.720
Until changes in corporate culture

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.440
become interesting to the management

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.480
of the company, the first persons of

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.500
the company, changes can not even start.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.620
This will be wasted time and resources.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.180


00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.180
The dominance of short-term goals

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.480
is related to our first point.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.700
If there is no long-term strategy,

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.560
but only short-term, we can win

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.600
all in the market, then changes

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.880
in corporate culture do not pass.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.580
As a result of all of

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.920
the above, we have cynicism

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.580
among employees, as a result

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.280
of the lack of realization

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.940
of values.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.460
Values have stated, let's say, we all

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.800
work for the result, but left the previous

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.500
system of motivation.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.300
That is, as we rewarded employees

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.240
for loyalty, for the long period

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.780
of work in the company, so we

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.840
continue to premium for the

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.500
new year.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.420
It is clear that people

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.520
are skeptical of all our

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.180
slogans and all our loud

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.500
statements.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.000
What methods, on the contrary,

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.920
are effective for changing

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.100
the organizational structure?

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.300
The main, most effective methods

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.380
of changing corporate culture

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.960
are by degree of suffocation.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.740
As you can see, in the first place,

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.360
the support of the senior management

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.380
without interest, without the

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.400
attention of senior managers to the

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.840
project of changing corporate culture,

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.100
results will not be special.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.560
The second place is training employees

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.940
to new methods and technologies

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.320
in the new environment, in the

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.180
new corporate culture.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.800
And in the third place, note,

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.600
with a sufficiently large weight,

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.720
with high efficiency is the

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.980
formulation, the formalization

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.520
of our values, our norms

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.060
and our rules.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.560
As a rule, the project of corporate

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.800
culture begins absolutely autonomously,

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.660
parallel to the main tasks

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.200
and functions of the

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.920
HR service.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.020
Then, after the end of this

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:43.440
project, it goes to function, not

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.180
to task with specific

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.820
indicators in time, with

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.980
specific indicators on results.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.660
An example of such a project

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.320
on corporate culture we can

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.500
see in this slide.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.840
How does a corporate culture

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.460
project begin?

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.200
By formulating the values

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.620
and visions we want to.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.500
Until values are stated, employees

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.020
cannot not understand them,

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.340
not share them.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.800
Here a specific project was taken,

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.360
which was carried out

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.580
on the corporate culture

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.240
in a fairly large company.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.360
The most difficult case, the most

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.320
extreme option, when to

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.060
form a corporate culture and

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.020
communicate it was necessary to

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.300
1000 employees.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.120
The work was constructed as follows.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.840
Working groups were held on the

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.440
task of forming vision and forming

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.120
values, on the task of decoding

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.220
values, on their formalization.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.780
After that, seminars were

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.180
held with company managers

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.460
at all levels on decoding values.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.940
The conference was called

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.260
“From a unified vision

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.900
to unified action”.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.360
The main task of this conference

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.960
was to formalize and find common

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.080
features in the corporate culture,

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.200
which was unified for all

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.560
employees.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.020
There were also seminars not

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.500
only with managers, but with

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.040
all employees.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.680
We have developed relevant

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.940
personnel and management

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.800
documents, which described our requirements,

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.480
our norms, our rules, which employee

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.500
is good for us, what is bad,

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.980
who we encourage, who we

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.120
welcome, what actions in our

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.180
company are unacceptable.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.580
The next step was the diagnosis of

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.640
the state in order to find common,

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.840
unified values.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.420
Interviews were conducted

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.500
with the managers, analysis of

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.380
corporate documents was conducted on

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.080
all enterprises that were part of

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.300
this holding.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.100
Employees were surveyed,

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.260
the results were processed

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.620
accordingly and reports

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.320
were prepared to make

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.840
it clear where we

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.680
are moving with our

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.240
corporate culture.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.600
There were also general requirements

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.360
for corporate culture.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.720
That is, first we made a measure of

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.960
how we have it, how everyone understands

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.800
corporate culture today, who and

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.860
how sees it for themselves, who

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.540
sees the company, who sees the

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.360
values, who sees the norms.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.180
After that, a huge stage began

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.860
in formulating and forming those

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.920
values that are desired and

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.140
that should be.

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.440
Here, through conferences

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.780
with management, with employees,

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.500
the basic documents were formalized

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.720
in which we formalize

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.060
our corporate culture.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.640
This is the corporate code, it is

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.920
the employee guide and it is the “Our

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.780
Corporate Traditions” block.

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.060
The next step, after we have formed,

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.460
agreed and approved our necessary

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.260
package of documents to consolidate

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.940
our corporate culture,

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.400
is to begin broadcasting

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.040
our corporate culture to

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.740
all levels of our employees.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.400
It started again.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.280
We have seminars.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.320
We have sent our developed

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.000
documents to all companies that

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.940
are part of the holding,

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.940
at all levels of the holding.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.860
We conduct seminars and tell

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.560
us what we will have corporate

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.320
culture, what we are aiming

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.900
for, who we consider

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.160
a good employee, who is bad,

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.180
how to do to advance

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.140
within our company.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.600
We also develop a corporate

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.220
communication system within

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.500
this same block.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.200
How will we continue to uphold all

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.780
our values, norms and rules?

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.020
Here we have the mail, here we have

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:56.020
the newspaper, here we have feedback

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.020
from employees.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.980
An active block in the broadcast

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.120
is the work of a training center

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.740
or training manager or training

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.620
department within the company.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.900
In how they will build a system of training

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.060
staff to new knowledge and requirements,

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.100
depends in a great deal on the

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.680
effectiveness of our project as a whole.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.460
Well, and organizing meetings

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.780
of managers with staff in

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.360
order to make it from

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.200
managers staff to learn

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.440
what new values in the company

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.540
are welcomed.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.140
Then our project goes into current

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.020
activity and function.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.660
We regularly conduct surveys, we regularly

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.880
organize staff consultations with managers,

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.800
and we, the staff service, regularly

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.340
conduct conversations with

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:45.540
the staff themselves,

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.640
and how they understand what

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.100
they have suggestions, wishes,

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.260
requests on the corporate

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.740
culture.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.740
The Corporate Code is one

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.280
of the basic documents that

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.140
defines our norms, values

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.460
and rules.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.040
The structure of

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.640
the corporate code is

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.040
as follows.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.640
First, we speak and declare the

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.040
basic corporate basic principles

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:16.100
of the company as a whole.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.940
As a rule, here sound

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.700
honesty, decency, customer

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.080
orientation and so on.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.060
What the company values in itself

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.200
and its employees.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.280
The next block is the values that are

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.560
at the basis of the company's activities.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.120
What the company is focused on,

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.640
what is value in it, what is value

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.640
for employees and what the

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.900
company values its employees.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.400
And then we talk about how

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.640
these values, stated by us earlier,

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.480
are transmitted into the daily

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.840
behavior of managers,

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.620
employees, staff in the interaction

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.840
within the company with

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.460
customers, suppliers,

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.760
and so on.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.600
In other words, inside and outside.

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.550
Thus, the corporate code unites

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:10.110
three main blocks – principles,

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.910
values and standards of behavior

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:15.350
within itself, becoming an

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:17.010
internal set of laws,

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:18.630
an internal Bible for all

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.090
the company staff.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:22.390
At the end of our seminar, we

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:24.410
would like to wish you that your

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:26.970
internal code of laws is effective,

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:29.970
effective, that your human resources

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:32.370
management system is shared by

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.550
all the staff of your company.
