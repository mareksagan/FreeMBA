00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
Good day!

00:06.160 --> 00:08.220
My name is Andrey Kulinich and I present the topic

00:08.220 --> 00:11.680
The main concepts of marketing, marketing concept of management.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.680
The concept of marketing was created in 1910.

00:15.680 --> 00:22.440
It is a conglomerate of two words mark-getting, that is, to take the market, to get the market.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.840
It is believed that the first marketing study was officially published

00:25.840 --> 00:33.640
in 1901, and it was a report of the Industrial Commission on Sales of Agricultural Products in the United States.

00:33.640 --> 00:39.080
In 1926, the American Association of Marketing and Advertising was created.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.960
On its basis, the American Society of Marketing was formed in the future.

00:43.960 --> 00:51.840
In the 1940s, the first systematization of marketing, marketing approach to enterprises appeared.

00:51.840 --> 00:57.760
In the 1950s, a term that has survived almost unchanged to this day,

00:57.760 --> 00:59.400
that is, marketing mix, appeared.

00:59.400 --> 01:06.040
In 1968, the first books on consumer behavior were published.

01:06.040 --> 01:11.480
If you look at the history of marketing in the Soviet Union and Russia,

01:11.480 --> 01:16.320
then for the first time it was officially discussed in the 1980s,

01:16.320 --> 01:22.840
when a course of marketing was conducted in the program of some universities.

01:22.840 --> 01:29.120
In 1995, the first standard of teaching marketing appeared in universities.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.720
Since then, it has undergone certain changes,

01:31.720 --> 01:38.720
but this profession still exists, and our universities train specialists in this field.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.920
There are a huge number of marketing departments.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.480
According to various estimates, there are from 1,500 to 2,500 of them.

01:46.480 --> 01:50.080
In fact, there are much more, but we just could not count them.

01:50.080 --> 01:58.960
Marketing is a science of the formation of differences that customers perceive and are ready to pay for them.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.400
This is one of the definitions.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.880
Marketing is a social management process,

02:02.880 --> 02:07.760
with the help of which individual persons and groups satisfy their needs

02:07.760 --> 02:12.200
and needs through the creation of goods and consumer values,

02:12.200 --> 02:14.680
and the exchange of them.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.680
This definition belongs to Philip Kotler.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.200
If we look at the official definition of marketing,

02:20.200 --> 02:26.800
then it is a process of planning and implementation of the concept of price formation,

02:26.800 --> 02:30.120
promotion and distribution of ideas, goods and services,

02:30.120 --> 02:36.000
for the exchange of goods and services, which satisfies the goals of individual people and enterprises.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.600
This definition belongs to the American Association of Marketing,

02:40.600 --> 02:44.520
which is considered the legislator of fashion in this industry.

02:44.520 --> 02:49.520
Marketing has changed, its definitions have changed.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.320
Initially, there was no need to promote goods,

02:54.320 --> 02:57.840
because demand on the market exceeded the offer.

02:58.160 --> 03:07.280
Remember the early 90s, when there were tickets for food, clothes, and other consumer goods.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.280
Why was there a need to promote products?

03:09.280 --> 03:14.160
All that our enterprises produced was actually available to its consumer.

03:14.160 --> 03:20.280
Nevertheless, at some point demand was equal to the offer,

03:20.600 --> 03:25.560
and the winners were those manufacturers and shops

03:25.560 --> 03:31.560
that were primarily focused on the quality of sales and intensification of sales.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.560
The situation is changing.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.040
At present, demand is less than the offer.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.760
Accordingly, there is some overproduction and competition for us, consumers.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.240
The market is changing.

03:44.240 --> 03:48.760
The market is changing, it is more and more focused on the consumer,

03:49.240 --> 03:52.240
and this is reflected in the increase of the service,

03:52.240 --> 03:57.240
in the creation of new goods that are more convenient for us and meet our needs.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.240
What's next?

03:58.240 --> 04:00.240
Next is social orientation.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.240
We'll talk about it in the next moment.

04:02.240 --> 04:09.240
Let's talk again about the key stages in which marketing has developed.

04:09.240 --> 04:15.240
First of all, the enterprises that were focused on the improvement of production have won.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.720
Namely, the reduction of the cost of production and quality management.

04:19.720 --> 04:25.720
Some enterprises are still at this stage and are not developing further.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.720
Why? Because there is no need for this.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.720
For example, if you are a supplier of oil and gas,

04:31.720 --> 04:34.720
where the consumer does not perceive the difference,

04:34.720 --> 04:39.720
where it is difficult to improve, and there is no need to improve the quality of these products,

04:39.720 --> 04:41.720
they meet the standards,

04:41.720 --> 04:47.720
but the one who has more production sites and saves on a large scale wins.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.720
And those who can do it cheaper.

04:50.720 --> 04:59.720
Nevertheless, after in other industries, such as food, clothes, cars, industrial equipment,

04:59.720 --> 05:05.720
enterprises learned to produce equally well and equally cheaply,

05:05.720 --> 05:09.720
new approaches and new concepts were necessary.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.720
The concept of marketing oriented to the improvement of goods has appeared.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.720
Good goods are not needed in advertising.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.720
This phrase refers to this stage.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.720
Why? Because if you release a good and high-quality product,

05:22.720 --> 05:27.720
which is in demand by your clients, which has no analogues,

05:27.720 --> 05:31.720
we pass the information about it from word of mouth.

05:31.720 --> 05:35.720
And it means that the product will promote itself on the market

05:35.720 --> 05:38.720
solely due to its consumer characteristics.

05:38.720 --> 05:45.720
But the characteristics that we, as consumers, need are limited.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.720
Their quantity is limited.

05:47.720 --> 05:53.720
And after some time, many goods begin to be absolutely similar to each other.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.720
We do not see an advantage in them.

05:55.720 --> 06:02.720
They have the same technical characteristics, other consumer qualities.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.720
Where to go next?

06:04.720 --> 06:08.720
Those who were oriented to intensify sales.

06:08.720 --> 06:15.720
At this stage, such a marketing tool as advertising was needed.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.720
The one who advertises more, sells more.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.720
We faced this in the late 90s and early 2000s.

06:22.720 --> 06:28.720
We were fed with advertising, but it was the main tool for promoting goods.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.720
We bought, among other things, goods that were known,

06:31.720 --> 06:34.720
which were actually imposed on us.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.720
Here we did not ask the opinion of the consumer,

06:36.720 --> 06:38.720
whether he liked the product, whether he liked the advertising.

06:38.720 --> 06:43.720
We were pushing the opinion of the product in the head,

06:43.720 --> 06:46.720
if I may say so, of the consumer,

06:46.720 --> 06:51.720
and educated cohorts of active aggressive sellers.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.720
The one who will run more, will sell more.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.720
It worked.

06:55.720 --> 07:00.720
But now, when we have something to choose from,

07:00.720 --> 07:07.720
when many manufacturers and suppliers have reached perfection in the field of advertising,

07:07.720 --> 07:09.720
when there is no way to increase advertising budgets,

07:09.720 --> 07:14.720
and their efficiency is decreasing every day,

07:14.720 --> 07:18.720
new ideas and approaches are needed.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.720
We avoid pressure and choose those goods,

07:22.720 --> 07:25.720
which are more in line with our needs.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.720
It means that manufacturers, suppliers and sellers

07:28.720 --> 07:32.720
should take into account the interests of our consumers,

07:32.720 --> 07:38.720
and make goods and services that are in line with our needs.

07:38.720 --> 07:44.720
It is impossible to create goods and services that are good for everyone at the same time.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.720
This is marketing of the marketing niche segments.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.720
This is targeted marketing.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.720
It is the orientation of the consumer.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.720
It is important to understand what the consumer wants,

07:55.720 --> 07:58.720
what he wants, what he is ready to pay for,

07:58.720 --> 08:00.720
and offer him this.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.720
High service, orientation of the consumer,

08:03.720 --> 08:04.720
things are not cheap.

08:04.720 --> 08:10.720
The concept of raising prices or making a profit is related to this.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.720
But our prosperity is growing.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.720
We are ready to pay for the goods and products that are convenient for us.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.720
What is next? The world does not stop.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.720
Some Western countries and developed countries

08:21.720 --> 08:24.720
are already living on the social and ethical concept of marketing.

08:24.720 --> 08:32.720
When we choose goods that are more in line with our social status,

08:32.720 --> 08:42.720
we wear suits, we buy cars that are in line with our position in society.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.720
Ethical marketing is another side of the same coin.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.720
When there are goods that are of the same quality,

08:50.720 --> 08:55.720
not expensive, with the same characteristics,

08:55.720 --> 09:00.720
known and convenient for us as consumers,

09:00.720 --> 09:04.720
we look for additional reasons to choose one or another product.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.720
Accordingly, at a high level of prosperity,

09:08.720 --> 09:15.720
we choose goods that are more environmentally friendly.

09:15.720 --> 09:20.720
That is, when they are made, the least environmental damage was done.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.720
We choose goods of those manufacturers

09:24.720 --> 09:29.720
that comply with social and ethical norms in relation to their employees.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.720
We do not use, for example, child labor,

09:32.720 --> 09:37.720
or the proportion of women and men in the management staff.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.720
The proportion is approximately equal.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.720
It is important to understand that the type of competition

09:43.720 --> 09:46.720
in which you live changes according to the definition of marketing.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.720
Pure competition is quite rare.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.720
Pure competition is associated with stock markets,

09:52.720 --> 09:56.720
when there are many buyers and sellers,

09:56.720 --> 09:59.720
and buyers do not see significant differences

09:59.720 --> 10:01.720
except for the price in these goods.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.720
We have already talked about such goods.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.720
Oil, gas, sugar, flour in wholesale supplies

10:06.720 --> 10:09.720
must correspond to a certain cost.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.720
No more, no less.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.720
And why should I pay more for the same goods as a buyer?

10:14.720 --> 10:15.720
No, I will not.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.720
This is pure competition.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.720
That is, there is a struggle exclusively at the expense of the price.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.720
Monopolistic competition is not a monopoly.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.720
I ask you not to confuse.

10:26.720 --> 10:32.720
Monopolistic competition implies the presence of a large number of buyers

10:32.720 --> 10:34.720
and a large number of sellers.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.720
But buyers see significant differences in goods.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.720
They perceive them differently and evaluate them differently.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.720
For example, cars.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.720
There are quite a lot of manufacturers and quite a lot of buyers.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.720
But we understand or can explain to ourselves

10:54.720 --> 10:58.720
why BMW cars are more expensive than AvtoVAZ cars.

10:58.720 --> 11:02.720
We see these differences and are ready to pay various money.

11:02.720 --> 11:08.720
In this case, AvtoVAZ and Mercedes cars do not directly compete with each other.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.720
They have different consumers, both in terms of needs and in terms of profitability.

11:13.720 --> 11:19.720
If we talk about competition, then most likely BMW cars

11:19.720 --> 11:23.720
compete primarily with Mercedes, Audi, but not with a low price segment.

11:23.720 --> 11:29.720
That is, monopolistic competition implies a large number of buyers and sellers,

11:29.720 --> 11:34.720
but buyers see significant differences in goods.

11:34.720 --> 11:51.720
Oligopolistic competition implies the presence of 2-3 largest players in the market.

11:51.720 --> 11:57.720
For example, 3 large companies own 50-60% of the market.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.720
This means that there is no competition.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.720
They are about the same in strength and financial resources.

12:05.720 --> 12:13.720
And the main or smaller players are more likely to be guided by their behavior.

12:13.720 --> 12:19.720
It is these players who dictate the main conditions of competition,

12:19.720 --> 12:23.720
the main rules, the values, channels of promotion,

12:23.720 --> 12:29.720
and in fact have the opportunity to squeeze out small competitors.

12:29.720 --> 12:33.720
Oligopolistic competition implies that there is no competition.

12:33.720 --> 12:39.720
Moreover, sudden changes from the side of the largest players

12:39.720 --> 12:48.720
can lead to a price war and the winner will not be in equal conditions and resources.

12:48.720 --> 12:53.720
They understand this perfectly and try to coordinate their actions in one way or another,

12:53.720 --> 12:55.720
to develop as smoothly as possible.

12:55.720 --> 13:03.720
As a rule, the whole world comes to the mature stages of the market life cycle in the case of oligopolistic competition.

13:03.720 --> 13:09.720
That is, when the market is already stable or is declining.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.720
In Russia, unfortunately, the situation is a little different.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.720
This is due to non-standard development.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.720
When it was possible to acquire a whole industry,

13:17.720 --> 13:24.720
and they were concentrated in the hands of a small number of owners, a small number of enterprises.

13:24.720 --> 13:29.720
Therefore, the oligopolistic stage in the whole world, as a rule,

13:29.720 --> 13:34.720
corresponds to the orientation of the consumer or social and ethical marketing.

13:34.720 --> 13:42.720
In Russia, oligopolistic competition can exist in the situation of the orientation to production or to the improvement of the product.

13:42.720 --> 13:47.720
And you don't have to expect a significant change in the offer from their side.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.720
A pure monopoly.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.720
One seller.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.720
No one to choose from.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.720
You can give such examples yourself.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.720
Gazprom, Rao ES, and so on.

14:01.720 --> 14:09.720
It is important to understand that marketing changes the perception and the pursuit of the owner.

14:09.720 --> 14:14.720
Initially, the concept was oriented to the product out.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.720
That is, pushing the product to the market.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.720
We produce, we impose it.

14:19.720 --> 14:28.720
But at some point, there were a lot of products that we were trying to impose.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.720
The efficiency was not so high.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
And the market has changed.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.720
The concept of product in has appeared.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.720
We attract the market.

14:37.720 --> 14:47.720
We create goods that interest the customers, so that they come to us and leave their money.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.720
There was an exchange of goods, money, goods.

14:51.720 --> 14:56.720
But now we see vivid examples of invest-in.

14:56.720 --> 15:01.720
When companies earn not by selling goods or services,

15:01.720 --> 15:06.720
but they earn by placing their shares or bonds on the market.

15:06.720 --> 15:12.720
For example, the sale of a small package of shares to Wimbledon

15:12.720 --> 15:18.720
brought much more income to the owners than the company's profit over 10 years.

15:18.720 --> 15:27.720
That is, now you can create an attractive company for investors,

15:27.720 --> 15:32.720
but not earn on consumers,

15:32.720 --> 15:40.720
but earn by selling or trading shares on the market or selling to a strategic investor.

15:40.720 --> 15:47.720
Accordingly, the object of marketing is not a consumer, but a potential investor.

15:47.720 --> 15:55.720
It is important to understand that the development of marketing affects the development of marketing in the company of a large circle of interested parties.

15:56.720 --> 16:04.720
It is important to understand that the main marketers in the company are the owners and the CEO.

16:04.720 --> 16:12.720
They determine how the company perceives the client, what it is ready to do for him and for what money.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.720
Top managers can be considered as interested parties,

16:15.720 --> 16:23.720
who, through their vision, pass the orders of the managers and give them down.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.720
They manage the company's activities.

16:25.720 --> 16:33.720
Also, hired managers, hired employees, suppliers, buyers, partners, local authorities,

16:33.720 --> 16:39.720
which either limit or promote competition, also influence the marketing in the company.

16:39.720 --> 16:46.720
So, we have considered a number of conditions in which marketing exists.

16:47.720 --> 17:01.720
Please note that when competition, monopoly, oligopoly, pure monopoly, and the concept of marketing intersect,

17:01.720 --> 17:04.720
different conditions of its existence arise.

17:04.720 --> 17:13.720
And the definition of marketing for each cell, for each intersection will be different.

17:13.720 --> 17:21.720
And if we take into account that the group of interested parties, which we have listed above, also influences the definition of marketing,

17:21.720 --> 17:26.720
then in these conditions, the definition of marketing can be an infinite number.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.720
Here are some of them.

17:28.720 --> 17:33.720
Marketing is advertising, promoting sales and imposing goods on the buyer.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.720
A complex of aggressive sales tools.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.720
Isn't it true?

17:37.720 --> 17:42.720
It is clearly visible at what stage of development the company is in terms of marketing.

17:42.720 --> 17:47.720
Marketing is a complex of tools for market analysis, such as methods of forecasting sales volumes,

17:47.720 --> 17:55.720
imitation models, various market researches, which are used for a deeper scientific approach to analysis of demand and demand.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.720
An interesting definition.

17:57.720 --> 18:02.720
What stage of marketing does it correspond to in your opinion?

18:02.720 --> 18:07.720
There can be many definitions, some of them are funny.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.720
Marketing is all and all is marketing.

18:12.720 --> 18:19.720
Marketing is all that a consumer thinks about the company, said Peter Drucker.

18:19.720 --> 18:27.720
Marketing is all that managers do not want to do on sales, do not have time or cannot, as Igor Ryman said.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.720
Think about it.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.720
And what is the definition of marketing of your company?

18:31.720 --> 18:34.720
Give a short definition.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.720
Marketing is...

18:38.720 --> 18:42.720
Whatever you call a boat, it will swim.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.720
This is what marketing is.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.720
Let's get back to what influences the marketing of a company.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.720
Pay attention to the slide with the triad of Philip Kotler.

18:53.720 --> 18:59.720
Philip Kotler presented the marketing of a company as a triangle, at the top of which is the leader.

18:59.720 --> 19:06.720
I repeat once again that the main marketer in a company, the one who sets the tone, is the leader.

19:06.720 --> 19:13.720
Accordingly, in terms of angles, it is internal marketing, that is, the side between the leader and the staff.

19:13.720 --> 19:21.720
This is how the leader conveys his thoughts, the vision of the market, the understanding of the buyer, the understanding of the market strategy of the company.

19:21.720 --> 19:26.720
The second side is the connection between the leader and the client.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.720
This is the marketing that the company conducts on the market.

19:30.720 --> 19:39.720
If the leader does not understand who his clients are, what they want, then the marketing will be ineffective.

19:39.720 --> 19:49.720
It is important to understand that the staff that implements the strategy or vision of the leader is also an important component of the marketing.

19:49.720 --> 19:59.720
The way the staff understands the tasks and goals that are set by the leader, they implement through the relationship with the client.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.720
This is how they treat the client.

20:01.720 --> 20:07.720
In my opinion, the best representation of marketing in a company belongs to Jacques-Jean Lambin.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.720
Pay attention to the slide.

20:09.720 --> 20:14.720
Jacques-Jean Lambin says that marketing is three main aspects.

20:15.720 --> 20:23.720
First of all, it is the business philosophy, how you conduct it, what are the values of the company, what are the values for the market you create.

20:23.720 --> 20:29.720
This is exactly what the leader transmits inside the company.

20:29.720 --> 20:37.720
This is a set of marketing tools, methods, approaches, techniques, algorithms, tables.

20:37.720 --> 20:42.720
This is what is most understandable in marketing, but it does not work without philosophy.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.720
They are either a continuation or a tool.

20:46.720 --> 20:52.720
The third important thing for effective marketing is marketing as a function of management in the company.

20:52.720 --> 21:05.720
Marketing should have the power to plan, organize, motivate, execute and control the tasks set.

21:06.720 --> 21:11.720
Marketing should be a tool, it should be a force.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.720
Marketing is divided into two levels.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.720
There are two levels of marketing.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.720
Strategic marketing and tactical marketing.

21:21.720 --> 21:30.720
Strategic marketing is usually related to the analysis of the needs of the market, segmentation of the market,

21:30.720 --> 21:42.720
that is, dividing it into parts, how the company's proposals are perceived in relation to the company's competitiveness,

21:42.720 --> 21:47.720
highlighting the most promising segments in which the company will operate in the future.

21:47.720 --> 21:54.720
This is the analysis of competition and participation in the development of the company's strategy.

21:55.720 --> 22:05.720
Tactical marketing or operational marketing is a choice as a goal of the market segments determined at the stage of strategic marketing.

22:05.720 --> 22:19.720
The definition of a marketing mix is the definition of the marketing budget,

22:19.720 --> 22:28.720
the promotion of the product to the market and the execution and control of the goals set at the stage of strategic planning.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.720
So, marketing.

22:30.720 --> 22:38.720
If we talk about the functions of marketing, then the main functions are the formation of a production strategy,

22:38.720 --> 22:42.720
support of the sales department in promoting the product,

22:42.720 --> 22:52.720
supply of information about the situation in the market to the company's managers to make decisions about the company's actions,

22:52.720 --> 22:59.720
coordination of the actions of the company's main departments in order to meet the needs of the clients.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.720
Why has marketing become relevant now?

23:04.720 --> 23:06.720
First of all, it is about increasing the competition.

23:06.720 --> 23:15.720
We have already discussed that at some point the balance in the market was broken and the demand was lower than the supply.

23:15.720 --> 23:23.720
This means that it is necessary to better convey and better meet the needs of the client in what you do.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.720
The needs of the client are changing.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.720
Our welfare is growing.

23:29.720 --> 23:37.720
We have new desires, new consumer experience, and the company needs to follow its consumers.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.720
Our preferences are changing.

23:39.720 --> 23:44.720
We can afford to buy something better.

23:44.720 --> 23:49.720
It is important to understand that today we are competing with you on the global market.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.720
Already now, despite the fact that we are in Russia.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.720
Look around.

23:55.720 --> 23:58.720
There are products produced all over the world on the shelves of our stores.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.720
They are already available.

24:00.720 --> 24:07.720
This means that we are competing with the best companies that come to Russia from all over the world.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.720
The availability of information.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.720
The Internet has turned the world upside down.

24:13.720 --> 24:22.720
Each consumer can become an expert in a particular area, in a particular product that you offer.

24:22.720 --> 24:30.720
To do this, you just need to visit the Internet forums, read analytical notes, tests, and research reports.

24:30.720 --> 24:38.720
The reduction of the profitability of the product makes you think about how to survive the company.

24:38.720 --> 24:47.720
But the client's income is actually the only tool for making a profit for the company.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.720
So, marketing starts to play a role here.

24:52.720 --> 24:58.720
If we define the goal of marketing according to Peter Drucker, it is to make the efforts for the profit unnecessary.

24:58.720 --> 25:06.720
The goal of marketing is to make the client know so much that the product or service exactly meets his requirements or sells itself.

25:06.720 --> 25:13.720
Let's look at some of the main terms that marketing uses.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.720
First of all, it is a need.

25:16.720 --> 25:20.720
It is a feeling of a person's shortcoming in something.

25:20.720 --> 25:28.720
A need is a need that has taken a specific form in accordance with the cultural level and individuality of a person.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.720
Let me explain.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.720
For example, in the case of thirst.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.720
It is a need.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.720
A need is when we want to realize it.

25:40.720 --> 25:48.720
It is a need to satisfy a specific form of thirst.

25:48.720 --> 26:00.720
But depending on your cultural level, income level, location, nationality, you can satisfy it in different ways.

26:00.720 --> 26:07.720
You can drink water from under the tap, drink mineral water, tea, coffee, and so on.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.720
We can satisfy the same need in different ways.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.720
Requests.

26:12.720 --> 26:17.720
The needs of a person, which are supported by his purchasing ability.

26:17.720 --> 26:28.720
Our application to the store has a need, a need, and the necessary funds to satisfy this need.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
The product.

26:30.720 --> 26:36.720
Everything that can be offered on the market to satisfy the needs and requirements.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.720
Services.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.720
Products.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
The combination of products and services.

26:41.720 --> 26:46.720
Nowadays, people talk about impressions, like about a product.

26:46.720 --> 26:52.720
For example, imagine yourself with a cup of coffee near the Eiffel Tower.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.720
To see Paris and die.

26:54.720 --> 26:59.720
This is an impression that can be offered to you as a product.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.720
The market.

27:01.720 --> 27:06.720
The combination of potential buyers of a product or service.

27:06.720 --> 27:13.720
The market is defined by both manufacturers and buyers.

27:13.720 --> 27:22.720
The market is a division of something global, partly according to certain criteria.

27:22.720 --> 27:32.720
The markets can be local, the market of a product, the market of a certain circle of consumers, and so on.

27:32.720 --> 27:37.720
The market is a combination of potential customers.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.720
Demand.

27:40.720 --> 27:45.720
A specific need, supported by the purchasing ability.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.720
We have already talked about this.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.720
There are several types of demand.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.720
First of all, negative or non-existent.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.720
Zero.

27:56.720 --> 28:02.720
Hidden demand, which is not obvious, which is not shown by consumers.

28:02.720 --> 28:11.720
Falling demand, when the consumption of a particular product or service is reduced.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.720
Irregular demand or seasonal.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.720
A vivid example is a Christmas tree toy.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.720
Full-fledged demand.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.720
Stable demand for a particular product.

28:19.720 --> 28:24.720
Excessive demand, when demand exceeds the supply and leads to a shortage of a product.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.720
Irrational demand.

28:27.720 --> 28:35.720
When there are no rational motives explaining the consumption of a particular product.

28:35.720 --> 28:43.720
It is important to understand that the market is currently divided into industrial and consumer.

28:43.720 --> 28:50.720
Either B2B, business to business, or B2C, business to customer.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.720
Pay attention to the slide.

28:52.720 --> 29:01.720
Business to business market is usually associated with the manufacturers of goods, intermediaries, and stores.

29:01.720 --> 29:15.720
That is, when what is purchased is used either for the production of goods, services, or is later resold.

29:15.720 --> 29:23.720
B2C is a market where goods are supplied and sold for subsequent acquisition.

29:23.720 --> 29:32.720
Let's take a look at a minibus that can be found on two markets.

29:32.720 --> 29:38.720
If I buy a minibus for myself, for my family, to travel, to go fishing.

29:38.720 --> 29:44.720
I purchased it on the B2C market.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.720
That is, I am a consumer.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.720
I do not use it as a means of production.

29:49.720 --> 29:59.720
At the same time, if I am a private entrepreneur, I have a number of trading points and a minibus is necessary for me to transport goods.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.720
In this case, I purchased it on the B2B market.

30:03.720 --> 30:09.720
That is, for subsequent production of goods and services.

30:10.720 --> 30:19.720
The demand for goods of production consumption depends on a number of factors.

30:19.720 --> 30:24.720
But it is important for you to understand, and the microeconomists should have considered this,

30:24.720 --> 30:33.720
that the demand for any goods, including industrial consumption, is actually determined by the demand on the B2C market.

30:33.720 --> 30:42.720
That is, we, buying goods for our own consumption, stimulate the development of all other industries.

30:45.720 --> 30:49.720
It is important to understand what is the market capacity in marketing.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.720
That is, the market capacity on which we work.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.720
And here are two types of capacity.

30:56.720 --> 31:04.720
The real market capacity is the actual sales volume of the product or service.

31:04.720 --> 31:09.720
That is, the volume of the paymentable demand under certain conditions.

31:09.720 --> 31:21.720
That is, if we say that last year consumers purchased a couple of billion rubles of tourist services in the money equivalent,

31:21.720 --> 31:25.720
that is, this is the real market capacity.

31:25.720 --> 31:30.720
But at the same time, the second parameter is the potential market capacity.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.720
That is, the maximum sales volume in a market situation,

31:34.720 --> 31:41.720
when all potential consumers purchase goods based on the maximum possible level of consumption.

31:41.720 --> 31:52.720
That is, everyone has the opportunity and the need for these goods, and there is an opportunity to pay for the purchase of these services.

31:52.720 --> 31:58.720
The difference between the real market capacity and the potential market capacity is called the market potential.

31:58.720 --> 32:04.720
The market potential will be important for us, including for determining the life stage of the market,

32:04.720 --> 32:08.720
either goods or services, in subsequent analyzes.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.720
Several types of marketing are highlighted.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.720
First of all, this is mass marketing.

32:13.720 --> 32:21.720
When you offer the same type, the same characteristics for all consumers, for the same price, goods.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.720
That is, you do not select target groups.

32:24.720 --> 32:32.720
This type of marketing is possible under low competition,

32:32.720 --> 32:40.720
when you have no competitors and you can not think about the characteristics of the product for specific consumers,

32:40.720 --> 32:47.720
or in the case of exchange goods, where it is impossible to set distinctive characteristics of the product.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.720
Target marketing.

32:49.720 --> 32:55.720
In this case, we aim to influence a certain target group of consumers,

32:55.720 --> 33:01.720
offering them goods, focusing on certain of its characteristics.

33:01.720 --> 33:05.720
Marketing at the level of market niches.

33:05.720 --> 33:12.720
In this case, we are talking about small groups of consumers,

33:12.720 --> 33:18.720
for whom high loyalty and specific consumption are characteristic.

33:18.720 --> 33:26.720
For example, Harley Davidson motorcycles are nothing more than marketing at the level of market niches.

33:26.720 --> 33:31.720
That is, consumers of this product feel the need not only in the means of transportation,

33:31.720 --> 33:34.720
but also in the image of the purchased product.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.720
At the same time, the capacity of the segment or niche,

33:39.720 --> 33:47.720
on which Harley Davidson operates in relation to the entire motorcycle market is extremely small.

33:47.720 --> 33:51.720
Micromarketing, or marketing of one person.

33:51.720 --> 33:56.720
This is, as many experts say, the future of marketing.

33:56.720 --> 34:04.720
That is, in the near future, all goods and services will be produced for the needs of one individual.

34:04.720 --> 34:10.720
They will be customized, adapted, or generally produced for us.

34:10.720 --> 34:16.720
We are already working in this market, and we face similar offers.

34:16.720 --> 34:22.720
In particular, when you buy a car, you buy it for yourself.

34:22.720 --> 34:30.720
That is, you have the opportunity to build the configuration that is most convenient for you from individual offers.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.720
Marketing is extremely important.

34:32.720 --> 34:35.720
In highly competitive and developed markets,

34:35.720 --> 34:45.720
you can notice that the number of people in companies that are related to marketing often prevails over the rest of the staff.

34:45.720 --> 34:47.720
Pay attention to the slide.

34:47.720 --> 34:50.720
For example, Epsilon.

34:50.720 --> 34:53.720
The total number of employees in the company is 840.

34:53.720 --> 34:57.720
The company is engaged in data-based marketing,

34:57.720 --> 35:04.720
that is, it collects information about consumers, enterprises, and offers them to those who need it.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.720
The total number is 840 people.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.720
Of these, 230 people are related to marketing.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.720
Yes, the figure is slightly higher.

35:12.720 --> 35:23.720
Why? Because in the West, the number of sales representatives is often higher than the number of people in marketing.

35:23.720 --> 35:28.720
At the same time, it is important to understand that sales are nothing more than a tool for promotion.

35:28.720 --> 35:33.720
Sales are the most effective tool for delivering information to the consumer.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.720
However, there is one drawback.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.720
It is the most expensive.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.720
Look at the table.

35:40.720 --> 35:46.720
In almost all companies, the number of people involved in marketing is extremely large.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.720
It takes up a predominant share.

35:49.720 --> 36:00.720
Would Western companies pay for functions, for work that is not necessary?

36:00.720 --> 36:01.720
Of course not.

36:01.720 --> 36:08.720
This figure is due to the fact that marketing specialists will soon be scarce in our market,

36:08.720 --> 36:18.720
because competition is growing and there is a need for a number of new specific tasks that are solved by marketing.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.720
What tasks is marketing solving?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.720
Pay attention to the slide.

36:22.720 --> 36:23.720
Regular marketing.

36:23.720 --> 36:28.720
By and large, the functions of marketing, if you consider in a large scale,

36:28.720 --> 36:31.720
are, first of all, the analysis of competitors,

36:31.720 --> 36:33.720
the analysis of consumers,

36:33.720 --> 36:37.720
the assessment of the external environment and the dynamics of its changes,

36:37.720 --> 36:40.720
the forecasting of changes in the external environment,

36:40.720 --> 36:44.720
the analysis of the effectiveness of your own actions in the market,

36:44.720 --> 36:50.720
the decryption of sales results and the issuance of recommendations,

36:50.720 --> 36:57.720
the development of adequate solutions for changing the external environment and the internal environment based on the data of the analysis.

36:57.720 --> 37:02.720
It is important to understand that you can add functions related to promotion,

37:02.720 --> 37:04.720
the creation of new products.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.720
These are all the functions of marketing.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.720
I repeat, marketing is everything that the consumer sees.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.720
This is what he thinks about the company.

37:12.720 --> 37:17.720
But this suggests that marketing imposes a higher responsibility on itself.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.720
Modern marketing is changing.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.720
In particular, if we follow the thoughts of George Day,

37:24.720 --> 37:27.720
then it currently highlights a number of transitions.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.720
More offers and less differentiation.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.720
There are too many offers and it is extremely difficult to distinguish.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.720
We will talk about positioning a little later.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.720
We will say that there are certain limitations for positioning,

37:39.720 --> 37:42.720
which do not allow you to distinguish now.

37:43.720 --> 37:48.720
Accordingly, it is necessary to look for other ways to promote your products and services.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.720
More global and less local.

37:52.720 --> 37:56.720
We said that we are already competing with global brands.

37:56.720 --> 38:00.720
We are competing with transnational corporations due to the effect of scale,

38:00.720 --> 38:04.720
greater experience, and they are often more effective.

38:05.720 --> 38:09.720
This is one of the trends of our modern reality.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.720
More competition and more cooperation.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
Paradox.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.720
But it is really so.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.720
Western companies, for example, the most popular competitors, Sony and Philips,

38:20.720 --> 38:23.720
combine their efforts to develop standards.

38:23.720 --> 38:30.720
New digital standards, but at the same time they compete for consumers.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.720
We can come across interesting facts,

38:33.720 --> 38:39.720
when, for example, notebooks are produced by several manufacturers at the same production.

38:39.720 --> 38:45.720
But, cooperating at this stage, they aggressively compete for us.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.720
More relationships and less transactions.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.720
Simple human relations, constant contact,

38:52.720 --> 38:54.720
do not forget about this,

38:54.720 --> 38:55.720
become important.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.720
More thinking and reaction.

38:58.720 --> 39:01.720
And less options made and sold.

39:01.720 --> 39:02.720
Why?

39:02.720 --> 39:06.720
Because in connection with all the earlier-sounding transitions,

39:06.720 --> 39:09.720
there are fewer opportunities for manoeuvres.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.720
The market forgives your mistakes less,

39:13.720 --> 39:21.720
and you need to spend more time to reflect on your past mistakes

39:21.720 --> 39:24.720
and look for new guaranteed options,

39:24.720 --> 39:28.720
or the most guaranteed options for success.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.720
If we follow the ideas of Fred Versema,

39:31.720 --> 39:36.720
competition is spreading very actively.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.720
It is important to understand that with the development of the Internet,

39:39.720 --> 39:41.720
with the development of social networks and blockchains,

39:41.720 --> 39:43.720
all secrets become common.

39:43.720 --> 39:47.720
And that means that the one who implements faster is more protected,

39:47.720 --> 39:50.720
and not the one who hides his secrets better.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.720
It is almost impossible to hide them.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.720
Innovations are universal and fast-repeatable.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.720
If you can come up with something,

39:59.720 --> 40:03.720
then the opportunity to use your innovation is extremely small.

40:04.720 --> 40:05.720
For example,

40:05.720 --> 40:09.720
competitors can reproduce any new innovative product,

40:09.720 --> 40:11.720
and this is confirmed by Western specialists,

40:11.720 --> 40:13.720
in particular, by Philips,

40:14.720 --> 40:16.720
in just three months.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.720
Extremely fast.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.720
Information is overwhelming and devalued.

40:22.720 --> 40:23.720
Absolutely right.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.720
Go to a bookstore.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.720
You are not tormented by depression

40:28.720 --> 40:31.720
because so much literature has not yet been read.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.720
But it is because of its quantity

40:33.720 --> 40:36.720
that we often find it difficult to make decisions.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.720
We do not have time to get acquainted with all of it,

40:39.720 --> 40:44.720
and services that allow you to navigate

40:44.720 --> 40:47.720
and extract the most important information

40:47.720 --> 40:49.720
become more and more important.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.720
Light growth leads to great difficulties.

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
And it is true.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.720
A vivid example is Toyota.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.720
It has grown quite actively

40:59.720 --> 41:01.720
and moved in the rating of car manufacturers

41:01.720 --> 41:03.720
and has now taken the first place.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.720
But light growth has caused

41:06.720 --> 41:09.720
negative attitude of consumers.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.720
Having become number one,

41:11.720 --> 41:15.720
Toyota has lost its unique character for consumers.

41:16.720 --> 41:17.720
It has become mass-produced.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.720
And immediately complaints began

41:19.720 --> 41:21.720
about the quality of the product,

41:21.720 --> 41:23.720
the lack of competitive advantages.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.720
The consumption of consumers is less than in the past.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
And it is true.

41:29.720 --> 41:33.720
We will talk about the growth of our pace of life later.

41:33.720 --> 41:36.720
It means that companies also need to change

41:36.720 --> 41:39.720
the speed of responding to consumer requests.

41:39.720 --> 41:42.720
It is important to increase the speed of providing services

41:42.720 --> 41:43.720
and supplying goods.

41:54.720 --> 41:58.720
Marketing Mix

42:00.720 --> 42:03.720
Marketing Mix allows you to better imagine

42:03.720 --> 42:05.720
or to break a huge elephant's task

42:05.720 --> 42:07.720
into small details

42:08.720 --> 42:11.720
and formulate your market proposal.

42:12.720 --> 42:13.720
Pay attention to the slide.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.720
I drew a marketing mix in the form of a puzzle.

42:17.720 --> 42:18.720
It is really like that.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.720
You make a puzzle.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.720
And you need to create a unique picture for the consumer.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.720
The concept of marketing mix appeared in the 1950s

42:28.720 --> 42:30.720
in the university environment.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.720
Western professors thought it was easier to explain

42:36.720 --> 42:38.720
to students the success of a particular product.

42:39.720 --> 42:44.720
But this division of the product into individual components

42:45.720 --> 42:47.720
was so attractive

42:48.720 --> 42:51.720
that it was easier to analyze your market proposal

42:52.720 --> 42:53.720
and it became a business model.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.720
And it has remained unchanged to this day.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.720
The marketing mix consists of four components.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.720
The first one is a product.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.720
It is what you offer to the market.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.720
The second one is the price of the product.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.720
How much do you offer it to the consumer?

43:12.720 --> 43:17.720
The third one is the distribution channels

43:17.720 --> 43:20.720
or the place where you distribute the product.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.720
The fourth one is the promotion.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.720
The last one is the P, which is a part of the classic.

43:27.720 --> 43:29.720
It is how you promote a product to the market.

43:30.720 --> 43:34.720
The marketing mix is a set of variable marketing factors

43:35.720 --> 43:40.720
that companies use to create a desired response

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
from the target market.

43:43.720 --> 43:44.720
4P is an acronym.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.720
Product, Place, Price, Promotion.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.720
In fact, there were attempts to reproduce

43:53.720 --> 43:57.720
and teach other ways of division of the task

43:58.720 --> 43:59.720
of your proposal.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.720
In particular, the not very modified 4P

44:04.720 --> 44:06.720
is present in Jacques-Jean Lambin.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.720
He highlights the strategy of products,

44:09.720 --> 44:12.720
distribution, price formation and communication.

44:13.720 --> 44:17.720
At the same time, the English 4C includes

44:18.720 --> 44:19.720
the consumer,

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
convenience and availability,

44:23.720 --> 44:25.720
including distribution channels,

44:26.720 --> 44:27.720
cost, consumer costs,

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
a broader understanding,

44:30.720 --> 44:32.720
communication, how you deliver.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.720
Please note that they are not very different.

44:36.720 --> 44:40.720
It is not very unique to present

44:41.720 --> 44:46.720
the elements of your proposal to the client.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.720
If you are engaged in services,

44:50.720 --> 44:52.720
then three more P are important for you.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.720
People.

44:55.720 --> 44:58.720
Service depends on the people you provide.

44:59.720 --> 45:02.720
In particular, the Moscow retail has encountered

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
an interesting fact.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.720
The one who stands at the counter

45:07.720 --> 45:09.720
seriously affects the loyalty of the consumer

45:10.720 --> 45:12.720
and the desire to visit the store.

45:13.720 --> 45:16.720
The attempt to replace the sellers

45:17.720 --> 45:18.720
of the Slavic locality with immigrants

45:19.720 --> 45:22.720
led to the stores experiencing a shortage of consumers.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.720
And we had to quickly overhaul this situation.

45:27.720 --> 45:28.720
We want to buy similar ones.

45:29.720 --> 45:30.720
Physical evidence.

45:30.720 --> 45:31.720
Physical presence.

45:32.720 --> 45:33.720
It is extremely important,

45:34.720 --> 45:36.720
because the consumer evaluates the service

45:37.720 --> 45:38.720
by the appearance of your office.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.720
Imagine, you go to a bank

45:42.720 --> 45:44.720
that is a car on the outskirts of the city.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.720
And in front of you is a banker

45:48.720 --> 45:51.720
who manages this bank in shorts,

45:52.720 --> 45:53.720
crumpled T-shirt and flip-flops.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.720
Will such a bank trust you?

45:57.720 --> 45:58.720
Unlikely.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.720
Therefore, those who provide services

46:01.720 --> 46:03.720
try to convince the consumer

46:04.720 --> 46:06.720
that their service is of high quality.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.720
This is influenced by the appearance of the staff,

46:10.720 --> 46:11.720
the appearance of the office,

46:12.720 --> 46:14.720
the appearance of the signage and advertising.

46:15.720 --> 46:16.720
The service is unstable in time,

46:17.720 --> 46:20.720
the service is unstable in terms of its repetition,

46:21.720 --> 46:22.720
because it is provided by people.

46:23.720 --> 46:24.720
And here is a very important element.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.720
The stabilization of the quality of the service

46:28.720 --> 46:29.720
is the management of processes.

46:30.720 --> 46:31.720
Processes.

46:32.720 --> 46:35.720
This is the third additional P,

46:36.720 --> 46:39.720
which is important for the company that provides services.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.720
If you work in the B2B market,

46:42.720 --> 46:43.720
or sell expensive goods,

46:44.720 --> 46:45.720
long-term goods,

46:46.720 --> 46:48.720
then another P plays an important role for you.

46:49.720 --> 46:50.720
Personal selling.

46:51.720 --> 46:52.720
We talked about

46:52.720 --> 46:54.720
this is an extremely expensive way

46:55.720 --> 46:57.720
of communicating with consumers.

46:58.720 --> 46:59.720
The salary at the moment,

47:00.720 --> 47:01.720
or the cost of salary,

47:02.720 --> 47:03.720
occupies the first or second place

47:04.720 --> 47:05.720
in the budget of expenses

47:06.720 --> 47:07.720
of almost any Russian company.

47:08.720 --> 47:10.720
But in a number of markets,

47:11.720 --> 47:12.720
B2B or industrial markets,

47:13.720 --> 47:14.720
when selling expensive goods,

47:15.720 --> 47:16.720
it is the sellers

47:17.720 --> 47:19.720
who are able to implement your product.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.720
If you need to check your offer

47:23.720 --> 47:24.720
quickly enough,

47:25.720 --> 47:29.720
then it is useful to use a combination.

47:30.720 --> 47:31.720
4P plus 3C.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.720
No, not English C in this case,

47:35.720 --> 47:37.720
but additional elements.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.720
These are customers,

47:41.720 --> 47:42.720
competitors,

47:43.720 --> 47:44.720
company.

47:45.720 --> 47:47.720
Pay attention to the slide.

47:47.720 --> 47:49.720
You can draw a table,

47:50.720 --> 47:52.720
where you have columns,

47:53.720 --> 47:55.720
elements of the marketing complex,

47:56.720 --> 47:58.720
product, price, promotion, place,

47:59.720 --> 48:00.720
lines,

48:01.720 --> 48:03.720
customers, competitors, company.

48:04.720 --> 48:05.720
At the intersection,

48:06.720 --> 48:07.720
you get cells

48:08.720 --> 48:10.720
where you can write down questions.

48:11.720 --> 48:12.720
Let's see.

48:13.720 --> 48:14.720
Clients.

48:14.720 --> 48:18.720
What product do your clients want to get?

48:19.720 --> 48:23.720
At what price do they want to buy it?

48:24.720 --> 48:26.720
Where do they usually buy it?

48:27.720 --> 48:28.720
In which channels of sale?

48:29.720 --> 48:31.720
What kind of advertising are they ready to accept?

48:32.720 --> 48:33.720
What arguments do they need?

48:34.720 --> 48:35.720
Competitors.

48:36.720 --> 48:37.720
Will your competitors allow you

48:38.720 --> 48:39.720
and will you be able to differ

48:40.720 --> 48:41.720
to offer this product to the market?

48:42.720 --> 48:47.720
Will you be able to offer a competitive price?

48:48.720 --> 48:49.720
Will your competitors allow you

48:50.720 --> 48:52.720
to do this?

48:53.720 --> 48:55.720
Will you be able to use

48:56.720 --> 48:57.720
this data from the household channels?

48:58.720 --> 48:59.720
Will you be noticeable

49:00.720 --> 49:02.720
in this way of advertising?

49:03.720 --> 49:04.720
The last one is the company.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.720
Are you able to produce such a product?

49:08.720 --> 49:10.720
Will you be able to sell it at a price?

49:11.720 --> 49:12.720
What are the requirements of the consumer?

49:13.720 --> 49:15.720
Are you able to get into the channels?

49:16.720 --> 49:21.720
Are you able to use this way of promotion?

49:23.720 --> 49:24.720
The marketing complex

49:25.720 --> 49:26.720
or what you offer to the market

49:27.720 --> 49:28.720
is influenced by several factors.

49:29.720 --> 49:30.720
First of all, it's the consumers.

49:31.720 --> 49:32.720
Or the orientation of the consumer

49:33.720 --> 49:34.720
to make a purchase.

49:35.720 --> 49:37.720
Second, the dynamics of the industry development,

49:38.720 --> 49:39.720
behavior of sellers and retail traders.

49:39.720 --> 49:40.720
As a rule, their behavior determines

49:41.720 --> 49:43.720
the life cycle and the conditions of competition.

49:44.720 --> 49:46.720
Third, the position and behavior of competitors.

49:47.720 --> 49:48.720
If you are a big player,

49:49.720 --> 49:50.720
these are the conditions of competition.

49:51.720 --> 49:52.720
If you are a small player, then the other conditions.

49:53.720 --> 49:54.720
Fourth, the behavior of the authorities

49:55.720 --> 49:56.720
and the control over the marketing.

49:57.720 --> 49:58.720
Let's take a closer look at how

49:59.720 --> 50:00.720
the external environment can influence

50:01.720 --> 50:02.720
your marketing complex.

50:03.720 --> 50:04.720
A simple example.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
The legislative restriction of the use

50:07.720 --> 50:08.720
of advertising channels

50:09.720 --> 50:10.720
for beer, cigarettes,

50:11.720 --> 50:12.720
strong alcoholic beverages

50:13.720 --> 50:14.720
has greatly limited their ability

50:15.720 --> 50:16.720
to convey information

50:17.720 --> 50:19.720
about their products to us.

50:20.720 --> 50:23.720
Accordingly, they have to change

50:24.720 --> 50:25.720
their marketing complex.

50:26.720 --> 50:28.720
For cigarette manufacturers,

50:29.720 --> 50:32.720
the only way to convey information

50:33.720 --> 50:35.720
is the channel of the HRK,

50:36.720 --> 50:37.720
hotels, cafes, restaurants.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.720
That is, where we rest.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.720
If you look at the position of players,

50:44.720 --> 50:45.720
being a large player,

50:46.720 --> 50:49.720
you can dictate your conditions to the market.

50:50.720 --> 50:52.720
You need to spend less than a percent of your budget

50:53.720 --> 50:54.720
on advertising

50:55.720 --> 50:56.720
to remain the most noticeable.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.720
Smaller players need to focus

51:00.720 --> 51:02.720
either on certain channels of information,

51:03.720 --> 51:05.720
or look for alternatives

51:05.720 --> 51:08.720
to better convey information.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.720
Pay attention to the external environment.

51:12.720 --> 51:13.720
Pay attention to the slide.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.720
The marketing complex is always a compromise.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.720
The marketing complex can be represented

51:20.720 --> 51:24.720
or formulated as a perfect product.

51:25.720 --> 51:26.720
We ourselves want to get

51:27.720 --> 51:28.720
a high-quality product.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.720
We want to get a well-known product.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.720
Sometimes we talk about products

51:35.720 --> 51:37.720
that correspond to our image and social status.

51:38.720 --> 51:41.720
We want to get products that are available for purchase.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.720
It is desirable to purchase it

51:45.720 --> 51:48.720
either from home or from work,

51:49.720 --> 51:52.720
when there is no need to go somewhere for it.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.720
You can assume that this is a long-term demand product,

51:56.720 --> 51:58.720
from a warehouse, without long waiting.

51:59.720 --> 52:01.720
And the product is not cheap,

52:02.720 --> 52:03.720
it is not affordable.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.720
We can afford it.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.720
Formulating perfect products.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.720
Unfortunately, there is no perfect product at the moment,

52:13.720 --> 52:15.720
and we always have to look for a compromise.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.720
Pay attention to the fact that the leaders of the product categories,

52:19.720 --> 52:23.720
for example, the category of alcohol,

52:24.720 --> 52:25.720
cigarettes,

52:26.720 --> 52:28.720
and any other products,

52:28.720 --> 52:30.720
are always high-quality products,

52:31.720 --> 52:32.720
we, as consumers,

52:33.720 --> 52:36.720
are familiar with a large amount of advertising,

52:37.720 --> 52:38.720
with a well-known brand.

52:39.720 --> 52:41.720
These are products with a wide range of distribution,

52:42.720 --> 52:45.720
that is, they are present in many trading points,

52:46.720 --> 52:47.720
they are available.

52:48.720 --> 52:51.720
But these are never the cheapest products.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.720
Think about it.

52:54.720 --> 52:55.720
You can't name

52:55.720 --> 52:58.720
any leader of the category,

52:59.720 --> 53:01.720
which is both the cheapest product.

53:02.720 --> 53:03.720
Why?

53:04.720 --> 53:06.720
Because creating a high-quality product,

53:07.720 --> 53:09.720
investing in promotion,

53:10.720 --> 53:14.720
is the expense you had to bear.

53:16.720 --> 53:18.720
Accordingly, they did not affect the price.

53:19.720 --> 53:22.720
But this does not mean that there can be only such products on the market.

53:23.720 --> 53:24.720
There can be products,

53:25.720 --> 53:26.720
known,

53:27.720 --> 53:28.720
available for sale,

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
at an affordable price.

53:31.720 --> 53:32.720
But

53:33.720 --> 53:36.720
the manufacturer had to, most likely,

53:37.720 --> 53:38.720
act as a product.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.720
If we add other elements of the marketing complex,

53:42.720 --> 53:44.720
there can be an infinite number of variations.

53:45.720 --> 53:46.720
Which one to choose?

53:47.720 --> 53:48.720
In this case, you always need to pay attention,

53:49.720 --> 53:50.720
first of all, to the client.

53:51.720 --> 53:54.720
Because the client is your goal.

53:55.720 --> 53:59.720
And you should base your needs on the marketing complex.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.720
All marketing is, by and large, two questions.

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
Just two questions.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.720
Who will buy from me?

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
And why me?

54:10.720 --> 54:12.720
Simple questions, but it's hard to find an answer.

54:13.720 --> 54:14.720
When forming a marketing complex,

54:15.720 --> 54:18.720
as we said, you need to pay attention to the external environment.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.720
Namely,

54:20.720 --> 54:21.720
to the legislative base

54:22.720 --> 54:24.720
and competitors.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.720
What will they allow you to do?

54:27.720 --> 54:29.720
Will you be different in the competitive environment?

54:30.720 --> 54:33.720
You need to rely on the capabilities of your company.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.720
Are you able to do this?

54:36.720 --> 54:37.720
Do you have experience?

54:38.720 --> 54:39.720
What is important?

54:40.720 --> 54:42.720
Pay attention to the bottom half of the slide.

54:43.720 --> 54:45.720
It is important that this marketing complex

54:45.720 --> 54:49.720
provides economic benefits for the company.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.720
That is, it has passed the financial and economic analysis.

54:53.720 --> 54:57.720
Because the activity of your company is aimed at making a profit.

54:59.720 --> 55:00.720
Instead of a conclusion,

55:01.720 --> 55:02.720
pay attention to the slide.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.720
The chart you have studied in the economy.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.720
In finance.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.720
By changing the elements of the marketing complex,

55:11.720 --> 55:14.720
you change the parameters such as the total income.

55:15.720 --> 55:17.720
The total costs.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.720
That means you need to choose them in such a way

55:22.720 --> 55:26.720
to provide both the benefits for the client and the profit for the company.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.720
Let's take a look at a small example of the marketing complex.

55:32.720 --> 55:33.720
Some tasks.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.720
The first one.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.720
The direct costs for a unit of the product of a new product are $10.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.720
The indirect annual costs are $38,000.

55:43.720 --> 55:48.720
That is, the product is transferred from the residual costs of the business.

55:49.720 --> 55:50.720
And the indirect costs of the business.

55:51.720 --> 55:55.720
The lower price limit is determined as $16 per unit.

55:56.720 --> 56:00.720
At the same time, the upper price limit can be $24 per unit.

56:02.720 --> 56:04.720
The management is ready to allocate you

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
from $10,000 for each of the directions

56:08.720 --> 56:11.720
to $50,000 for the advertising and personal sales budget.

56:12.720 --> 56:15.720
That is, the advertising budget can vary from $10,000 to $50,000.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.720
You can see this condition on the slide.

56:19.720 --> 56:21.720
And there is also a calculation of the point of no loss.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.720
The formula for calculating the point of no loss, which we talked about.

56:26.720 --> 56:27.720
Pay attention to the slide.

56:28.720 --> 56:31.720
We have transferred the task conditions in the form of a tree of solutions.

56:32.720 --> 56:37.720
In particular, the price can vary from $24 to $16 per unit.

56:37.720 --> 56:43.720
In particular, the price can vary from $24 to $16 per unit.

56:44.720 --> 56:45.720
Two branches.

56:46.720 --> 56:53.720
The costs for personal sales can vary from $10,000 to $50,000.

56:54.720 --> 56:55.720
This is another branch.

56:56.720 --> 56:59.720
And the costs for advertising from $10,000 to $50,000.

57:00.720 --> 57:05.720
Accordingly, we get 5 points with certain characteristics.

57:05.720 --> 57:07.720
Read the coordinates.

57:08.720 --> 57:13.720
We can also calculate the point of no loss for each of the points.

57:14.720 --> 57:21.720
That is, at what volume of sales we will start to pay and get a profit.

57:22.720 --> 57:23.720
What do you think?

57:24.720 --> 57:26.720
At what point should we stop in this case?

57:28.720 --> 57:31.720
No, not at the lowest point of no loss.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.720
The point of no loss is given as a reference.

57:35.720 --> 57:37.720
We should focus on it with other equals.

57:38.720 --> 57:42.720
Other equals are the conditions under which the product will be successful in the market.

57:43.720 --> 57:46.720
Why? Because each condition is specific to a particular market.

57:47.720 --> 57:48.720
Pay attention.

57:49.720 --> 57:54.720
The price is $16, the costs for personal sales are $10, the costs for advertising are $10.

57:55.720 --> 58:02.720
As a rule, this is a highly competitive market for consumer goods at the final stage of life.

58:02.720 --> 58:09.720
Consumers know the product well and such elements as personal sales or advertising are not important for them.

58:10.720 --> 58:13.720
They will choose based solely on the cost.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.720
The point is $16, $10, $50.

58:17.720 --> 58:25.720
That is, $16 is the price, $10 is the costs for personal sales, $50 is the costs for advertising.

58:25.720 --> 58:41.720
This is typical for a player who enters a highly competitive market and wants to set his goal and see the opportunity to win this market through more intensive advertising and a better offer in terms of price.

58:42.720 --> 58:52.720
$16 for advertising, $50 for personal sales, $10 for advertising.

58:52.720 --> 59:03.720
This is the sale of goods or services on a highly competitive market at the final stage of market life, provided that the consumer's opinion is important for us as consumers.

59:04.720 --> 59:16.720
We are guided by the opinion of the seller when purchasing goods of long-term demand, when purchasing goods that are important to us, but we are not guided by them, we are not experts.

59:17.720 --> 59:28.720
$16 for the price and high costs, $50 for personal sales and $50,000 for advertising.

59:29.720 --> 59:38.720
This is a characteristic point for a highly competitive market where personal sales and the popularity of the product are important for the consumer.

59:39.720 --> 59:50.720
Let's consider the extreme point of $24 for the price, $50,000 for advertising and $50,000 for personal sales.

59:50.720 --> 01:00:07.720
This is a growing market, we can set high prices where demand is high and growing, but at the same time consumers are still poorly oriented in the product and it is necessary to conduct an information campaign.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:13.720
You are interested in when you can use a point with minimal loss.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.720
High price, low cost of advertising.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:25.720
This is a situation when you are an innovator on the market, when you have practically no competitors, and the product is in demand.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.720
That is, you are very much in the needs of consumers, you did not have to form them.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.720
If you look at the modern marketing complex, it has not changed much, but has expanded.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:44.720
In particular, additional elements have now appeared that you need to consider in your market proposal.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:51.720
Of course, the marketing complex could not remain without the attention of Philip Kotler.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.720
In particular, he added two points here.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720
This is politics.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.720
Politics can significantly affect your sales, you should consider it when forming a marketing complex.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:19.720
For example, if American companies plan to enter the market of Arab countries, where the attitude to the US policy is extremely negative, they will have to look for local partners, change brands, that is, change their marketing complex.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.720
The policy of the state will interfere.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:32.720
At the same time, the policy of the United States allowed American transnational corporations to enter the Russian market quite easily during the perestroika.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.720
We were actually waiting for them, and they were a breath of freedom for us.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720
Public opinion.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.720
It can both help and interfere with the company.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.720
New moods and attitudes can appear in society, which affect its interest in certain goods or services.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.720
Society cares about the problems of ecology?

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.720
You will have to prove that you share the opinion of society and confirm this with actions.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.720
Society is interested in the problems of sexual minorities?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:10.720
Well, you will have to join this opinion and demonstrate that you are an excellent employer for this category of employees.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.720
FedPodcorn adds another point.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720
Policy.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.720
The confirmation of the company's statement.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.720
Here is the personal ethics of the owners and managers.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.720
How do you treat your employees?

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.720
How much money does the chief executive officer allocate to political campaigns and which candidates?

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:43.720
That is, if you supply child food to the market, then you should most likely divide and behave as your customers expect from you.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:55.720
If the manufacturer, the owner of the company that produces child toys, behaves in an inappropriate way, I am afraid that consumers may turn away from him.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.720
Lars Twede suggests that pace is one of the key elements of the modern marketing complex.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.720
Research has been conducted several times that proves that the speed of our life is seriously changing.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.720
Yes, it depends on the geography where you are.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:24.720
If you come to Moscow or leave Moscow for the regions, you can feel the difference in the pace of life in two different places.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.720
But everyone agrees on one thing.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.720
The speed of our life has increased, which means that you need to take this into account.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:46.720
That is, be closer to the consumer geographically, respond to his requests faster, allow him to spend less time on the acquisition that he needs.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:54.720
And online trading often allows you to be more competitive precisely because of the speed.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.720
I can order the goods and services I need without leaving my desk.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.720
Seth Godin adds four more new P's.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.720
1. Voluntary.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.720
The art of communicating with people who want to be interacted with.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.720
For this, personal and relevant messages should be used.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:28.720
That is, first of all, you should gain trust and appreciate the trust of people who agreed to receive advertising messages from you.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:35.720
And it means that these advertising messages should be necessary for them and you should be honest with your consumers.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720
2. Value Voluntary.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:49.720
Paradigm is a frightening practice of breaking the old rules, the actions of your industry and creating new rules, thanks to which the actions of your competitors are outdated.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.720
Look what's going on. The world is changing.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.720
And we see a number of examples of companies that combine seemingly impossible things.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.720
A vivid example is Apple, which has introduced a number of innovations to the market.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.720
This is the production of mp3 players and the delivery of music at the same time.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.720
This is a modern iPhone, which is essentially a multifunctional device.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.720
This is the policy of promotion of these devices.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.720
Change! Try to re-examine the old stereotypes of the industry, look for innovations.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.720
Pass on the virus marketing.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:40.720
Recognizing the fact that the only and the best way to improve your business is to help your customers tell others about your products.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.720
Yes, we really trust the opinions of our colleagues.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.720
We trust the experts on the Internet forums.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.720
We trust the consumers who already use these services.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:06:00.720
Unfortunately, there are not enough clear technologies that allow to manage or assess the effectiveness of rumors.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:12.720
Nevertheless, let your customers, satisfied consumers, of course satisfied consumers, tell about your company, about your offer.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:20.720
At the same time, Seth Godin says that if you could not break the paradigm, there is another PIP – practice.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:35.720
The idea is that by testing, measuring and changing the product you offer, you can grow and change much more dynamically than your rivals, tied to the old ways of doing business.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.720
Measure and manage your efficiency.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.720
The efficiency of customer service.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.720
Stan Rapp and Chuck Martin add the following.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.720
Address.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.720
Or not quite the correct translation of what they wanted to say.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:07:04.720
They claim that the one who is able to better define his target segment, the group on which he needs to focus, will win in the market.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720
Accountability.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Or the measurability of what you do.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Ask yourself a question.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.720
How easily do you measure the result?

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.720
How easily can you manage the process, measure the efficiency of the process that leads to the result?

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720
Why?

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.720
Because it is on the basis of the accuracy of the measurement that you can improve.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.720
The ability to implement.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720
Evaluation.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:44.720
Have you learned, can you test all your ideas absolutely reliably and select only those that are most likely to be successful?

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.720
Availability.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:54.720
How can you identify people on whom you want to go out and find out what they are ready to wish and able to receive your message?

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.720
How do you convey your ideas?

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.720
Marketing.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.720
We've talked about how it is big and different.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:14.720
It is well-developed, but nevertheless there are problems that prevent it from being really effective.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.720
Let's talk about them.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.720
Pay attention to the slide.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.720
Why marketing does not bring the expected result?

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.720
Yes, there are many points and they are different.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.720
This is what marketers face every day.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.720
First of all, there is a lack of understanding and support from the owner and the company's first person.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:46.720
We've talked about the fact that the owner, the manager, is the most important and the main marketer in the company, and all the other people are his assistants.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.720
Lack of competence from the management.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.720
They do not understand what you offer.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.720
They cannot evaluate, they cannot give you the right tasks.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:03.720
We face situations when marketers are hired by the company and they offer to come up with what they will do.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:11.720
You cannot hire a person without understanding what functions he will perform and what result he can bring to the company.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.720
The number of marketers in the company is extremely small.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:26.720
Pay attention to the slide with the statistics of the ratio of the number of staff in the company and marketing in the West.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.720
And we have 1-2, but the volume of tasks is often no less.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.720
They just can't cope, causing negative attitude to marketing.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.720
You can continue this list.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.720
These are the problems we face every day.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.720
Learn to see them, learn to correct them.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:56.720
Try to avoid the reports of the researches that come to your company to be a dead weight.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.720
It is important to make decisions based on the results of this analysis.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.720
If we talk about the problem of orientation to the market,

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:18.720
then first of all, you need to teach the employees what is the essence of the orientation to the market.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.720
If you cannot convey the understanding of client-orientedness to your colleagues,

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.720
I'm afraid that you won't be able to convince me as a consumer.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.720
First of all, focus on your colleagues.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:42.720
Second, most of the employees don't know how their responsibilities and functions affect the client-orientedness of the company.

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:48.720
Most of the functions don't understand the importance of others and, first of all, don't understand the importance of marketing in the company.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.720
I've heard the following statement many times,

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:58.720
that marketing is a department that is directed either to the criminals or to their relatives.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.720
Accordingly, your ideas will not be supported in the company as long as there is such an opinion.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.720
Accordingly, one of the tasks of marketing is internal marketing,

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.720
internal marketing of the consumer's value.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.720
Before we start discussing competitiveness, let's define what a strategy is.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:40.720
Because it is within the framework of the company's strategy that we manage competitiveness.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.720
It is in this context that it is important to us.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.720
What is a strategy? You will consider in more detail a little later.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.720
Therefore, I will allow only some brief moments.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720
In the words of Michael Porter,

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.720
a strategy is a unique value proposition for the clients that the company creates.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.720
It is a chain of creating value,

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:15.720
clear compromises and determining what the company will not do.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:23.720
These actions are combined with each other and mutually enhance the effect of constant positioning.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:31.720
Please note that the strategy is aimed at creating distinctive features of the company in the minds of consumers.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.720
Moreover, for these abilities, they must be ready to pay their money.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.720
So far, the theory is based on only one thing,

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.720
that the word competition came from the Latin word to face.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.720
In the classical sense, competition is an economic process of interaction,

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.720
communication and struggle between enterprises in the market

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.720
in order to ensure the best possible sales of their products,

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.720
satisfying the various needs of the buyer.

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.720
Please note that the understanding of the strategy and competition are intermittently connected.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.720
Let's go a little into the history of the concept of competition.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.720
Engels gave a very interesting definition of competition.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.720
Competition is the most complete expression of the war of all against all in modern civil society.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.720
At the same time, Marx says that competition is different.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.720
The first type of competition is between entrepreneurs

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.720
who produce the same goods for the best conditions of production and sales,

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720
for the gain of super profits.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.720
The second type of competition is between entrepreneurs

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.720
who are busy in various industries due to the profitable application of capital for redistribution of profits.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.720
Please note that Marx divides the types of competition,

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.720
and this is an extremely important point, which we will discuss a little later.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.720
If we talk about competitiveness as a derivative of competition,

01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.720
then it is the property of objects that characterizes the degree of satisfaction of a particular need

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.720
compared to the best similar objects presented in this market.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.720
This definition was given by our compatriot Mr. Foskudinov.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.720
At the same time, if we look at the Western formulations,

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.720
then competitiveness is the ability of a country or a company to sell its goods.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.720
There are many definitions.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.720
How do we figure out what competitiveness is?

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.720
Let's first of all focus on the most pleasant and practical definition

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.720
formulated by the European Forum on Management Problems.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:40.720
So, competitiveness is the real or potential ability of companies

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.720
to design, manufacture and sell goods

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:52.720
that are more attractive to the consumer than the goods of their competitors.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.720
Please note that this definition is applied not only at the present moment, but also in the future.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.720
Competitors differ in level.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.720
Why did we come across different definitions?

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.720
The country, the company, everything is correct.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.720
Here, Marx was right and defined a certain situation.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.720
He gave a more precise definition of competition and competitiveness.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.720
Please note that competition is divided into levels.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:28.720
The micro-level is the competition of goods or the competition of companies.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.720
The definitions for each type of competition will be different.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.720
The macro-level is the competition of the state and the region.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:51.720
Competitiveness depends on the properties of the goods of the states and regions.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.720
Competition between regions is very interesting.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:01.720
For example, it is believed that Japan's success in microelectronics lies in the deep historical past,

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.720
in the ability of the Japanese to miniaturize.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:14.720
Or another option is the competitiveness of China as a fairly efficient manufacturer.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.720
Moreover, the Russian company that produces snacks took measurements

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.720
and came across an interesting fact.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.720
Russian workers perform operations three times slower than Chinese.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.720
And there is nothing you can do about it.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.720
It is a historical ability to compete.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:45.720
And, as a rule, your strategy should be based on the existing competitiveness of the company, state and region.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.720
If we talk about the key factors of success,

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.720
which are the ones we are guided by,

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.720
which are the ones we evaluate the competitiveness of your goods or companies,

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.720
then the University of Sheffield has conducted a study and formulated the following factors of success.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.720
Please note the following slide.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.720
These are the price, quality, care for customers and services,

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.720
feedback to consumers, delivery and availability,

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.720
variety of products and new products and services.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.720
Please note that in this case there is no orange.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.720
These are the key factors of success in general.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.720
In one of the markets, the price is decisive,

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:31.720
and in another, new products and services are the main ability of the company

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.720
to meet the needs of the customer better than others.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.720
Think about it.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.720
What are the key factors of success in your industry,

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.720
which we should measure and evaluate first?

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.720
What do you do better than your competitors?

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:55.720
In Russia, there was a study on the evaluation of competitiveness

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.720
and the attitude to the competition of our enterprises.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.720
Please note the following slide.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.720
You can see the graph on it,

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.720
which reflects the level of indifference of enterprises to the factors of competition.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.720
The higher the value, the less attention is paid to this factor.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:21.720
It is disappointing that the patent-based know-how

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.720
has fallen out of the sphere of our enterprises' attention.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.720
But at the same time, they are focused on the level of quality of the product

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.720
and blame their failures or achievements for the change in the price of raw materials

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720
and energy.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.720
They fight for the quality of the product.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.720
When the best companies in the world manage not only the quality of the product,

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.720
but also the life expectancy,

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.720
they already care about other components,

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.720
and quality is not a determining factor of competition.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:02.720
I think we should reconsider the main points of competitiveness of our enterprises

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.720
and focus on the ability to earn in the future.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.720
After all, it is your patents and innovations that provide you with future income.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.720
The level of quality is a result of the past,

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:21.720
which does not reflect your ability to meet the needs of customers in the future.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.720
In particular, the results of the study show

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:33.720
the main factors that influenced competitiveness in 2005-2006.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.720
According to the entrepreneurs,

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.720
the level of quality of the product

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.720
allowed to satisfy the needs of the customer,

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.720
to establish a connection with the customers,

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:53.720
and the factors related to the change in the price of raw materials and energy

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720
and transport tariffs influenced negatively.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.720
Accordingly, enterprises are used to

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.720
focus on competitiveness provided by the state or the region.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.720
This means that they are dependent on the change of these factors

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.720
and can lose the market for these reasons.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.720
For reasons they do not control.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.720
At the same time, the indicators of the presence of competitive advantage

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.720
are, first of all, market leadership or market segment.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.720
If consumers choose you,

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.720
it means that you have something that allows you to satisfy the needs of customers

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:33.720
much better than others.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:41.720
The sign of competitive advantage and the main indicator is the growing share of the market.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:48.720
If the sales rates of your company are ahead of the growth rates of competitors,

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.720
it means that you attract more and more consumers

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.720
due to the higher competitiveness.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.720
At the same time, if you strive to maximize profits,

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.720
you can focus on higher profits compared to other companies.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:14.720
That is, you do not win by growth, but by increased profits compared to competitors.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.720
A stronger brand, more loyal consumers,

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:19.720
the degree of retention of consumers

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.720
is also an indicator of the competitiveness of your offer to your company on the market.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.720
In particular, there are a number of approaches to calculate the competitiveness of a product.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.720
At the moment, the approaches related to the economy are leading.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.720
It is the economic motives.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:48.720
Let's consider a way to calculate competitiveness based on a number of characteristics, a number of signs.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.720
Pay attention to the slide.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.720
First of all, we calculate the group indicator of competitiveness by normative parameters.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.720
Normative parameters or standards are the requirements for the product.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.720
In this case, we assign a sign 0 or 1,

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.720
depending on whether this characteristic is present or not.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:15.720
Accordingly, the group indicator of competitiveness by normative parameters is the share of a unit.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720
It cannot exceed a unit.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:23.720
The share of a unit characterizes the presence of a certain mandatory sign.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:30.720
Let's also calculate the group indicator of competitiveness by normative parameters, which we will need.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:37.720
In this case, we take into account not only the relationship of the characteristics of your offer to the ideal,

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.720
in comparison with which we compare ourselves,

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.720
but also the weight of this characteristic in the final indicator.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.720
That is, not all characteristics of the product are equally important for the consumer,

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.720
and accordingly we must correct.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.720
In this case, we multiply the specific indicator of competitiveness by technical goods

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:06.720
by the weight of this parameter in the total set of all technical parameters.

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.720
As a result, we get a value that fluctuates around a unit.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.720
That is, it can be more or less than a unit.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:17.720
To calculate the integral indicator of competitiveness,

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.720
we also need the relationship of your product to the sample,

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.720
with which we compare ourselves, in terms of costs.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.720
In this case, this is a group indicator in terms of economic parameters.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.720
Under the cost, we understand all the costs of the consumer,

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.720
which are associated with the purchase of your product or service.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:48.720
Here can be not only costs, but also the cost of ownership,

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:54.720
the cost of retraining staff, the cost of changing the infrastructure of the enterprise,

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.720
if this is production equipment associated with the replacement of equipment.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.720
As a result, we can calculate the integral indicator of the competitiveness of the product.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.720
Pay attention to the formula, which is shown on the slide.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:14.720
This is the ratio of competitiveness by normative parameters,

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:19.720
multiplied by competitiveness by technical parameters,

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.720
and divided by competitiveness by economic parameters.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.720
That is, this integral indicator reflects the difference between

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.720
comparing the product in the consumer effect,

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.720
and the consumer cost per unit of the consumer,

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.720
when purchasing and consuming the product.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.720
You can find more detailed information in the methodological task,

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:48.720
and calculate this indicator for your products or services.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:57.720
At the same time, one of the first approaches,

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.720
which allowed to measure the competitiveness of businesses,

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.720
was the matrix of the Boston Consulting Group.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:06.720
Pay attention to the slide.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.720
This matrix will be studied within the framework of strategic planning.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:19.720
But I dare to remind you that it appeared in the early 70s,

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.720
when American companies had to evaluate the competitiveness of their businesses

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.720
and leave those that have a high competitiveness

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:36.720
and are able to ensure the survival of the corporation.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:41.720
This matrix is based on the effect of experience and scale.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:46.720
The cheaper the product you can produce due to these effects,

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.720
the more competitive it is, and on growth rates,

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.720
that is, in the opinion of consumers.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.720
A similar matrix, McKinsey General Electric,

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:00.720
appeared in the same 70s.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.720
But its difference from the matrix of the Boston Consulting Group

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.720
is that it can use soft criteria, soft assessments,

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.720
and a set of criteria is practically unlimited

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.720
to assess the competitiveness of the product.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720
Pay attention to the slide.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.720
In this case, two axes are also used.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.720
The first is the strong sides of the business,

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:22.720
its competitiveness,

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.720
the client's view of the business,

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.720
that is, why should I buy a product from this company,

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:35.720
and the market attractiveness of a particular segment or business for the owners.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:42.720
You can see this matrix in more detail in the course of our program.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.720
There are quite a few models.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.720
In particular, it is worth referring to the little-known,

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.720
but in my opinion, an interesting model,

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.720
the Fishbane model.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.720
The Fishbane model is one of the models of assessing the competitiveness of the product.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.720
I talk about such models quite a lot,

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.720
and you can find their description in various literature.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.720
The Fishbane model, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting,

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:09.720
because it actually reflects,

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:15.720
or is a mathematical expression of the behavior of the consumer.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.720
In addition to the importance of a particular criterion for the client,

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:22.720
differentiation is also calculated,

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.720
and the importance is actually as a determination of this criterion.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:36.720
Namely, the parameters by which the offer of your product is most strongly different are enhanced.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.720
I will give an example that allows you to evaluate this model.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.720
If you choose a mortgage loan,

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.720
then most likely one of the first and most important characteristics that you will name

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.720
is the interest rate on the loan.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.720
The second parameter is the speed of decision-making on the loan.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.720
And the third parameter, for example,

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.720
is the distance to the bank branch from your new home.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:10.720
Accordingly, if the banks were primarily oriented towards interest rates,

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.720
then we would face the fact that they are almost all the same.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:23.720
And accordingly, such parameters as the interest rate and the speed of decision-making

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.720
are not decisive or important for the consumer.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.720
All banks offer approximately the same thing.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:36.720
But the most important factor for the consumer would be the distance to the bank branch.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.720
Why? Because he takes a loan once, and he will have to pay the rest of the 15 years.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.720
This model allows you to identify such behavioral characteristics.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.720
Let's take a closer look at one of the ways to compare your competitiveness

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:55.720
and manage business efficiency as a benchmark.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.720
Generally speaking, you need to constantly assess the competitiveness of these goods

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.720
at this particular moment, the competitiveness of the processes.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.720
Benchmarking is a comparative marketing,

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.720
a comparative analysis of your companies, your business processes,

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.720
and the processes of your competitors, as well as the best representatives from other industries.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.720
Please note that it is important for you to take into account

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.720
not only the current characteristics of the goods or services,

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.720
but also their changes over time.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.720
Perhaps, the competitor that is currently losing to you in terms of characteristics

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.720
is developing more dynamically and at some point will win the market.

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.720
Benchmarking has also undergone a certain evolution.

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.720
It all started with the assessment, even with qualitative financial assessments,

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.720
of various businesses.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720
What is the profit? What is the turnover?

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.720
Please note that this idea existed until the 1960s.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.720
Then they began to assess the efficiency.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.720
There were such indicators as ROI, return on investment, and its production.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.720
We talked about the fact that the strategy of the enterprise

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.720
that achieves results with less resources is more effective.

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:22.720
In 1983, Xerox began to benchmark based on processes.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.720
That is, it is equal to the best representatives of its branch and other industries

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720
for improving processes.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:36.720
It was Xerox that became the pioneer of the approach that is used today.

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.720
Benchmarking is a comparison of the practice and characteristics of an organization

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.720
with the practice and indicators of other organizations

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:47.720
in order to find ways to improve their activities.

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:54.720
The main idea of benchmarking is to consciously go beyond the limits of your market,

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720
beyond the limits of your industry.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:58.720
Because by comparing to the best of your industry,

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.720
you can become the same if you reach the limits.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.720
Going beyond the limits of the industry, looking wider,

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.720
you can become the best of your industry.

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:12.720
Therefore, comparing to your industry is not all.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:17.720
Assess the best of similar processes, similar operations,

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.720
and think about how to transfer it to your business.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:27.720
Resultiveness is the production of the right output product.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:33.720
Effectiveness is the production of the right output product with minimal costs.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.720
It is important to understand that you should not only achieve results,

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.720
but also spend as little effort as possible.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.720
It is important to understand that you cannot be effective

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720
if you do not achieve the overall result.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.720
Benchmarking has different types.

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.720
The internal one is a comparison of similar processes within the organization.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.720
Here you can also find ways to improve.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:02.720
In Western companies, there are even people who are not engaged in anything.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:06.720
They just travel around the regions and watch how different departments

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.720
perform the same processes.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:13.720
They find deviations in the best direction and try to replicate them throughout the company.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.720
Competitive is a comparison of the strongest of direct competitors.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:22.720
Functional is a comparison of company methods with similar processes

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.720
related to the same function outside the industry

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.720
in which your company operates.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:33.720
Process is a comparison of working processes with innovative,

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.720
worthy of increased attention,

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.720
working processes of other companies.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:45.720
For example, to compare processes and to pay attention to the table on the slide,

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.720
you can use a certain matrix.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.720
We look at the market, what clients ask for.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:57.720
Process is a process of solving problems.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.720
From what has been done, we look at how we satisfied the client,

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.720
but it is also important to have quality criteria,

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.720
for example, the percentage of repeated purchases.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:13.720
By highlighting such processes, we highlight, first of all,

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.720
what we measure, how we measure, and try to understand

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.720
what we can improve in our company.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.720
AXE-Rex conducts regular analysis of business processes up to now.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.720
But in order to make this task regular,

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.720
it is necessary to formalize the list of processes used for analysis.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:38.720
In AXE-Rex, everything starts with market management or marketing,

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:40.720
which we are talking about.

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:43.720
In the second place, the most important thing for them is to treat the client.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.720
The rest of the processes are typical for this company,

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.720
you can see on the slide.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.720
Most often, processes are studied related to the service of the client,

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.720
the efficiency of the use of information technologies,

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.720
the development and training of the staff,

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.720
how important are the competitiveness components,

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.720
which are aimed at earning money in the future,

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.720
the improvement of management processes,

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.720
the costs for managing the company,

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:16.720
the work of call centers and other ways of feedback with consumers,

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.720
the assessment of the efficiency of the work of various departments,

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:27.720
the assessment of the costs for attracting and attracting staff,

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.720
the functions of production, staff management and project management.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:36.720
If we look at benchmarking as a process,

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.720
then, first of all, you need to determine the process intended for comparison,

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.720
that is, for benchmarking,

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.720
where we will look for the best partners,

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.720
by which process.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.720
The second step is to determine the partners,

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.720
that is, who we compare with.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.720
The third step is to collect information,

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:59.720
measure the efficiency of our partner's processes,

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.720
collect information on how he performs the process.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.720
The fourth step is to measure the gap,

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.720
that is, how far we are behind.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.720
The fifth step is to prescribe future characteristics,

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.720
that is, what we should achieve as a result of the change of our company.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.720
We set operational tasks,

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.720
namely, the cycle of response time,

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:27.720
the maximum acceptable level of errors for our process,

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.720
the total consumption of resources within the process of change, and so on.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.720
It is important not to miss such a stage as training staff

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.720
to a new way of performing this process.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.720
Of course, the eighth step is monitoring of the results

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.720
of these changes and this process.

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.720
But here the cycle closes

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.720
and the process must be tested on a regular basis.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.720
If we look at the object-oriented approach of DEC,

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.720
it consists of four stages.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.720
Pay attention to the slide.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.720
They also determine what is subject to benchmarking.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.720
At the second stage, they determine,

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.720
based on what they will compare,

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.720
how they will perform the benchmarking.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.720
At the third stage, they identify the best,

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.720
in principle, the best on the market,

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.720
who perform this process.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:24.720
And then they try to understand how this enterprise,

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.720
better than others,

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.720
achieves these results.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.720
For benchmarking,

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.720
both internal data of the company itself

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.720
and external data are used,

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:42.720
which they are trying to collect.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.720
It is important to understand the basic principles of benchmarking.

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:51.720
You will ask, who will provide us with information,

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.720
who will want to let us work on their production.

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.720
It's very simple.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.720
Benchmarking can be mutual.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.720
This is one of the basic principles.

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.720
That is, by giving the opportunity to compare with someone,

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.720
you can ask for a response.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.720
Of course, it is unlikely to talk about your strongest competitor,

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.720
or even the worst competitor, as they say sometimes.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:18.720
But it is possible to cooperate with enterprises from other industries,

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.720
where you are not direct competitors.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.720
This cooperation, based on mutuality,

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.720
allows you to achieve excellent results together.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.720
The second principle is analogies.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.720
Make analogies with other industries.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.720
Show your imagination.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:42.720
Look for what your competitors have not seen yet.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.720
The third principle is measurability.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.720
How can you manage efficiency without measuring?

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.720
You should always have key indicators

01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:52.720
on which you make comparisons.

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:54.720
The fourth principle is reliability.

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:56.720
Recheck.

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.720
Recheck what is really so.

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.720
Unfortunately, in professional literature,

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.720
in magazines, often the materials are not real,

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.720
but the materials are in the form of PR.

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.720
When you face real processes in companies,

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.720
they are far from what is described in glossy magazines.
