00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
We have seen the second part of our lecture.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
We have seen growth strategies.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
And now we are moving to the third part of our lecture,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
namely, to competitive strategies.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Dear colleagues, I would like to remind you

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
that today we are looking at business strategies

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
that are divided into three sub-types.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
These are portfolio strategies, growth strategies and competitive strategies.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
We have already discussed two sub-types.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
These are portfolio strategies.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
We have also discussed growth strategies.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
I would like to remind you that we have discussed integration,

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
diversification,

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
leadership through either

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
deferences or differentiation and specialization.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Now we are moving to competitive strategies.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Competitive strategies determine

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
how to provide enterprises with competitive advantages on the market

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
in terms of attracting potential consumers

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
and what policy should be chosen by the company

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
in order to compete with competitors.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
When we talk about competitive strategies,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
we cannot but mention competitive advantages.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
We have already discussed the acquisition of competitive advantages,

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
the specialization strategies,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
differentiation strategies,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
and the acquisition and reduction of costs.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Nevertheless, this is necessary in this block of strategies.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
What are competitive advantages?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
These are the characteristics of the company's market activity

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
that create a certain superiority over competitors

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
and allow to obtain the desired profit

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
and maintain a strong position on the market.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
According to the general competitive matrix of the porter,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
competitive advantages can be achieved

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
either through product leadership,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
price leadership, or niche leadership.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
As for product leadership,

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
we have already discussed that it can be achieved in different ways.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
It can be either reduction of costs,

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
or achievement of differential advantage,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
or concentration.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Price leadership is, most likely, reduction of costs.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
And niche leadership is concentration of activity.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
In this case, we are talking about the fact

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
that growth strategies that we have just discussed

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
and competitive strategies are interconnected.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
One strategy flows into another.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
In this case, it is very difficult to divide

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
the growth strategies between competitors.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Because when a company develops and grows,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
it tries to achieve competitive advantage.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
The general competitive matrix of the porter is presented as follows.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
How can we achieve competitive advantage?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Reduction of costs, differential advantage,

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
price leadership, product leadership,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and niche leadership.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
We will discuss each type of leadership.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Product leadership can be achieved

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
by differentiating, improving the product,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
packaging, design, and so on.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Price leadership is a game with prices,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
reduction of costs, standardization of quality,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
and management of costs.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
In this case, I would like to note

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
that the use of the law of experience and scale

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
should be used by companies.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
Niche leadership is focusing on certain niches.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Niche is a part of the segment that has not yet been identified

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
and the needs of which have not yet been satisfied.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
For example, the niche is a shampoo for oily hair.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Niche is a shampoo for oily hair.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
This is the satisfaction of specific needs

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
that have not yet been satisfied.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
As soon as they are satisfied,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
the niche grows into segments.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
The niche leadership is often used

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
by small business enterprises.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Large companies sometimes find it difficult

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
to segment their customers in a thorough way.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Even after a thorough segmentation,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
large companies do not choose these segments

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
as their target markets, especially niches.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Small companies, realizing their competitive advantage,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
choose niches or small segments as their target segments.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
These are the segments that they pay close attention to

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
and work with.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
The possible strategy for achieving

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
and maintaining competitive advantage

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
is represented in the matrix of competitive advantages.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
We will present them in the table.

05:27.000 --> 05:37.000
The table consists of three main graphs.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
These are market positions,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
the prevailing strategy and the passive strategy.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
In the market positions,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
companies can occupy three main positions.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
These are the companies that pursue market leaders

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
and companies that avoid direct competition.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
As Kotler says, the type of strategy chosen

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
depends on the position and share of the market

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
that the company occupies.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
The company leader will be a large company

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
that occupies a leading position,

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
that conducts its marketing strategy aggressively

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
and that chooses large target segments

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
and works with them.

06:21.000 --> 06:31.000
We will be interested in two other types of companies,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
the companies that pursue or pursue market leaders

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and the companies that avoid direct competition.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
The companies that pursue market leaders

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
are those that realize that they cannot become market leaders,

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
but they use strategies similar to those of market leaders

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
or simply attack.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
The companies that avoid direct competition

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
are, most likely, medium-sized or even small companies

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
that realize that due to their size

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
they cannot compete with a large company,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
with a leader,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
and they choose such a strategy

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
to avoid competition

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
and find niche segments and work with them.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
The companies that pursue market leaders

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
are those that do not occupy a dominant position,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
but can challenge such a leader.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
The companies that avoid direct competition

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
are those that agree with their position on the market.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
If we look at this table,

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
we will see that there are two types of strategies.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
We see a persuasive strategy and a passive strategy.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
The persuasive strategy is the strategy that companies use

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
to defend themselves,

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
to somehow bite the leader, so to speak.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And the passive strategy is the strategy

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
that simply follows the leader,

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
when small companies just go and use their position

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
without making any sudden movements,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
just follow the course.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
We see that the companies that pursue market leaders

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
use such persuasive strategies as attack, breakthrough and encirclement.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And the passive strategy is the course-following strategy.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And the companies that avoid direct competition

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
use such persuasive strategies as concentration on the site or bypass.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And the passive strategy is to keep their position.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
We will look at these strategies

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
using the example of the stable strategy of small and medium-sized companies.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So we move on to the last section of our lecture

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
and talk about the stable strategy of small and medium-sized companies.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
The Stable Strategy of Small and Medium-Sized Companies

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
First, let's define what small and medium-sized companies are.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
What are these companies?

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
These are companies that occupy small or medium shares of the market.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
They either cannot or do not even seek to take a leading position.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
These are companies that either work in local markets or national markets

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
or in some narrow geographic markets

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
and do not seek to expand their positions.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
But this does not mean that these companies do not have any weight

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
and do not occupy any positions.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Absolutely not.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
They can even compete with the leaders

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
by providing some advantages to their competitors.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
By their specialization.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Let's look at some strategies that small and medium-sized companies use.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
We have already said that there are two types of strategies.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
There is a persuasive strategy and a passive strategy.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
The persuasive strategy of a company that is a leader-hunter

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
is a frontal attack.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
The strategy is that the company uses the same means against its competitor

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
that the leader uses and tries to find weak spots.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
In order to be successful, this frontal attack requires a significant superiority of the attacker.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
In order to achieve superiority over the leader,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
a certain ratio is necessary.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Usually, it is 3 to 1 in order to determine the competitor's advantage.

10:52.000 --> 11:02.000
To be honest, I must say that a frontal attack is a rather risky strategy

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
because companies may not calculate their opportunities.

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
If they do not have this product-price superiority

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
or this superiority in distribution and this ratio of 3 to 1,

11:18.000 --> 11:29.000
they may not achieve their goals and may not be able to defeat the leader.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
I must say that many small companies tried to attack the leaders,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
but they did not succeed.

11:38.000 --> 11:46.000
Nevertheless, there are examples of successful use of this strategy.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
For example, the ABM company, which was at its initial stage,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
started its attack on the computer market in the 80s and 90s

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
and started to release their personal computers,

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
such as Apple, Commodore, Tandy and so on.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
Nevertheless, this company was able to become a leader only after two years.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
But this company was already a medium-sized company at that time.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
Therefore, if we talk about medium and small companies,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
they will hardly use this strategy.

12:24.000 --> 12:34.000
It requires a lot of money and companies must use the strategy of leadership

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
by reducing costs, but this will not always lead to quality improvement.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Therefore, it is problematic.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
Companies will reduce quality and thus reduce the price due to the reduction of costs,

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
but they may not achieve product leadership.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
The next strategy is a breakthrough or a flank attack.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
It involves the use of a weak side of the leader and finding a gap.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
It can be aimed at a region or a household network,

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
where the dominant company is not represented as well as another company.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
Or it can be aimed at a segment where the product of the leader is not well adapted.

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
The classic strategy is to challenge the market and reduce the price.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
Again, this strategy involves the reduction of the leadership by reducing costs.

13:40.000 --> 13:48.000
This strategy was used by many Japanese companies that entered the US car market.

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
But these companies were not small, they were large enough.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
They entered the market with a basic model.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
We talked about the Ansov matrix.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
These were existing products for the new market.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
They reduced the price for their basic models.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
They took the leading position in relation to American cars,

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
because they were more economical and had better quality.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
They were also sold at a lower price.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
Japanese companies were good at developing their dealerships.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
This allowed the companies to attack the market.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
However, this strategy is not applicable to medium and small companies.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
The third strategy is a circle.

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
This strategy is a gradual accumulation of advantages for the leader by studying his weak points and bypassing competitors from different sides.

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
This strategy is widely used by medium and small companies.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
A good example is the Matryoshka chain of restaurants.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
The direct competitor is the Yelki Palki chain of restaurants.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
The Yelki Palki chain was established earlier than Matryoshka.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
The advantage of this chain was that it was a network of inexpensive restaurants.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
They were called taverns, and they served high-quality home-cooked food at low prices.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
One of the advantages was the Swedish table.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
However, Matryoshka, which was launched in 1996-1997,

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
gradually began to accumulate advantages over the leader.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
What did they do?

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
First, they used the same strategy.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
They followed the leader.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
However, unlike Yelki Palki restaurants, where only one approach to the Swedish table was practiced,

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
Matryoshka started to practice a large number of approaches to the Swedish table.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
They also expanded the range of dishes on the Swedish table.

16:17.000 --> 16:26.000
At almost the same price, a person could have lunch and approach the Swedish table as many times as possible.

16:27.000 --> 16:39.000
This is why Matryoshka used the environment and gradually began to push the Yelki Palki chain of restaurants.

16:39.000 --> 16:49.000
We can see a local example of how Matryoshka pushed the Yelki Palki chain of restaurants.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
There are two restaurants on the Tretikowska metro.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
When Matryoshka restaurants became aggressive enough to enter the market,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Yelki Palki restaurant was forced to close the first floor.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
The first floor was previously taken under the dining room and was re-based under the kitchen.

17:15.000 --> 17:29.000
This is how Matryoshka gradually encircled the competitors and used their weaknesses and advantages.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
The next strategy is to focus on the advantageous areas.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
This is a choice of market segments that attract more competitive attention.

17:39.000 --> 17:47.000
This strategy is used by small companies.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
The next strategy is to avoid competition by releasing non-competitive goods,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
services and services that are not attractive to the competitors of the Sbyt channel.

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
The examples of this strategy are the construction markets, such as the Kashersky Dvor, Strogino and many others,

18:09.000 --> 18:19.000
which sell similar goods to the ABB, Leroy Merlin and others.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
However, they are not competitive at lower prices.

18:25.000 --> 18:34.000
For example, Strogino is quite close to Leroy Merlin.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Each company has its own activity.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Why does this happen?

18:39.000 --> 18:52.000
Strogino sells goods using a completely different channel.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
It does not provide services such as large ABB stores.

19:00.000 --> 19:08.000
It does not use attractive channels of Sbyt.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Its selling points are not attractive.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
However, it has its own customers who are ready to accept such inconveniences

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
and buy goods and construction materials at lower prices.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
We have discussed the strategies that can be attributed to the advantages.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Now we will discuss passive strategies.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
Passive strategies are strategies that involve adaptive behavior.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
Companies decide to coordinate their actions, focusing on the leader.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
They continue to flow.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
They do not go against the flow.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
They coexist peacefully with the leader, because they understand that they will not be able to compete with him.

19:58.000 --> 20:06.000
Passive strategies are more typical of small businesses.

20:06.000 --> 20:16.000
Passive strategies are more typical of small businesses.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
Such a strategy can be used in situations of oligopoly.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Or when companies understand that it is not profitable for them to compete with the leader.

20:27.000 --> 20:38.000
This behavior does not mean that companies cannot have a competitive strategy.

20:38.000 --> 20:48.000
On the contrary, small businesses and the ownership of a small share increase the importance of strategic moments

20:48.000 --> 20:58.000
such as differentiation and giving the advantage to their competitors.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
Small businesses do not necessarily become a dead weight.

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
They simply develop.

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
If you include them in the Boston Consulting matrix,

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
they have their own questions, stars, dogs and cows.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
What can companies do to achieve competitive advantage?

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
First, effective use of OCR or research and development.

21:33.000 --> 21:41.000
In other words, companies should invest a lot of money in research of their segment,

21:41.000 --> 21:50.000
to improve the quality of the product, technology, reduction of costs, etc.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Next, creative segmentation.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
In other words, companies should look for niches and use these advantages.

22:01.000 --> 22:11.000
They should work with small clients and with segments that will not be of interest to large companies.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
They should remain small.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
This can also be an advantage.

22:15.000 --> 22:26.000
Successful small firms can focus their attention on profit, not on sales.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
They will strive for specialization and will not even try to increase their share of the market.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And, of course, strong leadership.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
The influence of the leader is very important.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
Because a strategy is formed, a general strategy is formed,

22:44.000 --> 22:53.000
and the company leadership should give a report on where it wants to lead its company.

22:53.000 --> 23:01.000
I must say that all these parameters are applied to many companies that work in the service sector.

23:01.000 --> 23:14.000
For example, restaurant business, small hotels, companies that sell food, small companies, small stores, sewing, etc.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
They all survive due to these aspects.

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
Passive strategy of following the leader does not imply passive behavior,

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
but rather the care of the leadership about the choice of strategy.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
In this case, the leadership understands the place of the company,

23:34.000 --> 23:42.000
and they develop their strategy and proceed smoothly, without crossing the path of the leader.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Because if they cross the path of the leader, they will be destroyed immediately.

23:46.000 --> 23:53.000
We will consider several strategies that are quite typical for small and medium-sized firms.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
The first is the course of the investigation.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
The company that chooses this passive strategy of following the course

24:00.000 --> 24:08.000
will minimize the risk of the leader's actions, that is, in price policy.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
In other words, the company will not cross paths with the leader in price policy.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It will provide some services or goods at a lower price.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
By the way, the quality of the services or goods provided may not be worse than that of the leader,

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
but it will not cross paths with the leader in this position.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
For example, small car repair companies.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
We have a lot of these companies, car service companies know this.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
They prefer not to compete with official authorized car repair dealers,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
but they provide a very wide range of services.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Of course, there will be both fragmented activity, narrow specialization,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
and a fairly individual approach to the client.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
For example, I can say that many people who have a good car,

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
nevertheless, prefer not to contact authorized dealers,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
who have quite high prices.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Sometimes, if it is not a large enough repair,

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
they prefer to contact their already known car repair masters,

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
because they know that they will serve their cars in a high quality.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
By the way, in this case, the law of experience will work very well here.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
The next strategy is the strategy of preserving the position.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
This passive strategy is aimed at maintaining the consistency in market activity,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
without attracting the attention of competitors.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
But if we look at the previous strategy, we will see that they are very similar.

25:45.000 --> 25:53.000
In this case, if the previous strategy focuses on minimizing the risk of retaliatory actions,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
mainly in price policy,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
then here the company simply maintains the consistency of market activity,

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
and also, what is similar to this strategy, does not attract the attention of competitors.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
What is this activity?

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
Small food and commodity stores, warehouses,

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
they do not want to compete with large and medium-sized companies,

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
not in terms of assortment, not in terms of logistics,

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
but most often they survive due to the fact that they are located near the house,

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
this is a convenient location, offices or stations, let's say,

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
and attract consumers with their price and low prices, and freshness of the product,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
because very often this product is brought every day.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
We have considered the main passive strategies and the prevailing strategies

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
that small and medium-sized companies use.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
But I must say that in addition to this classification,

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
I would like to offer you another classification,

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
a rather interesting one, which represents the four main strategies.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
If you look at this table, we will consider four main strategies.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
The characteristics of the product of a small company and the form of existence of a small company.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
There are four parameters.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
A small company can exist independently of a large company,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
or it is associated with a large company.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
There are also two aspects in terms of the product characteristics.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Is it a product that is similar to a large company's product,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
or is it a completely original product?

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And we see four possibilities here.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
A rather interesting strategy is the false mushroom strategy,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
when a company, regardless of a large company,

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
produces a product similar to a large company's product.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Next is the chameleon,

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
this is a company that produces a product that is similar to a large company's product

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
and is associated with a large company.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
It uses its advantages.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
And two other strategies are the wise pebble strategy,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
when a company produces an original product,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
regardless of a large company.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
Thus, it is abstracted and tries to flow.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And the last strategy is the stinging bee.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
A company produces an original product, but it is associated with a large company.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
This is a strategy of participation in the production of a product.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
We will now look at these strategies in more detail.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
The false mushroom strategy.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Small companies that survive on the market

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
produce so-called fake products.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
Sometimes it happens legally, sometimes it is illegal.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Companies copy the products of large companies using the me-too product strategy.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
If a company uses this strategy and, of course, registers its own product

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
and registers it under a different trademark than the product leader,

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
then this is quite a legal activity.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
This is how many companies work.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
If a company uses the me-too product strategy,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
in other words, it simply uses fake products

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
and uses the power and strength of the product of the company leader,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
then this is illegal.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
Many Chinese products use the false mushroom strategy

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and operate quite illegally on the market.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
We all know, for example, the French BIC pens.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
It is written B-I-C.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
Many companies, unfortunately Chinese companies,

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
copy the products and write B-I-K, B-I-C, B-K, and so on.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
And they produce pens.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
Of course, they also use the strategy of achieving advantages by reducing costs, and so on.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
The false mushroom strategy, however,

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
is independent, as you can see from the table, of other companies.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
But, I must say, if we talk about the legal application of this strategy,

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
it can be applied only in those industries where the main manufacturers invest a lot in NEOCRE,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
or Research and Development,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
and receive at least 15% of the revenue

30:20.000 --> 30:28.000
in relation to the information provided by the communication channels with the public and advertising.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
For example, in this case,

30:32.000 --> 30:40.000
we can see an example of a not very legal use of adidas.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
The company Adomas capitalizes on the name adidas

30:46.000 --> 30:55.000
and can create a little confusion in the consumer's mind, so to speak.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
And people start to confuse the two names and buy the Adomas products.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
I would like to say that this false mushroom strategy,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
if it is used legally,

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
is used by many companies, and by very few companies.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
They follow the leader,

31:16.000 --> 31:23.000
they passively take and use the advantages of the leader's company.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
That is, they take and use all the advantages of the leader

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
and, of course, hunt their consumers because they sell this product at a reduced price.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
If the company uses this strategy quite illegally,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
then it is already an illegal business.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
And I repeat that, unfortunately, many companies in the gray market use this strategy.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
The next strategy is the wise sandpaper strategy.

31:48.000 --> 31:56.000
If you remember, this strategy refers to the fact that this is a company that produces an original product,

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
regardless of the large company.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
When a company uses the wise sandpaper strategy,

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
it produces a completely original product that does not interact with the leader.

32:10.000 --> 32:17.000
This strategy can be compared with the strategies that we have already considered,

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
such as following the course or maintaining a position.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
That is, maintaining a position without attracting the attention of competitors.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
We see here relative connections.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
And with this strategy, the scale effect does not work.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
If a company is engaged in the repair of something,

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
then it works on a limited market.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
For example, if it is the repair of some watches and so on.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
Basically, small companies that follow this strategy,

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
they are engaged in some individual activity

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
or work with a very narrow segment or even with some niche.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
The next strategy is the beef.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
This is a small company that creates an original product,

33:06.000 --> 33:12.000
but unlike the previous strategy, its product is associated with the product of a large company.

33:12.000 --> 33:19.000
This happens when a large company simply gives some small part of the work to a small company,

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
because it is simply not profitable for it to produce this product.

33:22.000 --> 33:30.000
For example, a Toyota company that produces cars, parts, axles, engines, transmissions, driving parts.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
It is simply not profitable for it to produce, for example, accompanying goods, such as covers or mats, and so on.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
And it gives it to other companies for a refund.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
In principle, such large companies can form a vertical marketing system,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
an administered marketing system,

33:50.000 --> 33:58.000
when a tender is announced, and small companies are happy to fight for

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
to work with a large company under its aegis.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Sometimes these are just the same terms of the contract,

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
when a company simply performs a certain activity for a large company,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
and sometimes it turns into long-term cooperation.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
That is, a company can work under the aegis,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
although it has an independent name,

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
it can work with the authorship under the aegis of this large company.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
The next strategy is the Chameleon strategy.

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
The strategy is that a small company creates a product similar to that of a large company,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
but is associated with it by means of franchising.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
If we talked about the first strategy, which is called a false flu,

34:42.000 --> 34:50.000
I will remind you that I told you that in many cases this strategy is used by companies illegally,

34:50.000 --> 34:59.000
but in this case, the company uses completely legal mechanisms.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
A small company becomes a franchisee, in other words, it buys a license from a franchiser

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
and becomes part of this company.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
Again, franchising is one of the forms of vertical marketing systems,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
it is a contractual VMS,

35:16.000 --> 35:23.000
so it is a very fast-growing form of promotion of companies to the new market,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
and it must be said that it is really legal.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
It must be said that 40-60% of the US franchising stores operate in the franchise system.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
In this case, in Russia, franchising is developing very rapidly.

35:37.000 --> 35:44.000
This is due to the fact that legislative documents and a legislative base have appeared,

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
which allowed companies to promote their products through franchising.

35:49.000 --> 35:55.000
I will name such companies as large and small, which operate on the basis of franchising.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
This is Kodak, this is McDonald's, but not in Russia,

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
this is the image of the Persona laboratory, this is franchising.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
If we talk about Russia, then there are companies like Diana,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
they work on franchising.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
In other words, if you want to open your own business,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
you can buy a license from a franchiser, become a franchisee,

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
complete a training course, you are supplied with equipment,

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
and you work under the aegis of this brand,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
that is, you are part of this company,

36:26.000 --> 36:34.000
but thus you definitely calculate some percentage for the franchiser according to the contract.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
This is a very simple and, as I said,

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
very common model now, not only in the United States, but also in Russia.

36:44.000 --> 36:50.000
In addition, as I have already listed, such examples as Diana,

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
I also think of the Coffee House company, which is also a franchising company,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Sweet Mama, which I mentioned,

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
there are a lot of companies that work under the aegis of franchising.

37:05.000 --> 37:13.000
Thus, we have considered the strategies of medium and small firms,

37:14.000 --> 37:21.000
and in this part of the lecture we focused on strategies that can be called

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
preemptive strategies, passive strategies,

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
as well as strategies that are associated with the characteristics of the product

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
and the form of the existence of a small firm.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
False mushroom, wise pebble, chameleon and stingy bee.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
Dear colleagues, our lecture is coming to an end.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
I think this material will be useful to you.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Thank you again for your attention. Thank you. Goodbye.
