00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What are the stages of application for procurement?

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
Let's take a closer look at the stages of application for procurement.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
As I have already noted, one of the first and most important stages is the approval of specifications.

00:18.000 --> 00:30.000
From my personal experience, I can tell you that very often there are situations when the procurement department employee and the internal customer,

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
the person or department that applies for the purchase of a particular material, do not agree with their actions.

00:38.000 --> 00:55.000
As a result, the purchased equipment, goods, and even services do not always meet the expectations of the customer.

00:56.000 --> 01:12.000
Therefore, one of the main priorities in the procurement process is a clear understanding that what the internal customer wants and what the procurement department acquires is the same.

01:12.000 --> 01:26.000
On the other hand, there are very often situations when the internal customer does not know what models of equipment exist on the market,

01:26.000 --> 01:42.000
and the procurement department manager's task is to explain, show the market, show the general picture to the customer,

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
in order to help him make the right choice, write the specification, and so on.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
After the approval of the specifications, the phase of choosing suppliers begins.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
What actions are included in this phase?

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
It is obvious that there is no unique search strategy.

02:08.000 --> 02:20.000
Someone uses a yellow-page magazine, someone searches the Internet, someone has established connections for years, someone uses acquaintances.

02:21.000 --> 02:36.000
This is one of the most difficult and serious phases, because the entire result of the procurement service depends on the supplier.

02:37.000 --> 02:51.000
Here you need to assess not only the financial stability, not only the time the supplier exists and works on the market,

02:51.000 --> 03:04.000
but also assess the future prospects, how long and how seriously this supplier can work with you in the future.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
There is a concept of strategic suppliers.

03:08.000 --> 03:24.000
Often, companies that provide raw materials or very expensive equipment or services are referred to this category of suppliers.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
A strategic supplier can be referred to as an oil refinery and an oil supplier.

03:33.000 --> 03:43.000
In this case, the oil supplier will be a strategic supplier, because the plant has a continuous cycle.

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
It is vital to have stable supplies so that the production cycle does not stop.

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
There are different strategies for finding suppliers for the effective use of the procurement resources.

04:04.000 --> 04:18.000
Some companies that do not compete in one industry unite to strengthen the purchasing power.

04:18.000 --> 04:27.000
By uniting the volumes of purchases, companies claim more favorable supply conditions.

04:27.000 --> 04:42.000
One of the latest examples is the unification of a large and well-known e-commerce network in Russia with a large network in Ukraine.

04:42.000 --> 05:03.000
By uniting their orders, these two companies, without competing in their markets, achieved a 5% discount on the purchase of a certain brand of household electronics.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
We have already discussed prices and supply conditions.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
Now let's talk about price quotas.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
What are price quotas?

05:17.000 --> 05:27.000
Price quotas are offers and conditions that are received from the supplier to the procurement department.

05:28.000 --> 05:37.000
Usually, price quotas describe conditions, supply, place, quantity.

05:37.000 --> 06:00.000
After receiving these documents, the company employees, not only the procurement department employees, but also the internal customers, have a difficult task to determine the fair price of the purchase.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
I would like to note that very often the lowest price is understood as the best.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
But from experience, I would say that this is not always the case.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
You need to look at the overall factors and what the company gets in the end, having paid a certain price.

06:20.000 --> 06:30.000
The so-called cost of the product and what value this product, purchased at a certain price, will bring to the company.

06:30.000 --> 06:40.000
Therefore, the factors that are taken into account when making a decision are, of course, the price, quality, and supply conditions.

06:40.000 --> 06:51.000
The possibility of constant and timely, uninterrupted delivery.

06:51.000 --> 07:06.000
And one very important factor is the service, after-sale service, the overall level of cooperation, the exchange of documents, the exchange of information.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
These conditions are the basis for making a decision.

07:15.000 --> 07:26.000
To adopt a strategy for purchasing, the procurement department manager must take all the above factors as a guide to action.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
After a potential supplier is determined, the phase of receiving the product to the warehouse comes.

07:33.000 --> 07:41.000
It is certainly very important where and in what condition the product you have purchased will end up.

07:41.000 --> 07:49.000
The specialist in receiving the product to the warehouse, in our understanding, is often called a storekeeper,

07:49.000 --> 07:59.000
must notify the procurement service about the product received, what application the product was accepted for,

07:59.000 --> 08:12.000
whether the quantity, quality, packaging, marking, additional conditions correspond to those that were declared by the internal client or internal customer.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
As soon as the procurement manager receives information about the availability of the product, the payment phase for the received product begins.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
The payment phase for the received product is called the pre-payment phase.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
The role of the procurement service specialist is to monitor the timely payment,

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
since we are responsible to the supplier for the fulfillment of our obligations.

08:41.000 --> 08:53.000
Summing up the work of the procurement department, it should be noted that in fact it is one of the most specific,

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
one of the most complex functions that are included in the entire delivery system.

09:00.000 --> 09:12.000
It is no secret that this is the department where there are abuse, violations of corporate ethics, violations of business ethics.

09:12.000 --> 09:21.000
Therefore, one of the key tasks, and I would say the most important task, is to select the personnel,

09:22.000 --> 09:31.000
to select the personnel for the delivery system in general and specifically for the procurement department.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Inbound logistics.

09:35.000 --> 09:46.000
Traditionally, inbound logistics is associated with the process of purchasing and delivering materials to the warehouse.

09:46.000 --> 09:57.000
Obtaining and storing raw materials is the first and main part of the entire logistics process.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
Some researchers consider the inbound logistics to be a fairly limited function,

10:03.000 --> 10:12.000
which includes elements such as purchasing and transporting goods to the warehouse.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
I would like to note the difference between inbound and outbound logistics.

10:19.000 --> 10:28.000
Since outbound logistics is a subject of its activity,

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
the inbound logistics mainly works with raw materials,

10:33.000 --> 10:46.000
and the main difference between the types of raw materials and the various approaches to management of both inbound and outbound logistics is that

10:46.000 --> 10:58.000
the first difference is the market demand, which affects the outbound logistics.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
Specifically, the client dictates, if one can say so, dictates,

11:04.000 --> 11:12.000
he makes his requirements to the organization for packaging, for the completion of the finished product,

11:12.000 --> 11:26.000
while the inbound logistics operates with the material or raw material that does not require such a careful approach to the selection of the equipment as the outbound logistics require.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
The second difference is the very essence of the transported goods.

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
The material specialist who is part of the purchasing service in the inbound logistics phase

11:40.000 --> 11:48.000
works mainly with large masses of raw materials and components.

11:48.000 --> 12:00.000
In addition, the raw materials have other requirements for transportation, storage, than the finished product,

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
which significantly affects the choice of type of transportation and carrier.

12:06.000 --> 12:15.000
I believe that the most significant difference is that for the warehouse worker,

12:15.000 --> 12:29.000
the work is facilitated by the fact that the raw materials and their quality are discussed much earlier,

12:30.000 --> 12:39.000
both by the customer and the purchasing department, in order to ensure the incoming quality,

12:39.000 --> 12:50.000
while the warehouse worker of the finished product should pay great attention to the safety and completeness of the finished product.

12:51.000 --> 13:00.000
The decision on the type of transportation of the finished product and its cost is the competence of the loading managers.

13:00.000 --> 13:10.000
In fact, both the inbound and the outbound logistics have two common elements â€“ storage and transportation.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Let's talk in a nutshell about the storage process.

13:14.000 --> 13:28.000
The goal and the tasks of this function are storage, sorting and timely delivery of raw materials and finished products.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
Storage is an integral part of the delivery system.

13:34.000 --> 13:41.000
The main goals of the storage and storage process are reducing the costs of transportation,

13:41.000 --> 13:52.000
the possibility of product combination, improving the service level and the continuity of the production cycle.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
The main operations of the storage of raw materials and finished products can be illustrated as follows.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
The main tasks of the storage and storage process are receiving and checking the compliance,

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
unpacking, re-packing, dividing into parts, combining and making the production mix,

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
moving to the storage area, checking the quantity, writing off the defective raw material,

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
and the final delivery of the finished product.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
The main tasks of the storage and storage process are the use of the storage area and the volume of the storage,

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
the use of machines and mechanisms for moving the finished product,

14:41.000 --> 14:49.000
the creation and application of storage plans, the absence of so-called unoccupied islands in the area of the storage area,

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
the availability of appropriate storage conditions, ventilation, access roads.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
In conclusion, I would like to note the importance and role of planning the management of the warehouse economy.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
When making a decision on the management strategy of the warehouse economy,

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
it is necessary to take into account such factors as the form of ownership of the warehouse,

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
the number of warehouses, the territory, the size, the availability of warehouse equipment.

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
When talking about improving the operation of the warehouse, such criteria are usually taken into account.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
Reducing the distance between the loading and unloading points,

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
increasing the number of raw materials or materials loaded into one movement,

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
double-sided loading of warehouse equipment and the use of technologies.

15:50.000 --> 16:01.000
You know that many companies have switched to the use of software or high-tech for efficient storage operation.

16:01.000 --> 16:09.000
Among them, such as barcoding, automatic loading and unloading,

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
the use of software and high-tech for efficient storage operation.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
When talking about the logistics, it is necessary to mention transport.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
What is transport?

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
When transporting raw materials and finished products,

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
it is usually meant to move goods from one point to another geographically.

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
This is the element that constitutes the delivery system as one of the most capital-intensive.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
The importance of this function is evidenced by the fact that almost at every enterprise

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
there is a position or a person who is responsible for the transport.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
In the context of the procurement service or the delivery system,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
regardless of how the transport is used,

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
either it is a third-party company providing services,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
or there is its own transport department or site,

17:12.000 --> 17:21.000
there is always a person or a function that controls the transportation of materials from one point to another.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
The transportation of materials is a service,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
but regardless of the fact that it is a service,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
the acquisition of this service is comparable to the acquisition of materials.

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
One of the aspects of transportation is, in essence, a service for moving goods.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
This aspect includes the main indicators,

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
speed, reliability and frequency of movement and delivery of this service.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
The next important factor is the type of transport.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
Traditionally, five types of transport are distinguished.

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
1. Pipe transport. It is used for liquid and gas-like products, such as oil, gas, water.

18:09.000 --> 18:17.000
2. Air transport. In theory, any type of product can be transported by air,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
but there are certain restrictions.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
These are in terms of quantity, weight, size.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
Accordingly, air transport is one of the most expensive, if not the most expensive.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
3. Water transport.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
Its significant difference is that it also allows you to transport almost any material.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
It allows you to transport large-sized materials,

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
but there are restrictions due to low speed and geographical restrictions,

18:51.000 --> 18:58.000
since not every point has access to a sea or river port.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
4. Railway transport. Along with car transport, it is one of the most used.

19:04.000 --> 19:13.000
It allows you to transport large volumes of goods, large dimensions, high delivery speed,

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
but there are also restrictions on the location,

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
since there are not railway routes and terminals laid everywhere.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
Railway transport is often combined with other types of transport.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
5. Automobile transport. Automobile transport is one of the most popular and often used.

19:34.000 --> 19:46.000
Because the roads are laid on a large area, this type of transport is used most often.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
It allows you to transport both small and large volumes of goods,

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
but at the same time there are restrictions on the use of this type of transport,

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
due to the fact that there are restrictions on dimensions,

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
and, especially due to the growing prices for energy carriers,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
the cost of this type of transport is significantly increased.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
It is obvious that depending on the type of transport, the type of transport is chosen.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
Very often, when moving goods from one point to another,

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
the price factor affects the process of choosing the type of transport.

20:30.000 --> 20:41.000
In this regard, the costs of transportation take up a significant place in the cost of the goods delivered to the enterprise.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
Along with other additional costs for loading and unloading,

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
the price of the goods includes the cost set by the transport company.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
The price factor can include loading and unloading,

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
packing requirements, special services,

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
for example, when transporting fuel lubricants,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
for example, when transporting lubricants,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
for example, when transporting lubricants,

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
refrigeration transportation, and so on.

21:18.000 --> 21:26.000
However, the transportation should not be considered only as a geographical movement of goods from one point to another.

21:26.000 --> 21:34.000
Traditionally, the most frequently used approach is to provide services in a complex way.

21:34.000 --> 21:41.000
As I said, this includes loading, unloading, and storage in the warehouse.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
Thus, the main task of the managers of the delivery systems

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
is to select and combine the types of transport

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
to transport the necessary goods in the most profitable way.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
For example, if we order a computer in China,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
and at the same time we are in Moscow,

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
it is obvious that the most expensive means of delivery will be air transportation.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Therefore, combined transport is used,

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
for example, to the port in the Black Sea or the Baltic Sea,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
and then it is transported by sea,

22:26.000 --> 22:34.000
and then it is delivered by rail to the distributor center near Moscow,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
and from the distributor center or from the warehouse,

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
it is transported by car to the supplier.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
There are three ways to solve the issue of transportation.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
The first is to create your own transport park.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
For example, the Gazprom gas transportation system,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
when the pipeline system belongs to this company.

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
It gets raw materials and delivers them to the suppliers through its gas transportation system.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Let's take the example of Coca-Cola.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
All the cars that you can often see on the roads of the country

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
are owned by Coca-Cola.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
Contractual relations with transport companies.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
You know about the existence of a large number of car companies

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
that provide services for transportation.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Sea, air carriers.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
And there are companies, so-called multi-modular companies,

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
which provide their services in a complex.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
That is, having signed a contract with such a company,

23:43.000 --> 23:51.000
you are completely dependent on their experience and expertise in the delivery of goods.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Such companies are Mayrsk, DHL, for example.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
To sum up,

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
regardless of the chosen delivery strategy,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
the complexity, the territory, the alternatives,

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
three factors remain decisive when choosing a transport.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
These are cost, speed, reliability or uninterruptibility of deliveries.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
On the table you will see comparative characteristics,

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
indicators of the efficiency of transport operation according to different criteria.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
It is clear that the general assessment is the least acceptable.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
This is still a water transport.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Due to the fact that the delivery speed is low,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
technical capabilities are quite limited,

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
the risks of delivery, which provide reliability of delivery, are quite high.

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
However, the cost of transportation by water transport,

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
compared to other types of transport, is quite low.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
Looking at the general assessment, we can see that car transport,

25:11.000 --> 25:19.000
as it is in real life, is the most affordable and convenient

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
in terms of price, cost and uninterruptibility of deliveries.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Production and operational strategy.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
The issue of production organization is quite complex.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Traditional operational management of enterprises

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
is associated with the production of a particular product.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
However, in fact, the same principles apply to any type of business,

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
from production to service.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
The decision on how to produce a product or service

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
is formed by your operational strategy.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
What will you choose?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Production in-stock, production on order,

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
specific production development, or a combination of these options?

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Maybe you will use the services of a third-party organization

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
to produce your main product?

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
Maybe you will choose production in another country

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
with subsequent delivery to your warehouse?

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Where will a particular product be produced?

26:28.000 --> 26:36.000
Where will the initial and final phase of production cycle be?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
The solution to these issues is critical

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
due to their impact on the final cost of the finished product.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
It forms the entire system structure,

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
and its purpose is to support the production cycle,

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
regardless of whether it is a bank, a transport company,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
a production company or a producer.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Your production and operational strategy

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
directly affects the function and strategy of the delivery system.

27:13.000 --> 27:20.000
Let's talk about the above-mentioned production strategies.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
One of the most common is production in-stock.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
This strategy is used for products

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
with a low level of variety of designs and forms.

27:36.000 --> 27:43.000
It is best suited for standard products produced in large volumes.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
The larger the volume of the produced batches,

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
the lower the cost of the final product.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
The advantage of this system is that,

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
by producing a product and storing it in a warehouse,

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
the speed of response to customer requests increases.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
If you receive an order for a particular type of product,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
you can immediately unload it.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Production in-stock.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
This strategy is preferred for products

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
produced in standard design and form,

28:19.000 --> 28:26.000
but with the purpose of satisfying specific customer requirements.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
The following strategies are used by companies

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
that produce products only when the customer has an order.

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
This allows them to maintain a low level of stock of finished products

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
and goods and to produce a wide range of products at the same time.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
A typical example of this strategy is car production.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
The way companies sell and produce cars

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
is that at a certain time,

29:03.000 --> 29:10.000
the car distributor sends an order to the factory,

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
where the car brands are written,

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
their configuration, up to the color and so on.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
The factory manufacturer, having received this order,

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
already forms its production cycle and production schedule.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
Thus, exactly the number of cars that were ordered is unloaded,

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
and the unsold cars are not accumulated in the warehouse.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Ordering.

29:44.000 --> 29:51.000
Ordering is a mixed strategy that allows you to produce a series of products,

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
but the final preparation and adjustment

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
is done for each customer separately upon receiving the order.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
This strategy is usually used for those types of products

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
when a wide range is produced,

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
but companies need to maintain low warehouse reserves.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
An example is the production of souvenir products

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
or products with the customer's logo.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
When planning an advertising campaign,

30:25.000 --> 30:33.000
the company may want to put the logo of its organization on a standard pen.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
In this case, the factory manufacturer can store the pens of a standard type,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
a standard shape in its warehouse,

30:40.000 --> 30:48.000
but put the logo of a specific customer who orders this type of service.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And work on the order.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
Usually, this strategy is used by companies

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
that produce unique or high-tech equipment,

31:00.000 --> 31:09.000
which is designed and specially designed for a specific order.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
This can be aerospace products,

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
or specific equipment for scientific and research activities, and so on.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
In the table, you can see a diagram of how the changes in your production strategy

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
affect the delivery system strategy and model.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
And how the delivery system becomes a source of competitive advantage.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
In the warehouse production strategy,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
you get a low production cost

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
in conjunction with a rapid response to customer requests.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Production on order gives you the opportunity to customize

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
and a low level of reserves increases the level of service.

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
Assembling on order also allows you to keep a low level of reserves

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
and reduce it to zero,

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
but along with a wide range and a choice of produced products,

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
in turn, it makes it easier to plan.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
And finally, development on order allows you to meet specific requirements.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
In the slide, you can see the division of production strategies by industry.

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
It is obvious that high-tech products, telecommunications and electronics

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
have a mixed strategy for production.

32:37.000 --> 32:45.000
While products of wide consumption, packaged products,

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
are mainly produced on order and then unloaded.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
In conclusion, I would like to say that no matter what the production strategy of the enterprise is,

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
it is quite obvious that the delivery management system

33:00.000 --> 33:05.000
should be tied and regulated in such a way

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
to satisfy the customer's needs as much as possible

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
and meet the production requirements.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
The outcome of logistics or distribution of finished products

33:16.000 --> 33:23.000
is usually called the development of efficient channels of distribution of finished products to consumers.

33:23.000 --> 33:33.000
The purpose of this system is to satisfy the customer's needs in the finished product in the best way.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Historically, in many companies, both before and still,

33:36.000 --> 33:43.000
the function of outgoing logistics was associated partially with the work and functioning of the marketing department.

33:43.000 --> 33:52.000
In this section, we will consider the main characteristics and principles of the function of outgoing logistics.

33:52.000 --> 34:00.000
As we have already considered, the main task of distribution is the rule 7N.

34:00.000 --> 34:07.000
The necessary product in the necessary quality should be delivered to the necessary place

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
to the necessary customer at the necessary price.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
It will be useful to consider this rule in detail.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
Let's consider the example of the production of a package with apple juice.

34:22.000 --> 34:29.000
The necessary quality of the product means that the right transport,

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
the right packaging for transportation, and the right price were chosen.

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
The right price means that the right type of raw material, the right supplier, the right type of transport,

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
the right time and place of delivery of the product to the production site,

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
and the factor that the supplier provided the optimal delivery cost.

34:52.000 --> 35:01.000
Each of the seven elements shows what it can mean in the context of information,

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
transportation, packaging, service, and management control.

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
Many companies have several channels for distributing the finished product.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
The diagram below illustrates the possible distribution channels.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
Let's describe these channels in our example of apple juice production.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
The package with juice is delivered to the wholesale trading company from the manufacturer.

35:30.000 --> 35:36.000
Then the transport company delivers it to the distribution warehouses,

35:36.000 --> 35:45.000
from which restaurants, hotels, cafes, and supermarkets deliver the package to the final consumer.

35:45.000 --> 35:54.000
Simply put, the distribution channel is the path that the product goes from the manufacturer to the final consumer.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Some distribution channels are simple.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
For example, the trading company buys an apple from a farmer and sells it to the consumer.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Others are complicated.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
The same example, but the trading company buys an apple from a wholesale seller,

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
who buys the product from the manufacturer.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
Then the product is sold not to the final consumer, but to the intermediaries in the delivery system,

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
such as hotels, cafes, bars, and restaurants.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
The danger that lies in the management of the distribution system

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
is the loss of communication between the supplier and the consumer.

36:38.000 --> 36:45.000
This can be avoided by building a vertical marketing system,

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
in which all parties are interested in working to achieve the same goal.

36:52.000 --> 37:00.000
It should be noted that many companies consider the incoming and outgoing logistics to be different disciplines.

37:00.000 --> 37:07.000
Buyers and managers of distribution centers pay all their attention to the level of service.

37:07.000 --> 37:15.000
Supply and distribution specialists ensure that there are no residuals.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
Organizational structures do not see the whole picture of the business due to the lack of common information systems.

37:23.000 --> 37:30.000
Moving in the direction of creating product value,

37:30.000 --> 37:40.000
it should be noted that in the delivery system, which is designed to achieve the best result,

37:40.000 --> 37:49.000
the entire chain from the supplier to the buyer is monitored and controlled by everyone,

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
without exception, including the members of this chain.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
Thus, the correct structure of the management of the delivery system allows you to control the entire system

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
from the manufacturer to the buyer from start to finish.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
The advantages of combining the work of two systems,

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
including the incoming and outgoing logistics,

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
are transparency and 100% control of the entire supply chain,

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
management of orders, downloads and deliveries in a single interface,

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
and the determination of new opportunities for transportation,

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
including on-the-go loads, delivery strategy, and so on.

38:34.000 --> 38:42.000
It is also necessary to remember the distribution requirement planning strategy,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
which is applicable in this case.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
Planning of distribution requirements, which is used to plan distribution channels,

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
allows not only to coordinate the work of all systems,

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
but also to synchronize the needs of the customer and the production capabilities.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
Thus, the main goal of creating effective distribution channels

39:08.000 --> 39:15.000
is to achieve the tasks set by close cooperation between the supplier and the consumer.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
The rapid development of the global economy in the 1980s and 1990s,

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
in parallel with the growth of the application of computers and computer technologies

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
in solving supply issues,

39:27.000 --> 39:36.000
led to a rapid growth of opportunities for data and document exchange between suppliers and manufacturers.

39:37.000 --> 39:44.000
This allowed both the buyer and the supplier to provide information to each other

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
much more timely and accurately,

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
while increasing the efficiency of work and reducing the bureaucratic burden,

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
as well as increasing the quality of decisions made.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
In turn, the need for innovation and flexibility prompted many companies

40:03.000 --> 40:14.000
to introduce data exchange systems and thus change the existing organizational structure

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
to reduce production costs.

40:18.000 --> 40:26.000
The idea is that a successful organization has the ability to generate and transmit the necessary knowledge

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
and information both within the company and outside it.

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
Often, the term data exchange is associated primarily with electronic information systems.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
This is not a coincidence, as in the modern world the necessary information

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
obtained in the right time is the main asset of the company.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
The dynamics of the growth of companies in the world,

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
which use information technologies very highly,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
can be seen in the table.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
The number of companies using data exchange systems is growing.

41:05.000 --> 41:11.000
In this section, we will consider some aspects of modern data transfer systems

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
that are used to efficiently manage the supply system.

41:15.000 --> 41:23.000
Electronic data exchange is a process of transferring information

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
and formal business transactions in a standard format between organizations.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It has four forms.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
1. Transmission of electronic funds, banks, calculations with suppliers at the point of sale.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
2. Transmission of trading data, order for delivery,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
3. Downloading of data from the account.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
4. Transmission of technical data, drawings, graphics, interactive database.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
In our country, the rapid growth of electronic data exchange

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
was caused by the growth of retail trading networks.

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
As in the rest of the world, the use of barcoding as an element of electronic data exchange

42:04.000 --> 42:11.000
significantly accelerates the process of obtaining information within the supply system.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
You have probably seen and can imagine what barcoding is.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
These are parallel lines applied to the packaging or directly to the product.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
These parallel lines are read by a scanner,

42:27.000 --> 42:34.000
and the data encoded in this code is transmitted to the central computer.

42:34.000 --> 42:41.000
The scheme of operation of the barcoding system is quite simple.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
Let's take the example of the production of a package with apple juice.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
When the product arrives at the warehouse of the finished product,

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
a barcode is applied to it.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
This barcode is read by a scanner,

42:56.000 --> 43:02.000
and the information about the packaging, the quantity of units of the product in the packaging,

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
is sent to the main computer of the manufacturer.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
Then the manufacturer transfers this data to its supplier.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
After the physical product has arrived at the supplier's warehouse,

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
the supplier is responsible for receiving the product.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
The scanner reads this information, and the information is sent to the supplier's computer.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
When the product is sold,

43:26.000 --> 43:32.000
for example, when you buy a particular product in a supermarket cashier,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
you see that the scanner reads the information.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
After the data is read and the payment is made,

43:38.000 --> 43:44.000
the information about the payment is sent to the supermarket's warehouse,

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
and automatically to the supplier's warehouse.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
The supplier knows that the product has been sold,

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
and a new order for delivery is automatically generated.

43:56.000 --> 44:04.000
There are several reasons for the increase in the use of electronic data exchange systems.

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
The use of electronic data exchange systems becomes a standard practice in all companies,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
especially in the production sector.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
The desire to reduce the production cycle

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
supports the use of electronic data exchange systems.

44:19.000 --> 44:24.000
The desire to reduce the production cycle

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
supports the use of electronic data exchange systems.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
These systems also allow to create a higher additional cost

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
and to free up human, financial and temporary resources

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
that were previously involved in the process of data exchange.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
As mentioned above,

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
the main focus of the delivery systems managers

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
is on the process of data exchange.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
This is due to the ability to respond quickly to customer requests

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
and to information about deliveries.

45:00.000 --> 45:10.000
These systems are called ERP, Enterprise Resource Planning,

45:10.000 --> 45:16.000
which is a system of resource planning.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
The delivery systems are characterized by the following functions.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
The management of stocks,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
purchase,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
product configurator,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
delivery system planning,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
production forecasting,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
quality control,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
processing of claims,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
calculation of commission discounts.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
The system of data storage about suppliers and buyers,

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
the so-called general corporate memory of the enterprise,

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
is often used by many employees of the procurement department

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
as a database for choosing suppliers of a particular product

46:00.000 --> 46:06.000
in order to reduce the time for searching and increase the efficiency of their work.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
In conclusion,

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
in order to understand the importance of the resource planning system

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
for managing the delivery system,

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
it is important to understand and characterize the main tasks

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
that are set by the procurement system managers.

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
One of the main tasks is to reduce the bureaucratic waste,

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
which allows to release human resources.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
Reducing the workforce required for processing information

46:31.000 --> 46:38.000
allows to reduce the time required for processing from 15 to 40%.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
Accelerating the development of the integrated supply and raw material management system

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
allows to manage the raw material supplies of the buyer.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
The third party trading network is used.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
At the same time, the intensity of the interaction between the buyer and the department

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
that consumes raw material and suppliers increases.

46:59.000 --> 47:05.000
Electronic data exchange also helps to significantly reduce the total overhead costs.

47:05.000 --> 47:11.000
Some advantages of the introduction of electronic data exchange are given below.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
Electronic payment systems,

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
purchasing without the use of paper carriers,

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
professionalism in purchasing,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
growth of productivity,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
reduction of the level of stocks,

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
reduction of the time for processing orders,

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
creating an improved connection with suppliers and consumers,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
obtaining reliable and fast information,

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
increased accuracy of data,

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
support of the barcoding system.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
However, along with the advantages,

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
it is necessary to note the significant difficulties that arise before companies

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
in the process of introducing electronic data exchange systems.

47:53.000 --> 48:00.000
Some companies make decisions about gradual automation of processes,

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
other companies start a business right away

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
and at the very beginning introduce automated accounting and management systems.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
The difficulties are the following.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
The cost of software.

48:17.000 --> 48:24.000
Very often companies face this difficulty because they do not see the whole picture

48:24.000 --> 48:32.000
and buy a small module that can cover or solve the problem of a separate site,

48:32.000 --> 48:38.000
but does not solve the problem of the whole system or the whole organization.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
The next problem is the cost of the program.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
This includes the services of consultants,

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
training of staff,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
modernization of equipment,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
purchase of new equipment,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
reorganization of existing workplaces,

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
laying of networks, communications and so on.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
One of the difficulties of non-material nature

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
can be attributed to the resistance of existing staff to new introductions.

49:08.000 --> 49:13.000
So, people who are used to working with the old system,

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
can resist the introduction of new processes,

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
especially if it is related to the dismissal of staff

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
or the reorganization of the company as a whole.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
The reorganization of business processes of the enterprise,

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
both separate and the whole company as a whole.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
And the last, but one of the most significant problems

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
is the coordination of certain functions of the system

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
between all departments, between all elements of the company.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
Each user of the same information should receive it on time

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
and should receive exactly what is necessary.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I will give an example.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
At the time of sale of a unit of finished product,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
the financial department, the procurement department, the sales department,

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
each should see in their own way,

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
from their side, this element, this operation.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
That is, for the financial department,

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
the implementation of the product took place and money should be received.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
For the sales department, it is a disbursement.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
For the supply department, it is a command to purchase raw materials

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
for the production of a new unit of product.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
As you can see from the above,

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
the process of managing electronic data exchange systems

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
is quite attractive from the point of view of enterprise management.

50:44.000 --> 50:50.000
But, in turn, it is very difficult from the point of view of the implementation

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
of this system for production and its launch.

50:55.000 --> 51:00.000
Nevertheless, the main goal that the company pursues

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
by implementing an electronic data exchange system

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
is quality and timely service of the customer.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
All of the above allows us to understand how the system works,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
what its main components are,

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
how effective this system works,

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
how effective the operation of one or another element is.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Do you know how it works?

51:24.000 --> 51:32.000
If not, you risk losing the relationship between the supplier and the customer,

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
reducing the company's cost and actually losing control over the costs.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
The lack of information on how your supply system works

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
and how effectively it works is particularly dangerous for those activities

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
where the supply system is the basis of business operation.

51:53.000 --> 51:58.000
This includes production, retail and wholesale companies.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
The danger is so great that mistakes and lack of information

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
can lead to bankruptcy of the company.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
There is a saying,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
if you cannot measure, you cannot correct.

52:10.000 --> 52:16.000
Very rarely there are programs that would allow to measure

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
the work and efficiency of the system and the supply in general,

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
that would help to show the whole picture of the system.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
They would be quite clear and simple

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
and would point to the source of the problem in the system.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
The reason is simple.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
Creating a strong, effective and understandable supply system

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
is a very complex process in itself.

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
Even the process of matching the indicators of efficiency measurement

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
between different departments, between the financial,

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
between the production and the supply departments

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
is a complex process in itself.

53:02.000 --> 53:10.000
Moreover, automating it makes it even more complicated.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
The main problem is the matching of the criteria.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
The indicator of efficiency for the financial department,

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
what the financial department does,

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
is not always the same as the sales department.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
And the fact that the sales department is not always

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
a sufficient or correct criterion for the assessment of the production.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
I suggest you think about the criteria for the assessment of the work

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
that is used at your enterprise.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
Surely, in many companies there are surveys

53:47.000 --> 53:53.000
for the assessment of the level of work of the sales department,

53:53.000 --> 53:59.000
the assessment of the level of work of the suppliers,

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
how they interact with each other.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Unfortunately, in most organizations,

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
they pay attention only to the financial indicators of the system.

54:12.000 --> 54:17.000
This is not surprising, because the financial reports

54:17.000 --> 54:24.000
and financial indicators are indicators of the work of the entire company as a whole.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
But the assessment of the work of the supply system

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
should not be limited to digital values,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
only financial indicators.

54:38.000 --> 54:45.000
Financial indicators do not reflect the picture at this particular time,

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
or they speak about the picture, about the results of the work already done.

54:50.000 --> 54:56.000
But financial indicators cannot reflect the efficiency of the system in the future.

54:56.000 --> 55:04.000
Moreover, for example, for companies whose shares are traded

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
on the New York stock exchange,

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
after a series of corporate scandals in the late 1990s,

55:11.000 --> 55:20.000
standards were introduced, which must be implemented in all companies

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
whose shares are traded on the stock exchange.

55:23.000 --> 55:29.000
This document is called the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
The document describes the main requirements for accounting,

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
spending, fairness of financial reporting as a whole.

55:38.000 --> 55:47.000
A lot of attention is paid to the implementation and administration of documentation,

55:47.000 --> 55:53.000
control, procedures and figures obtained.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
Therefore, the main requirement of this Act

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
is the correct and effective construction of control procedures in the company.

56:00.000 --> 56:07.000
But if the financial indicators of the system can help determine

56:07.000 --> 56:13.000
the degree of influence of the supply system on the financial state of the company,

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
then I believe that these criteria may not be applicable

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
to measure the performance of the system as a whole.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
The answer lies on the surface.

56:24.000 --> 56:31.000
The financial indicators represent the performance of the company in the past

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
and do not give an opportunity to see the future.

56:34.000 --> 56:40.000
Also, the financial indicators do not provide us with non-financial information,

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
such as the level of service, customer service,

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
or the quality of the order for delivery.

56:49.000 --> 56:55.000
Is it really so important to measure the performance of the system and delivery?

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Of course.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
Especially for novice companies, it is very important to understand

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
and determine at the initial stage what criteria,

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
what assessments will be used to measure the efficiency of the enterprise,

57:12.000 --> 57:19.000
and to identify the problem in time and react to it in time.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
As we have already said, the delivery system consists of five components.

57:24.000 --> 57:30.000
These are planning, search, production, purchase and storage.

57:30.000 --> 57:37.000
Identifying the criteria for assessing the efficiency of work in each of these elements

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
will help us to determine which element requires improvement

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
and will help us to correctly identify the problem.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
In turn, the process of measuring the indicators of the system's operation,

57:50.000 --> 57:55.000
also called KPI,

57:55.000 --> 58:03.000
helps the delivery system workers to clearly understand what the management expects from them

58:03.000 --> 58:09.000
and becomes a tool that allows them to measure the process over time.

58:09.000 --> 58:14.000
It is very difficult to determine the indicators of the delivery system's operation.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
It is even more difficult to measure them.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
The table shows the main indicators and their definition.

58:22.000 --> 58:29.000
The reliability of deliveries can be described by the efficiency of delivery,

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
the number of orders, the quality of delivery.

58:33.000 --> 58:42.000
By the way the company processes orders, we can see the efficiency of the system,

58:42.000 --> 58:49.000
the correctness of the selection of the place, time, quality, quantity of processing of documentation.

58:49.000 --> 58:57.000
The ability to respond quickly to the customer's needs is characterized by the time of the order.

58:57.000 --> 59:05.000
The speed at which the delivery chain helps to produce a product

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
and deliver it from the manufacturer to the end consumer.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Flexibility.

59:11.000 --> 59:19.000
Flexibility can be measured by the time the delivery system responds to the consumer's requirements.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Flexibility of production.

59:22.000 --> 59:29.000
The ability of the delivery system to adapt and respond quickly to the changing market demands,

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
to the changing customer's demands.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Costs.

59:33.000 --> 59:42.000
The cost is a classic example that can be attributed to the financial indicators of the system's operation.

59:42.000 --> 59:48.000
The cost of production, the cost of the delivery system,

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
the productivity, the guarantee of return on investment,

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
and the efficiency of asset management.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:02.000
The efficiency of asset management is measured by the time of the money-money cycle,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
that is, from the moment of payment of raw materials to the moment of payment of money for the finished product.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Of course, at the highest level, expectations of efficient management of the delivery system are associated with financial indicators.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.000
However, the indicators of the measurement of the delivery system have three main goals.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
First, they must translate financial indicators and tasks into operational ones.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
You translate quantitative indicators into plans and budgets.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
If, for example, the primary task is to reduce the cost of distribution,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:48.000
then there are changes made in the budget to establish specific goals for reducing costs.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:58.000
This can be changing the type of transportation, changing the type of warehouse for storing finished products, changing the place.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Second, you must translate operational achievements into more predictable forecasts of future sales and revenues.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.000
You set specific individual and collective goals that are related to the overall strategy of the company.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
For example, if you plan to stimulate the reduction of costs for delivery,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:29.000
the goal of distribution centers will be to reduce the percentage of urgent orders or urgent deliveries, respectively, more expensive, compared to standard ones.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:38.000
In order to track changes in the process, you can measure the percentage or level of implementation of new initiatives,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
which allows you to reduce high delivery tariffs.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:57.000
For example, the desire to receive goods in the off-work time, on the day off, when the tariffs are significantly lower than when the company strives to receive the delivery during the working day.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Third, you must set the tone of work of the entire team of people working in the delivery management system, which supports the strategy of the entire business.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Thus, the measurement of the efficiency of the delivery management system allows you to determine how the overall work of the system is improving or deteriorating, and what actions are necessary to change the situation.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:50.000
In order to make the measures of efficiency of the company's work regular, your company must first of all decide on the approach to efficiency measurement.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:05.000
During my entire work, I came to the conclusion that for the quality measurement of the efficiency of the system, the indicators should have such characteristics

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:20.000
They should be balanced and understandable. They should be in line with the general business strategy of the company. The goals should be taken into account by the internal and external standards of the company.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:31.000
They should be ambitious, but achievable. At all levels of the company, there is an opportunity to track and control the assessment criteria.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The assessment criteria are used as a tool for the constant improvement of the efficiency of the system.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:04:05.000
The process of measuring efficiency is implemented through a formal plan. For example, the leading manufacturer of personal computers has developed a business strategy based on low production costs, constant innovation and a production scheme for a warehouse for quick response to customer orders.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Each production unit should produce products with the lowest costs, have ready-made products for shipment to the warehouse, and within 2-3 days after receiving the order.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:30.000
In this case, the criteria for measuring the efficiency of the system will be the cost of production, the efficiency of delivery and the speed of order execution.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Since the main criteria for assessing the work are financial indicators, I would like to draw the attention of listeners to the financial indicators and financial characteristics of costs.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:56.000
The control over these costs is a criterion for the efficiency of the delivery system within the framework of the entire enterprise.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Since the main indicators of the delivery system are financial results, I would like to draw the attention of listeners to the costs and their types, which are usually associated with the management of the delivery system as a whole.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:22.000
The control over these costs and the desire to reduce them is a criterion for assessing the work of the supply department as a part of the enterprise.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The table shows the types of costs.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:34.000
The types of costs can be attributed to the management of orders, such as the costs of launching a new product, designing and developing a new product,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:55.000
the actual creation of the order of the supplier, the management of contracts, the implementation of them, the storage, the planning of the installation, the distribution, the transportation, the freight, the duties, and the administration of the issuance of accounts and the accounting of orders.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
The acquisition of materials.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:15.000
The acquisition of materials is associated with the costs of managing and planning the raw materials, technical management of the quality of the suppliers, obtaining and storing of raw materials,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
the control of the quality during the acceptance, the storage of supplies.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:37.000
The costs associated with this are the costs incurred during the writing-off of the marriage, insurance, taxes, the general aging of supplies, the writing-off of the warehouse from production, the unfinished production and the finished product.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Finances and planning.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:07:01.000
The financial costs associated with the functioning of the supply system, the costs of planning the needs and the management systems of information are related to the planning of the needs, the planning of the supply of the finished product,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
the costs incurred during the search and acquisition of materials.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:28.000
In conclusion, I would like to note that since the management strategy of the supply system is inextricably linked with the strategy of the company as a whole, you need to choose the criteria for assessing the work of the system, which would accurately show the compliance of the current situation with the goals set.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000
There are many definitions of strategic planning.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.000
One of the pioneers of the strategic approach, Peter Dracker, gives the following definition.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Strategic planning is a constant process of systematic decision-making in the field of entrepreneurship, with an understanding of the possible prospects of the organization, systematic efforts to implement these decisions and assess the results of these decisions in relation to the forecasts of the organization through constant feedback.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:17.000
In the context of defining a strategy, a question arises about what we need to do today in order to achieve our goals tomorrow.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:28.000
We can say that a strategy is an action plan designed to achieve specific short-term and long-term goals.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:43.000
In this regard, the management of the supply systems and the strategy for managing the supply systems should be clearly coordinated and tied to the overall strategy of the company.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:57.000
The key question is how the supply system can effectively influence the overall goals and the strategy of the company.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I would note the key word here â€“ effectively. It means more than just following the directives of the senior management. It means contributing to the process of strategic planning, in which the company's units and goals include the possibilities and problems of supply.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:32.000
When choosing a strategy for managing the supply system, managers should consider three levels of the strategy.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:51.000
The corporate level is the highest, that is, how to distribute resources most effectively. The level of the units. The decisions at this level are formed by the plans of a specific unit or department.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And the functional level is the plans that are put before a specific specialist and a specific function. There is no single term or name of a strategy that describes the entire cycle of the supply system.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:24.000
For example, Toyota uses the delivery of parts and materials exactly on time and the Kanban system for production.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:48.000
While the strategy of the realization of these vehicles can be described as a mixture of production for order for large dealers and production for warehouse for small dealers, who do not make an order, but buy what the company offers in the warehouse.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:04.000
The last way is the way of domestic car manufacturers, manufacturers of components, spare parts, etc. As in every discipline, there are problems in the supply system, which many specialists are working on.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Very often, the main problems are the following. 1. The implementation of the supply system as a corporate practice. 2. The implementation of technologies. 3. The determination of the structure of the organization and the supply system. 4. Overcoming distrust and establishing partnership between systems and elements within the organization.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000
5. Determination of roles and responsibility zones. 6. Selection of necessary specialists with the necessary knowledge and skills. 7. Areas for further study.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The goals of the supply system. At present, many organizations focus on the effective structure within the organization. In the future, it is recommended to focus on the expanded connections with suppliers and consumers.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:34.000
The content of the supply system strategy. The functional strategy is integrated as part of the general strategy of the supply system to achieve improvements in the company's overall performance. This is what should be strived for.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:13:03.000
The support of the general strategy of the company. At present, the strategies of the supply system are focused on planning, search, production, delivery.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:23.000
In the future, it is proposed to coordinate not only these five elements, but also to achieve success in the field of marketing, sales, service technologies and the strategic development of fundamentally new products.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:43.000
The segmentation of the supply system. One model or set of possible systems and the goals of the supply system dominate. This is how many systems work at the moment. And the possibility of applying other systems and models is limited.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It is proposed to study a multimodal or a multitude of models for managing the supply system for effective work in rapidly changing conditions.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:23.000
The expansion beyond the framework of one enterprise. Despite the fact that a large number of enterprises understand the need for expansion and deepening of effective relations with external organizations, the actions of the supply system are still aimed at solving and optimizing relations with suppliers and customers within the company.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:26.000
The main elements of the system are the main elements of their functioning and role in the overall chain. The main indicators of the measurement of the efficiency of the work, the main definitions of the elements of the supply system, and the main indicators of the efficiency of the supply system are the main elements of the system.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
The main indicators of the efficiency of the supply system are the main elements of the system.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Thus, you can understand the main tasks and goals of the supply system, distinguish the main elements, know their functional tasks, understand how these elements interact with each other, have the opportunity to determine the main elements of a particular enterprise and give a general assessment or determine the criteria for the efficiency of their supply system.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Let's focus on the main recommendations. There are five basic principles of the organization of the supply system. They are at the heart of the system of the highest quality.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:33.000
They allow to create a system that will constantly allow to achieve success, to achieve competitive advantage. These are the five principles.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Consider your supply system as a strategic asset of the company. Create a clear scheme of processes from start to finish. Develop an organizational structure that will allow you to use personnel resources in the best way.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Create a model of management of the supply system that will allow to maximize the involvement of all participants in the supply system. Use and apply the indicators of the efficiency of the enterprise to achieve the goals set.
