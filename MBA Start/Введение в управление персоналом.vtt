00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello, colleagues. My name is Smirnova Nadezhda. I work in the Moscow Business School. I teach

00:14.000 --> 00:20.800
at the Russian Academy of Sciences named after Plikhanov. I am a candidate for economics

00:20.800 --> 00:31.800
and a lecturer. I have more than 30 consulting projects behind me, some of which are dedicated

00:31.800 --> 00:38.800
to the management of human resources at the enterprise. Today we will talk about the introductory

00:38.800 --> 00:46.800
course in the management of human resources. We will talk with you about the introduction

00:46.800 --> 00:55.800
of the management system of human resources, we will talk about how the HR strategy is

00:55.800 --> 01:03.800
developed and implemented at the enterprise, and we will pay attention to how the efficiency

01:03.800 --> 01:10.800
of the HR service is assessed. For the owners of the company, the goal of their activities

01:10.800 --> 01:18.800
is to ensure the quality of their business. Today, when an assessment is made of an enterprise,

01:18.800 --> 01:25.800
the correlation between the main assets and the market value is assessed in a slightly different

01:25.800 --> 01:31.800
way than some time ago. Previously, it was believed that the market value was mainly determined

01:32.800 --> 01:40.800
by the main assets of the enterprise. The share was about 90%. At the moment, this share has

01:40.800 --> 01:48.800
decreased. An important role in the formation of the company's value is played by the brand,

01:48.800 --> 01:57.800
the value of human capital, personnel, people, and, of course, the know-how technologies that

01:58.800 --> 02:06.800
the company possesses. We are talking about human resources, about personnel. As a rule,

02:06.800 --> 02:14.800
in Western companies, we observe a situation where the percentage of the company's market

02:14.800 --> 02:22.800
value from the value of the personnel is up to 35%. Traditionally, it was believed that the

02:23.800 --> 02:31.800
personnel is a cost factor. The expenses for the personnel are costs. In the mergers and

02:31.800 --> 02:39.800
acquisitions, these costs were not taken into account, and the cost of the personnel was not

02:39.800 --> 02:45.800
taken into account either. Accordingly, the HR service was considered as the center of costs.

02:46.800 --> 02:54.800
The HR service was self-managed. The owners were not interested in its activities. The main

02:54.800 --> 03:02.800
thing is that there were no lawsuits. If we talk about development, we are now observing

03:02.800 --> 03:08.800
a situation where the costs for the employees are considered as investments. Accordingly,

03:08.800 --> 03:15.800
human capital, its value is taken into account in mergers and acquisitions. HR becomes a

03:15.800 --> 03:23.800
business partner. This means that it participates in the development of the company's business

03:23.800 --> 03:32.800
goals and business strategies. It does not only formally process the company's strategy,

03:33.800 --> 03:41.800
it also participates in this process. Moreover, when evaluating the activities and values that the

03:41.800 --> 03:49.800
HR service brings into the company's activities, not only the managers of this service, but also

03:49.800 --> 03:57.800
the managers of other companies' departments, who take into account the financial side, the

03:58.800 --> 04:06.800
side related to the market development in the HR service's activities, are considered.

04:06.800 --> 04:14.800
Naturally, in such a state, the activities of the HR director and his services influence the

04:14.800 --> 04:22.800
company as a whole, form value both for internal and external clients. This means that the

04:23.800 --> 04:30.800
owners begin to be interested in the HR service's position.

04:30.800 --> 04:38.800
At one time, the famous economist and manager Mr. Ulerich said that the management system

04:38.800 --> 04:46.800
and human resources can become the source of such capabilities of an organization that will

04:47.800 --> 04:54.800
be able to use new opportunities for its own benefit.

04:54.800 --> 05:02.800
It is not for nothing that the economic theory says that one of the most important factors

05:02.800 --> 05:10.800
of production is human capital, or as it is commonly called in slang, labor. Human capital

05:11.800 --> 05:18.800
is a huge asset. It is a huge asset that is not only a human capital, but also a source

05:18.800 --> 05:25.800
of human resources. We buy human resources, but unlike machines, human resources eventually

05:25.800 --> 05:32.800
gain value, because they have the opportunity to learn by themselves and learn by the policy

05:32.800 --> 05:35.800
and procedures provided by the company.

05:36.800 --> 05:43.800
The HR director and his services are responsible for the management of human resources.

05:43.800 --> 05:50.800
It can be said that there are only four important goals for the HR service.

05:50.800 --> 05:58.800
They are to create a path of choice for the central self-management mechanism, that is,

05:59.800 --> 06:07.800
to determine the main guidelines for the participants of internal processes and procedures,

06:07.800 --> 06:13.800
to form effective internal procedures and processes.

06:13.800 --> 06:21.800
Another goal is to form motivational motives for the staff. The motives that will allow

06:22.800 --> 06:30.800
the person who works in this company to realize his personal goals through the achievement

06:30.800 --> 06:38.800
of the company's goals. That is, the motives that the person will have will be responsible

06:38.800 --> 06:42.800
for the company's strategy of development.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.800
Another goal of the HR service is to ensure transparency. This means that the regulation

06:49.800 --> 06:55.800
of procedures and relations, the establishment of corporate culture, the establishment of

06:55.800 --> 07:01.800
a chain of career growth, professional growth, the establishment of a fair reward system.

07:01.800 --> 07:07.800
And probably the last goal that should be noted is the goal related to the creation of a positive

07:07.800 --> 07:15.800
psychological climate, with the creation of trust in the company, in the organization of

07:16.800 --> 07:24.800
the company, in the organization of the employees. Moreover, we live in a very dynamic world,

07:24.800 --> 07:32.800
and therefore the company is forced to constantly change in accordance with changing external

07:32.800 --> 07:38.800
conditions. Or maybe it is necessary to change these external conditions.

07:39.800 --> 07:45.800
Of course, this is impossible without something changing inside the company.

07:45.800 --> 07:53.800
And this means that the HR, the head of staff, is faced with issues related to the organization

07:53.800 --> 08:01.800
of internal changes, which are impossible without the formation of loyalty of the staff,

08:01.800 --> 08:05.800
without defining internal rules.

08:09.800 --> 08:17.800
The first model that we will consider within the framework of this topic is the Harvard

08:17.800 --> 08:25.800
model of the human resources management system. This model was proposed by the famous economist

08:25.800 --> 08:33.800
Beer. The model assumes that the choice of HR policy, that is, the choice of policy of

08:34.800 --> 08:40.800
the impact on the employee, the choice of the policy of the formation of a reward system or

08:40.800 --> 08:48.800
a system of motivation of the staff, and so on, it is not just a wish of the owner or the

08:48.800 --> 08:56.800
head of the service. It is formed by analyzing the situation in which the company exists.

08:57.800 --> 09:03.800
These are external factors characterized, for example, by demographic conditions.

09:03.800 --> 09:09.800
These are internal factors, for example, characteristics related to the philosophy of management,

09:09.800 --> 09:13.800
which is used in the company.

09:13.800 --> 09:19.800
Of course, the choice of policy in the field of HR is not just a wish of the owner or the

09:20.800 --> 09:26.800
head of the service. The choice of policy in the field of HR is made taking into account

09:26.800 --> 09:32.800
the interests of all interested groups, that is, internal and external clients.

09:32.800 --> 09:38.800
Line managers, employees and owners are certainly related to internal clients.

09:38.800 --> 09:44.800
If we talk about external interested parties, then this is a very important issue.

09:45.800 --> 09:51.800
If we talk about external interested parties, then this is a very important issue.

09:51.800 --> 09:57.800
We are talking about the local community, about clients, about investors.

09:57.800 --> 10:03.800
All this imposes a certain imprint, which should be reflected when developing HR strategy,

10:03.800 --> 10:07.800
HR policy.

10:07.800 --> 10:13.800
After the implementation, we get some results.

10:13.800 --> 10:19.800
We achieve adherence, we achieve higher efficiency of activities.

10:19.800 --> 10:25.800
The costs that were carried out become more effective.

10:25.800 --> 10:31.800
Thus, we have some long-term consequences related to organizational efficiency,

10:32.800 --> 10:38.800
related to the growth of public welfare.

10:38.800 --> 10:44.800
These long-term consequences close our model.

10:44.800 --> 10:50.800
They influence the situation in which the company exists,

10:50.800 --> 10:56.800
and the interests of stakeholders, who we had to take into account in HR policy.

10:56.800 --> 11:02.800
Because then we diagnose stakeholders' interests again,

11:02.800 --> 11:08.800
we diagnose the situation in the company again,

11:08.800 --> 11:14.800
and we correct the policy in the field of HR.

11:14.800 --> 11:20.800
We get new results in accordance with the tasks set.

11:20.800 --> 11:26.800
At the same time, another model is being developed,

11:26.800 --> 11:32.800
which was called HR cycle.

11:32.800 --> 11:38.800
It was developed by Fond Brunon.

11:38.800 --> 11:44.800
This model tells us that the most important factor that we would like to achieve

11:45.800 --> 11:51.800
in the field of HR is the productivity of the work,

11:51.800 --> 11:57.800
in fact, the efficiency of the results of the company's employees.

11:57.800 --> 12:03.800
Of course, all the HR practices that must be carried out at the enterprise

12:03.800 --> 12:09.800
have an impact on this important category.

12:09.800 --> 12:15.800
This includes selection of staff, assessment of staff,

12:15.800 --> 12:21.800
system of rewards and development of staff.

12:21.800 --> 12:27.800
Note that selection and development of staff are connected by a dotted line.

12:27.800 --> 12:33.800
There is also an influence between them.

12:33.800 --> 12:39.800
If a company is ready to grow its staff from a young age,

12:39.800 --> 12:45.800
and, for example, it takes students of the second year,

12:45.800 --> 12:51.800
and attracts them to a particular activity

12:51.800 --> 12:57.800
in order to get loyal employees in the future,

12:57.800 --> 13:05.800
then it will take significant investment to develop these young guys.

13:13.800 --> 13:21.800
At the same time, if a company decides that its strategy is to buy heads,

13:21.800 --> 13:29.800
then we believe that they will develop in a different place,

13:29.800 --> 13:35.800
and we will use the results of this development.

13:35.800 --> 13:41.800
Patricia McLagan proposed the HR Practice wheel model,

13:41.800 --> 13:49.800
which showed that the results and value of the HR activities

13:49.800 --> 13:57.800
are connected with certain roles,

13:57.800 --> 14:05.800
which should be performed by a HR specialist.

14:05.800 --> 14:11.800
These roles and the model are presented in the support conspectus.

14:11.800 --> 14:17.800
Here we can talk about the standard things that we are used to.

14:17.800 --> 14:23.800
This is planning and selection of staff, management of rewards,

14:23.800 --> 14:31.800
assistance to the employee when he comes to the staff service and tells his problems,

14:31.800 --> 14:43.800
this is the relationship with public and state bodies of control and management in the field of staff,

14:43.800 --> 14:53.800
but there are also those areas that are currently developing at many enterprises.

14:53.800 --> 15:05.800
For example, at many enterprises, it is now quite relevant to introduce systems for managing the effectiveness of activities.

15:05.800 --> 15:11.800
Or those companies, as a rule, large companies,

15:11.800 --> 15:19.800
which build their system, their activities, planning and development of staff,

15:19.800 --> 15:27.800
there are usually corporate universities or training centers.

15:27.800 --> 15:37.800
All this is the role that specialists in staff management are forced to perform.

15:37.800 --> 15:45.800
At the same time, the staff service creates a valuable offer in its activities,

15:45.800 --> 15:55.800
and this is an important factor in reviewing the position of the HR service and its manager in business,

15:55.800 --> 16:03.800
that is, the perception of the manager of the staff management service as a business partner.

16:03.800 --> 16:11.800
In its activities, when the company implements its strategic goals,

16:11.800 --> 16:19.800
when the task and goals of the staff service are formed,

16:19.800 --> 16:27.800
its activities are assessed from the position of efficiency and value for the business.

16:28.800 --> 16:36.800
For example, when we talk about the fact that the HR service should take into account the external and internal environment with which it works,

16:36.800 --> 16:43.800
we are talking about the fact that the value that the HR service creates is that,

16:43.800 --> 16:48.800
based on the analysis of the external market, for example, benchmarking,

16:49.800 --> 16:57.800
the HR service can adapt and implement the best practices that exist at other enterprises,

16:57.800 --> 17:01.800
and best distribute resources.

17:01.800 --> 17:08.800
When we talk about the fact that the task of the HR service is to comply with the interests of internal and external clients,

17:08.800 --> 17:17.800
we are talking about the fact that within this activity, within this task,

17:17.800 --> 17:26.800
the HR service creates non-material values, increases the client share,

17:26.800 --> 17:34.800
expands organizational capabilities that are so necessary for the company's linear manager.

17:39.800 --> 17:45.800
When we talk about creating a staff management system,

17:45.800 --> 17:50.800
we mean that the HR service and its employees should be engaged in process management,

17:50.800 --> 17:54.800
of course, those that are related to the staff.

17:54.800 --> 18:06.800
They should be engaged in procedures and mechanisms of managing the efficiency of work,

18:06.800 --> 18:13.800
connecting this with the achievement of the company's business goals.

18:13.800 --> 18:18.800
On the other hand, the development of the staff is also a very important task,

18:18.800 --> 18:24.800
and here we are talking about strategic planning in accordance with the company's tasks.

18:24.800 --> 18:32.800
And finally, the HR service itself should also develop, and professionals should work in it.

18:32.800 --> 18:44.800
Therefore, the training and development of employees of the staff management service is also an important task of its manager.

18:44.800 --> 18:57.800
If we show the place where the staff management system is located in the general system of company management,

18:57.800 --> 19:05.800
then, as you can see on the slide, we can say that, on the one hand,

19:06.800 --> 19:11.800
the company develops a business strategy, vision, and mission.

19:11.800 --> 19:22.800
In order to track the company's goals, mechanisms and tools such as a balanced system of indicators,

19:22.800 --> 19:27.800
or goal management, or indicators of efficiency of activity are used,

19:27.800 --> 19:44.800
which are then integrated into the organizational culture of the company by the staff management system.

19:44.800 --> 19:53.800
At the same time, there is a kind of redistribution of roles.

19:53.800 --> 20:09.800
If earlier the line managers perceived the department or the staff management service as the unit that serves them,

20:09.800 --> 20:20.800
then at the moment more and more functions related to the development of the staff are switched to the line manager.

20:20.800 --> 20:30.800
So, the HR service is engaged in selection, development, planning, budgeting for the staff.

20:30.800 --> 20:42.800
Line managers manage the results, track the payment chain for incentives, and train and develop the staff.

20:43.800 --> 20:58.800
Naturally, the staff and the working groups that are represented in the company report on their activities to the managers and are serviced by the HR service.

20:58.800 --> 21:10.800
When we talk about the HR service organization, we mean that various functions that it can perform can be organized in different ways.

21:10.800 --> 21:17.800
It can be performed by the HR service itself, by its specialists, it can be outsourced.

21:17.800 --> 21:27.800
In 1991, Mr. Adams was given four approaches to human resources management.

21:27.800 --> 21:33.800
He considered the staff service as an internal agency.

21:34.800 --> 21:42.800
Then this center was considered as an internal consulting service for the company.

21:42.800 --> 21:49.800
Then the HR service sells its services to all other departments.

21:49.800 --> 21:54.800
But other departments have some freedom.

21:54.800 --> 22:02.800
They can apply not only to their HR service, but also to any other provider.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.800
For example, to training.

22:04.800 --> 22:17.800
Finally, the third approach to the HR service organization was given by Mr. Adams to the enterprise within the enterprise.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.800
Here, the emphasis is changed.

22:20.800 --> 22:30.800
Yes, of course, internal departments can buy services, buy in quotation marks, services of the HR service.

22:30.800 --> 22:41.800
But the HR service is practically a free, independent structural unit.

22:41.800 --> 22:51.800
It can go to the market and, accordingly, provide services to other companies on the open market, on the external market.

22:52.800 --> 23:01.800
In particular, large holdings where famous universities, corporate universities are created, are engaged in this.

23:01.800 --> 23:11.800
External consulting group is another approach to the construction of the HR service.

23:11.800 --> 23:20.800
When, in principle, all the activity of the HR service is transferred to outsourcing, to external providers.

23:20.800 --> 23:28.800
Of course, all these approaches are implemented today on the Russian market.

23:28.800 --> 23:35.800
But each company chooses the most convenient way for itself.

23:35.800 --> 23:43.800
However, we observe a common feature, characteristic of any organization.

23:44.800 --> 23:55.800
The fact is that the service and services for HR are paid.

23:55.800 --> 24:03.800
They are paid for internal departments, they are paid for external providers.

24:04.800 --> 24:17.800
At the same time, there is another approach, when it is not only about how the HR service is organized,

24:17.800 --> 24:21.800
who it is, whether it is free or not very free at the enterprise.

24:22.800 --> 24:35.800
And also when the main roles that this department performs in the company and its head are assessed.

24:35.800 --> 24:44.800
In particular, Dave Ullrich highlighted four main roles of a modern HR director.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.800
First of all, it is a business partner.

24:47.800 --> 24:58.800
This is a business partner of other top managers who participate in determining the strategy of the company,

24:58.800 --> 25:03.800
vision of the future and organization of development.

25:03.800 --> 25:08.800
And in fact, they participate in all these processes.

25:09.800 --> 25:18.800
Moreover, if we look at Russian companies, then in many companies where partnerships are adopted, HR becomes a partner.

25:18.800 --> 25:27.800
A classic example that I can give right now is the well-known company BDO Unicorn in the consulting circles,

25:27.800 --> 25:35.800
in which the head of the HR service is a business partner.

25:35.800 --> 25:45.800
The second role that the HR service performs is a role related to the support of processes,

25:45.800 --> 25:50.800
contributing to the implementation of organizational transformations in the company,

25:50.800 --> 26:00.800
and, accordingly, to the support of those actions in the direction of the development of the company,

26:01.800 --> 26:05.800
in which he participated as a business partner.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.800
The third role is infrastructure,

26:09.800 --> 26:18.800
because it is very important to build effective and successful business processes in the company.

26:18.800 --> 26:25.800
And finally, the HR service is a guarantor of loyalty and commitment of employees.

26:26.800 --> 26:36.800
These processes contribute to the awareness of employees and the desire of the employee to work in this company,

26:36.800 --> 26:44.800
to trust these managers, and, accordingly, this contributes to the growth of the company itself.

26:44.800 --> 26:51.800
Now, please, complete the task for this topic, which is presented in your workbooks.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.800
The next topic is HR strategy.

26:58.800 --> 27:05.800
When we talk about the development of the HR service,

27:05.800 --> 27:10.800
about its importance at the moment in the company,

27:10.800 --> 27:20.800
about this topic, we should remember that the HR strategy is a very important part of the company.

27:20.800 --> 27:26.800
And when we talk about the real moment in the company,

27:26.800 --> 27:33.800
about the value that the specialists of this service create,

27:33.800 --> 27:47.800
we understand that all their activity is associated with the achievement of the strategy and strategic goals that are set before the company.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.800
And, of course, if we take Russian companies,

27:51.800 --> 27:58.800
not all of them have a formalized strategy.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.800
Not all of them have a formalized strategy,

28:03.800 --> 28:10.800
which is really what tasks are in front of them and what they want to achieve.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.800
Sometimes it's just a piece of paper that lies on the shelf.

28:14.800 --> 28:19.800
Moreover, even if there is a strategy,

28:19.800 --> 28:28.800
and this is exactly what the owners and employees of the company want to achieve,

28:28.800 --> 28:39.800
only 33% of HR services associate their activity with the company's strategy.

28:39.800 --> 28:47.800
Only 34% of companies perceive the HR service as a business partner.

28:47.800 --> 29:00.800
Only 23% of companies include the development of such a functional strategy as the HR strategy in the strategic planning process.

29:00.800 --> 29:06.800
At the same time, you know the pyramid of strategies.

29:06.800 --> 29:12.800
At the top there is a corporate strategy, at the bottom there is an operational strategy, and somewhere in the middle there is a functional strategy.

29:12.800 --> 29:17.800
These are the strategies that are developed for functional areas.

29:17.800 --> 29:24.800
One of these functional areas is the management of HR,

29:24.800 --> 29:27.800
management of human resources.

29:28.800 --> 29:37.800
Of course, there should be a connection between the coordination from top to bottom,

29:37.800 --> 29:45.800
that is, from the corporate strategy, the business strategy of the company, to the functional strategy.

29:45.800 --> 29:52.800
That is, every goal that was developed and set for the company

29:52.800 --> 29:59.800
should be transformed into a goal that will be achieved by the functional direction of the company,

29:59.800 --> 30:03.800
the direction of HR.

30:03.800 --> 30:04.800
On the one hand.

30:04.800 --> 30:11.800
On the other hand, in addition to such vertical integration, horizontal integration is also necessary.

30:11.800 --> 30:20.800
We understand that in order to make it clear where to move in the area of human resources management,

30:20.800 --> 30:23.800
that is, the HR strategy has been developed,

30:23.800 --> 30:32.800
we need those subsections of it, which are commonly called instrumental strategies,

30:32.800 --> 30:40.800
the reward system strategy, the recruitment hiring strategy, the adaptation strategy of the staff,

30:40.800 --> 30:45.800
the management strategy, efficiency, and so on, so that they are also coordinated.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.800
In order to avoid the following situation in life,

30:48.800 --> 30:53.800
a crocodile in one direction, a pike in the other, a swan in the third, in heaven.

30:53.800 --> 31:01.800
The fact is that the achievement of this coordination, integration, and congruence,

31:01.800 --> 31:07.800
can be called in different ways, requires certain actions from the service side.

31:07.800 --> 31:11.800
Namely, if we are talking about vertical integration,

31:11.800 --> 31:16.800
then here, at least, we need to understand what strategic goals are in front of the company.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.800
It is not easy to understand.

31:18.800 --> 31:24.800
You also need to know what skills and what behavior are required from the staff

31:24.800 --> 31:30.800
so that the company's strategy is achieved, is implemented.

31:31.800 --> 31:40.800
In addition, you need to have some skills in technologies

31:40.800 --> 31:50.800
that will allow us to achieve the corresponding behavior from the people who work in our company,

31:50.800 --> 31:57.800
and will allow us to develop the required skills that are required for the implementation of the business strategy.

31:57.800 --> 32:05.800
And since the process of strategic planning and the process of developing a strategy is a permanent process,

32:05.800 --> 32:06.800
it is constant.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.800
It is not in vain that they say that as soon as the strategy is developed,

32:09.800 --> 32:12.800
then we start developing it again.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.800
It cannot be developed for centuries.

32:14.800 --> 32:21.800
Therefore, it turns out that another necessary condition for integration

32:22.800 --> 32:27.800
is the ability to quickly implement the desired technologies,

32:27.800 --> 32:31.800
to quickly change the way the company lives.

32:33.800 --> 32:38.800
And this, again, is a problem related to human resources management,

32:38.800 --> 32:43.800
and a problem related to the fact that we, as people, all do not like uncertainty.

32:43.800 --> 32:47.800
We all want to know what will happen tomorrow.

32:47.800 --> 32:52.800
When changes occur, what will happen tomorrow, we can only assume.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.800
And this means that we begin to resist.

32:55.800 --> 33:02.800
And this is another of the tasks that are before the staff management service.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.800
How does horizontal coordination achieve?

33:06.800 --> 33:07.800
And why is it necessary?

33:07.800 --> 33:14.800
I have already said that horizontal coordination is necessary for all the strategies of the instrumental nature

33:14.800 --> 33:22.800
that is used by the staff management service to support each other.

33:22.800 --> 33:29.800
This can only be achieved if we tie them together.

33:29.800 --> 33:34.800
In fact, this is the translation of the term

33:34.800 --> 33:36.800
– tying together.

33:36.800 --> 33:43.800
And for this we need, again, to analyze the needs and features of the company,

33:43.800 --> 33:50.800
to assess how HR strategy can satisfy the needs and features of the company.

33:50.800 --> 33:57.800
We need to find and identify the behavior that is required of the employees.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.800
We need to assess the practice that we are using now,

34:02.800 --> 34:05.800
to find difficulties, deviations,

34:05.800 --> 34:08.800
and, most importantly, to decide on the main point

34:09.800 --> 34:16.800
that will be the connecting line of all instrumental strategies.

34:16.800 --> 34:26.800
For example, we say that each of the strategies will use, for example, efficiency indicators.

34:26.800 --> 34:33.800
Okay. If this is so, then we must assume.

34:33.800 --> 34:38.800
For example, we want to become a leader in costs.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.800
Therefore, we need to reduce these costs,

34:42.800 --> 34:46.800
to conduct certain activities that will lead to a reduction in costs.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.800
For this, we introduce efficiency indicators.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.800
We want our people to work more effectively.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.800
Then we start to consider instrumental strategies.

34:57.800 --> 35:02.800
In order not only to integrate the functional management strategy of the staff

35:02.800 --> 35:06.800
with the business strategy of the company vertically, but also horizontally.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.800
Therefore, what do we do next?

35:09.800 --> 35:13.800
We look at how we need to select the staff.

35:13.800 --> 35:25.800
We need to select the staff so that he can use the system of indicators,

35:25.800 --> 35:30.800
so that his skills correspond to what he will be asked.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.800
If we are talking about rewards,

35:33.800 --> 35:36.800
then we should have a certain bonus pool,

35:36.800 --> 35:40.800
which we will distribute among employees in the form of bonuses,

35:40.800 --> 35:43.800
that is, a variable part of the wage,

35:43.800 --> 35:47.800
using efficiency indicators and their assessment.

35:47.800 --> 35:52.800
How will we build a staff reserve?

35:52.800 --> 36:01.800
Based on the results that the analysis and audit of the system of indicators will show us.

36:01.800 --> 36:11.800
Accordingly, we connect each instrumental strategy horizontally,

36:11.800 --> 36:14.800
we string it on a single technology.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.800
Consequently, each of our actions will be strengthened,

36:19.800 --> 36:22.800
will be carried out in the same direction,

36:22.800 --> 36:25.800
there will be no contradictions.

36:25.800 --> 36:30.800
At the same time, note that when we have developed a strategy,

36:30.800 --> 36:34.800
we must answer the question,

36:34.800 --> 36:37.800
is it good, is it applicable?

36:37.800 --> 36:40.800
For this, some criteria are needed for assessment.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.800
There are many such criteria,

36:44.800 --> 36:47.800
but if you try to combine them,

36:47.800 --> 36:51.800
you can see the following on the slide.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.800
You must answer a number of questions positively.

36:55.800 --> 37:01.800
The first question is whether the management strategy contributes to the implementation of the business strategy.

37:01.800 --> 37:06.800
The second question is whether it manages the company's values,

37:06.800 --> 37:08.800
whether it strengthens them.

37:08.800 --> 37:12.800
The third question is whether it is based on diagnostic analysis.

37:12.800 --> 37:19.800
The fourth question is whether it explains how the company's needs will be satisfied.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.800
Has the assessment of the costs and results been carried out?

37:22.800 --> 37:26.800
Next, is this strategy profitable?

37:26.800 --> 37:32.800
And finally, are the processes that are embedded in the staff management strategy,

37:33.800 --> 37:38.800
communication programs, efficiency management, and so on.

37:38.800 --> 37:45.800
At the same time, any negative answer leads to the fact that the strategy cannot be implemented.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.800
It is detached from life.

37:48.800 --> 37:56.800
For example, one of the metallurgical companies began to develop a staff management strategy.

37:57.800 --> 38:01.800
At the same time, as is usually the case,

38:01.800 --> 38:08.800
the process of diagnosis was carried out by the management.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.800
We know ourselves.

38:10.800 --> 38:16.800
As a result, we got a beautiful strategy from the textbook.

38:16.800 --> 38:21.800
We wrote what we would like to be.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.800
But the methods that we have laid down in the strategy,

38:26.800 --> 38:30.800
the strategy actually implies a fairly simple set.

38:30.800 --> 38:36.800
What we want to be, what we are, the starting point and the end point,

38:36.800 --> 38:39.800
where we need to go, and the path.

38:39.800 --> 38:44.800
So, due to the fact that it was not clear where we were going,

38:44.800 --> 38:48.800
the diagnosis was not carried out, the path was definitely not the right one.

38:48.800 --> 38:53.800
And the beautiful picture of the future of the company,

38:53.800 --> 38:57.800
alas, was not achieved.

38:57.800 --> 39:03.800
Although, a year later, an audit was conducted of what the company should have been.

39:03.800 --> 39:13.800
And it turned out that many of the actions that were laid down in the staff development program

39:14.800 --> 39:18.800
did not bring any results.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.800
It was money thrown in the wind.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.800
Another example.

39:25.800 --> 39:30.800
The most famous telecommunications company, the Russian company,

39:30.800 --> 39:36.800
decided that it was necessary to develop a staff management strategy.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.800
A huge budget was allocated.

39:39.800 --> 39:44.800
Only the business strategy was not yet formalized,

39:44.800 --> 39:49.800
not yet designed in the process of the idea of the owners.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.800
It was even in the heads of the owners.

39:53.800 --> 39:57.800
Only to their subordinates and top managers they did not convey.

39:57.800 --> 40:02.800
Accordingly, they could only guess what the owner wanted,

40:02.800 --> 40:04.800
and where we were going.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.800
As a result, the guess was unsuccessful.

40:08.800 --> 40:16.800
When the owner was presented with a strategy of managing human resources,

40:16.800 --> 40:19.800
it turned out that the owner was doing everything differently,

40:19.800 --> 40:23.800
simply because the goals of the business were completely different.

40:23.800 --> 40:24.800
Let's move on.

40:26.800 --> 40:32.800
When we develop a strategy, we need to take into account a number of factors.

40:32.800 --> 40:37.800
These factors, as I said, can be divided into external and internal.

40:37.800 --> 40:41.800
On the one hand, this is the position of the company in the market,

40:41.800 --> 40:44.800
as an example of an external factor.

40:44.800 --> 40:50.800
The presence of specialists in the field of management in the market.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.800
Demand and supply in the labor market.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.800
On the other hand, this is a number of internal factors.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.800
The policy of investment in human capital.

40:59.800 --> 41:05.800
The size, age of the company, its history, its values, its goals,

41:05.800 --> 41:10.800
its organizational culture, and finally, the personality of the manager.

41:10.800 --> 41:16.800
And, of course, which specialists our staff consists of.

41:16.800 --> 41:24.800
All these factors should be taken into account when developing a strategy of managing human resources.

41:24.800 --> 41:33.800
Let's see how the age of the company can affect the strategy.

41:33.800 --> 41:40.800
First, the business strategy, and then, of course, the strategy of managing staff.

41:40.800 --> 41:44.800
In the diagrams presented in your support conspectus,

41:45.800 --> 41:51.800
there is a model developed by Greiner,

41:51.800 --> 41:56.800
which takes into account the dependence between the age of the organization,

41:56.800 --> 42:01.800
its size, and what is happening in it.

42:01.800 --> 42:05.800
Greiner highlights five types of practice.

42:05.800 --> 42:11.800
Five stages that any company goes through in its development.

42:11.800 --> 42:18.800
Growth through creativity, management, delegation, coordination, and cooperation.

42:18.800 --> 42:24.800
In fact, there are quite a few models that take into account the age of the company,

42:24.800 --> 42:35.800
and that link the age of the company, its size, with the strategy that is implemented in it.

42:35.800 --> 42:42.800
For example, a similar model can be called the Azizos model.

42:42.800 --> 42:47.800
But the most important thing in these models is that at each stage of development

42:47.800 --> 42:52.800
a certain organizational structure is assigned, a certain control system,

42:52.800 --> 42:58.800
certain crisis stages are identified, how they are accompanied,

42:58.800 --> 43:07.800
and certain strategic management tasks can be assigned to each stage.

43:07.800 --> 43:08.800
Let's see.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.800
So, growth through creativity.

43:11.800 --> 43:16.800
At this stage, the company is in the infancy stage.

43:16.800 --> 43:23.800
The company management is busy promoting a new product to the market.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.800
The main task is to produce and sell them.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.800
Accordingly, organizational culture is informal.

43:30.800 --> 43:36.800
Everyone often communicates with each other creatively, referring to a new product.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.800
And the management style?

43:39.800 --> 43:43.800
It is individualistic, it is entrepreneurial.

43:43.800 --> 43:47.800
The control system is only based on market results.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.800
Reward?

43:49.800 --> 43:52.800
The reward is not great.

43:52.800 --> 43:55.800
Basically, it is the future.

43:56.800 --> 44:00.800
For example, the message is that if the company is successful,

44:00.800 --> 44:04.800
it will be a participation in the profit, participation in the property.

44:04.800 --> 44:10.800
When the infancy stage and growth through creativity reaches its peak,

44:10.800 --> 44:12.800
a crisis can occur.

44:12.800 --> 44:16.800
A crisis associated with the market vulnerability of the company,

44:16.800 --> 44:21.800
because there is no time for the company's own management system and hands do not reach.

44:22.800 --> 44:27.800
This crisis is accompanied by the fact that the company is growing,

44:27.800 --> 44:30.800
and the management is not effective.

44:30.800 --> 44:35.800
Here the main task of the head of staff management,

44:35.800 --> 44:40.800
which in fact in such companies may not be,

44:40.800 --> 44:45.800
due to the fact that the company is still small, small in size.

44:45.800 --> 44:51.800
And the functions of the management of the staff are distributed among many managers.

44:51.800 --> 44:55.800
As a result, what do we have?

44:55.800 --> 45:04.800
We have a situation when it is necessary to switch to professional management,

45:04.800 --> 45:06.800
the company has grown to this size,

45:06.800 --> 45:10.800
and it is necessary to delegate power, which is quite difficult to do.

45:10.800 --> 45:15.800
If the company overcomes the crisis of market vulnerability,

45:15.800 --> 45:19.800
it goes to the next stage, the stage of the management.

45:19.800 --> 45:26.800
Here the priority is on the company's management system,

45:26.800 --> 45:32.800
on the effectiveness of the operations that are carried out in the company.

45:32.800 --> 45:39.800
A functional or centralized organizational structure is introduced.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.800
It is hierarchical, respectively,

45:42.800 --> 45:48.800
this creates the need for a direct management.

45:48.800 --> 45:53.800
Control is carried out through introduced standards,

45:53.800 --> 45:58.800
which are quite strict, and through the control of costs.

45:58.800 --> 46:02.800
Each unit is the center of costs,

46:02.800 --> 46:09.800
and the budgets that are lowered and their implementation are controlled in each unit.

46:09.800 --> 46:18.800
As a rule, the reward system in such companies is related to the deposit system.

46:18.800 --> 46:27.800
And the deposits, the increase of the reward that the manager receives,

46:28.800 --> 46:33.800
can be carried out for the company's merits.

46:33.800 --> 46:38.800
And here, at a certain stage, a crisis may also arise,

46:38.800 --> 46:47.800
which is accompanied by an ineffective management middle management.

46:47.800 --> 46:54.800
As a rule, this is due to a sharp transition to professional management.

46:54.800 --> 47:00.800
Accordingly, the policy in the area of personnel management,

47:00.800 --> 47:05.800
management of human resources, should be aimed at structuring the authorities.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.800
And we enter the stage of delegation.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.800
The third stage of the company's development.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.800
The company is already large.

47:12.800 --> 47:16.800
The company is able to win the share of the market.

47:16.800 --> 47:22.800
As a rule, the strategy of geographical expansion is pursued here.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.800
That is, to win the share of the market.

47:25.800 --> 47:31.800
Such companies are decentralized and built on a geographical principle.

47:31.800 --> 47:36.800
There is a head company, which is located for Russian practice in Moscow,

47:36.800 --> 47:43.800
and many branches, factories scattered throughout other cities and cities.

47:44.800 --> 47:51.800
Therefore, the head must delegate authority to the places,

47:51.800 --> 47:54.800
in order to make operational decisions there.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.800
Control of reports and profits.

47:58.800 --> 48:05.800
Each such structural unit is perceived by the management as a center of profit.

48:05.800 --> 48:11.800
Reward for the profit, for bringing this profit to the organization,

48:11.800 --> 48:14.800
means a bonus system.

48:14.800 --> 48:19.800
But here, too, a crisis may arise at a certain stage.

48:19.800 --> 48:24.800
A crisis associated with autonomy, loss of control,

48:24.800 --> 48:27.800
with the emergence of corporate conflicts.

48:27.800 --> 48:35.800
The task of HR is to build a decentralized system and delegate authority.

48:35.800 --> 48:38.800
The company is growing.

48:38.800 --> 48:42.800
It has overcome this crisis and entered the coordination stage.

48:42.800 --> 48:45.800
The company is consolidated.

48:45.800 --> 48:50.800
As a rule, in this case, the organizational structure becomes linear-staff.

48:50.800 --> 48:57.800
There is a large managing company with a large number of staff.

48:57.800 --> 49:03.800
The managing company is provided with marketing functions,

49:04.800 --> 49:09.800
staff management functions, financial, and so on.

49:09.800 --> 49:15.800
Accordingly, this managing company for geographically distant business units

49:15.800 --> 49:18.800
acts as a watchdog.

49:18.800 --> 49:20.800
The system of control.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.800
We create a plan.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.800
We allocate investments.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.800
And then the assessment as an investment project.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.800
Be kind, return the investments.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.800
And with an increase.

49:32.800 --> 49:36.800
And, accordingly, management of the plan of fact analysis.

49:36.800 --> 49:40.800
The emphasis of the reward is made on the participation in the profits.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.800
And, in fact, on some options,

49:44.800 --> 49:47.800
if the company is able to provide shares,

49:47.800 --> 49:50.800
either natural or virtual,

49:50.800 --> 49:53.800
if the company has not yet entered the IPO.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.800
With the growth of the company at this stage,

49:57.800 --> 50:01.800
there may be a crisis of control and management.

50:01.800 --> 50:06.800
It is accompanied by the fact that as a result of decentralization,

50:06.800 --> 50:12.800
we observe that business units are trying to break free.

50:12.800 --> 50:18.800
Here, the task of the staff management unit

50:19.800 --> 50:22.800
is to build a coordination system of actions,

50:22.800 --> 50:25.800
coordination of the center, coordination of business units.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.800
And finally, the stage of cooperation.

50:29.800 --> 50:35.800
In principle, the priority of management is innovation.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
Innovation.

50:37.800 --> 50:42.800
As a rule, a matrix structure is used here.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.800
The matrix of teams.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.800
Teams that solve certain problems.

50:47.800 --> 50:50.800
Then the style of management becomes participatory.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.800
And control?

50:52.800 --> 50:57.800
Control is that a common goal is set for each team.

50:57.800 --> 51:01.800
This common goal the team has either achieved or not.

51:01.800 --> 51:05.800
And, of course, the emphasis of the reward is made on

51:05.800 --> 51:08.800
to encourage the team as a whole.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.800
Well, then the team will figure it out somehow.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.800
So team bonuses.

51:14.800 --> 51:17.800
However, a crisis may arise here.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.800
This is a crisis of trust.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.800
Trust of the team to the management.

51:21.800 --> 51:23.800
Trust within the team.

51:23.800 --> 51:27.800
The team can, if it does not trust the management,

51:27.800 --> 51:29.800
can simply leave the company.

51:29.800 --> 51:33.800
Especially since the Russian market is known for the practice of buying heads.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.800
Buying whole teams.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.800
We'll talk about this later today.

51:38.800 --> 51:40.800
On the other hand,

51:40.800 --> 51:44.800
motivation decreases, flexibility decreases,

51:44.800 --> 51:46.800
and the team can simply disperse,

51:46.800 --> 51:48.800
run in different directions.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.800
A classic example.

51:50.800 --> 51:54.800
How did the trust crisis arise in one of the companies?

51:54.800 --> 51:56.800
Four people.

51:56.800 --> 51:57.800
Four big friends.

51:57.800 --> 51:59.800
Four owners.

51:59.800 --> 52:03.800
The team works together for a long time.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.800
The business is developing.

52:06.800 --> 52:08.800
There comes a stage when

52:08.800 --> 52:14.800
some innovative idea is needed.

52:14.800 --> 52:17.800
They did not hear each other.

52:17.800 --> 52:18.800
Moreover,

52:18.800 --> 52:21.800
a trust crisis arose between them.

52:23.800 --> 52:26.800
One of the team members

52:26.800 --> 52:30.800
starts to open a new business in parallel.

52:30.800 --> 52:33.800
There he tries to implement those innovative ideas

52:33.800 --> 52:36.800
that were not heard by the team.

52:36.800 --> 52:38.800
As a result,

52:38.800 --> 52:40.800
he is removed from the business,

52:40.800 --> 52:42.800
and the team is broken up.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.800
The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.800
Moreover,

52:46.800 --> 52:50.800
the two owners left in the business

52:50.800 --> 52:54.800
are in a state of paranoia.

52:54.800 --> 52:59.800
They are afraid that their business will be seized

52:59.800 --> 53:02.800
by their former friends,

53:02.800 --> 53:05.800
associates, and team members.

53:05.800 --> 53:08.800
So, what can be done here?

53:08.800 --> 53:11.800
What is the task of the head of the personnel

53:11.800 --> 53:13.800
as a business partner?

53:13.800 --> 53:15.800
To build cooperation.

53:15.800 --> 53:17.800
To build bridges

53:17.800 --> 53:19.800
to overcome this crisis.

53:19.800 --> 53:22.800
Please note that

53:22.800 --> 53:26.800
in the support conspectus

53:26.800 --> 53:30.800
the linear model of Greiner

53:30.800 --> 53:33.800
is not really linear.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.800
It has declines and rises.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.800
It is cyclic.

53:37.800 --> 53:40.800
And nothing else develops in our life.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.800
There are declines and rises.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.800
With any rise,

53:45.800 --> 53:48.800
you can, accordingly, go down.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.800
You can go bankrupt.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.800
Whatever happens,

53:52.800 --> 53:55.800
we say that we need to find a way out of the crisis.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.800
Moreover,

53:57.800 --> 54:00.800
each of the stages allocated by Greiner

54:00.800 --> 54:04.800
is characterized by certain rules

54:04.800 --> 54:06.800
of building HR services.

54:06.800 --> 54:09.800
Even not rules, but structures

54:09.800 --> 54:13.800
that are typical for each of the stages.

54:13.800 --> 54:16.800
At the stage of growth through creativity,

54:16.800 --> 54:18.800
I have already talked about it,

54:18.800 --> 54:21.800
the manager may be absent.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.800
Or he will be alone.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.800
If he is alone,

54:25.800 --> 54:28.800
he performs absolutely all functions

54:28.800 --> 54:30.800
that are assigned to this service.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.800
If he is absent,

54:32.800 --> 54:36.800
the functions are redistributed among the linear managers.

54:36.800 --> 54:38.800
At the stage of the executive management,

54:38.800 --> 54:42.800
the staff is formed according to the functional characteristic.

54:42.800 --> 54:46.800
At the stage of delegation and coordination,

54:46.800 --> 54:50.800
the staff is assigned the duty

54:50.800 --> 54:53.800
to develop the strategy of managing staff

54:53.800 --> 54:55.800
and corporate ideology.

54:55.800 --> 55:00.800
Special attention is given to working with corporate culture.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.800
If we look at the research

55:02.800 --> 55:06.800
conducted by the consulting company COPSI,

55:06.800 --> 55:11.800
the survey of large companies

55:11.800 --> 55:15.800
showed that the technologies

55:15.800 --> 55:19.800
that the staff management service uses

55:19.800 --> 55:22.800
are based on the level of its development

55:22.800 --> 55:25.800
and the stage at which this company is located.

55:25.800 --> 55:29.800
So, if we talk about the stage

55:29.800 --> 55:32.800
that is typical for the storm growth,

55:32.800 --> 55:34.800
then, as a rule,

55:34.800 --> 55:37.800
the technology of the set is used here.

55:37.800 --> 55:43.800
Technologies related to the promotion of staff are used,

55:43.800 --> 55:45.800
first of all.

55:45.800 --> 55:50.800
When the company is at the stage of stability,

55:50.800 --> 55:55.800
technologies related to the system of payments,

55:55.800 --> 55:59.800
that is, the management of rewards,

55:59.800 --> 56:03.800
and training of staff attestation

56:03.800 --> 56:05.800
are used first.

56:05.800 --> 56:09.800
And finally, at the stage of the crisis,

56:10.800 --> 56:12.800
the reward system

56:12.800 --> 56:16.800
and the rule of dismissal of staff are used.

56:16.800 --> 56:19.800
But we return to the connection

56:19.800 --> 56:22.800
between business strategy

56:22.800 --> 56:27.800
and the functional strategy of managing human resources.

56:27.800 --> 56:30.800
Depending on which business strategy

56:30.800 --> 56:34.800
the company chooses to implement,

56:34.800 --> 56:40.800
we say that different functions of human staff management

56:40.800 --> 56:45.800
will imply a different set of events

56:45.800 --> 56:48.800
and a different tool.

56:48.800 --> 56:53.800
In particular, we will start with the classification of strategies,

56:53.800 --> 56:55.800
business strategies,

56:55.800 --> 56:58.800
which Michael Porter proposed.

56:58.800 --> 57:02.800
Let's assume that the company implements an innovation strategy.

57:02.800 --> 57:06.800
This means the achievement of competitive advantage through innovation.

57:06.800 --> 57:10.800
This means that it has already reached the stage of cooperation.

57:10.800 --> 57:12.800
For example,

57:12.800 --> 57:17.800
a company engaged in colored metals

57:17.800 --> 57:22.800
is a company that has already been in cooperation

57:22.800 --> 57:26.800
with a company that has already been in cooperation

57:27.800 --> 57:32.800
with a fairly large network of dealers.

57:32.800 --> 57:36.800
They reach the stage of development

57:36.800 --> 57:41.800
when they need to implement innovations,

57:41.800 --> 57:44.800
and only at this point

57:44.800 --> 57:49.800
they are able to seize some more part of the market.

57:49.800 --> 57:52.800
In principle, a fairly large company

57:52.800 --> 57:56.800
occupies about 35% of the market today.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.800
What is proposed?

57:58.800 --> 58:04.800
The company is proposed to introduce a so-called project office

58:04.800 --> 58:09.800
so that any employee can propose a project

58:09.800 --> 58:12.800
or the idea of the project,

58:12.800 --> 58:14.800
which would be interesting for the company,

58:14.800 --> 58:19.800
which could develop the company in the future.

58:19.800 --> 58:25.800
What is the function of human resources management?

58:25.800 --> 58:28.800
In terms of resource provision,

58:28.800 --> 58:32.800
we must recruit and retain staff

58:32.800 --> 58:37.800
who are inclined to innovations.

58:37.800 --> 58:40.800
This means highly qualified employees

58:40.800 --> 58:44.800
who have a rich enough experience of working in this area.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.800
This is a certain technology of hiring.

58:47.800 --> 58:50.800
When we talk about resource development,

58:50.800 --> 58:53.800
we must develop people's strategic abilities,

58:53.800 --> 58:58.800
we must increase their opportunities in the innovative sphere,

58:58.800 --> 59:03.800
we must increase the intellectual capital of the company.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.800
This means we must introduce a knowledge management system.

59:06.800 --> 59:08.800
In the area of reward,

59:08.800 --> 59:12.800
we must provide some financial incentives

59:12.800 --> 59:21.800
for employees to participate in innovative activities.

59:21.800 --> 59:24.800
In addition to financial incentives,

59:24.800 --> 59:26.800
in addition to monetary motivation,

59:26.800 --> 59:30.800
non-monetary motivation must be implemented.

59:30.800 --> 59:33.800
A simple thank you from the manager

59:33.800 --> 59:37.800
is a huge incentive for any person.

59:37.800 --> 59:40.800
This means that I am valued here,

59:40.800 --> 59:42.800
I am needed by this company.

59:42.800 --> 59:45.800
If we talk about another type of strategy,

59:45.800 --> 59:47.800
which was allocated by Michael Porter,

59:47.800 --> 59:51.800
the achievement of competitive advantage through quality improvement,

59:51.800 --> 01:00:00.800
then other tasks of human resources management will be pursued here.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.800
An example of such a strategy can be given

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.800
based on the experience of introducing a quality management system.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.800
When is it done?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.800
It is done at the stage of conquering new markets,

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.800
which are already well divided,

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.800
and, in principle, it is necessary to be different from other companies,

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.800
which are presented on this market.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.800
And this means differentiation,

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.800
differentiation, including in the area of quality.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.800
On the other hand,

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.800
as a rule, the quality systems are occupied by companies,

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.800
which are going to enter the Western market.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.800
Everything is fine with competition there.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.800
One of the companies that I would like to give as an example

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.800
is a company engaged in the production of packaging.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.800
Anyone can make packaging.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.800
And packaging is actually presented with quite strict quality requirements.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:06.800
A company operating in the regional market,

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.800
in the Russian regional market,

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.800
introduces a quality system,

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.800
trying to be in a more advantageous position

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.800
compared to others,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.800
including companies that came from St. Petersburg and Moscow.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:33.800
What is the task of the head of staff?

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.800
In terms of resource provision,

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.800
such personnel selection procedures should be used,

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.800
which could identify employees

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:53.800
providing the most likely quality of production in the process of work.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.800
In terms of resources, their development,

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.800
it is necessary for the organization to become self-educating.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.800
It is necessary for the company to have a mentoring system.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.800
A special emphasis should be placed on professional training

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.800
within the framework of the concept of quality management.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.800
It is necessary to train customer orientation.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.800
One study was conducted on customer orientation.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.800
Among banks, we took a lot of corporate culture of Western companies.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:43.800
Offices, dress code, but we did not take the most important thing.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.800
Customer orientation.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.800
When you call a bank and you may not receive an answer to your question.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.800
When you come and stand in line.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.800
When you address and understand that you are addressing in vain.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.800
When you make a request and get an answer,

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.800
you need it today.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.800
Let's say, in a week, if they remember.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.800
And if they do not remember, then only after the reminder,

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.800
and a week later.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.800
It is clear that in this case,

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.800
it is not necessary to talk about the quality of service.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.800
As it is not paradoxical,

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.800
the study conducted showed this.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.800
I mean our banking sphere.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.800
In the area of ​​rewards,

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.800
it is necessary to agree on rewards and quality indicators.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.800
The system of quality management, including ISO,

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:50.800
assumes that each process will be allocated several quality indicators.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.800
And of course, they can be taken into account in the labor payment system.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.800
Let's move on to the next strategy.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.800
Leadership in costs.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.800
This is a fairly characteristic strategy for most large companies,

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.800
especially in mass production.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.800
Here, competitive advantage is achieved through the optimization of costs.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.800
In fact, through an attempt to minimize them.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.800
And here, the main thing, again,

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.800
is that the functional strategy of managing human resources

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.800
does not contradict the one that is declared as a business strategy.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.800
I will give an example.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.800
The telecommunications monopolist of the Russian market.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.800
We will not name his name.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.800
Everyone has already guessed.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.800
He is going to lead in costs

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.800
and, accordingly, tries to minimize them.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.800
A decision is made on a significant reduction in costs.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.800
A decision is made on the automation of many processes.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.800
Super good.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.800
However, in order to automate something,

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.800
you need to create a service that will serve the IT system

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.800
that is engaged in the automation of processes.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.800
Great.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.800
But these are people.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.800
As a result, the company,

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.800
the unit created when the IT system is introduced,

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.800
grabs the head,

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.800
because there is a strategy of reducing the number.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.800
One of the events is implemented.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.800
The second event is the opposite of the implementation of the IT system

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800
that requires people.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.800
There is a conflict.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.800
A conflict between the units inside this company.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.800
But the solution was found.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.800
Consultants were invited,

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:52.800
who began to try to justify the number, its increase.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.800
As a result, both goals were achieved in some way.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.800
But they were contradictory.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.800
What is the task of HR service?

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.800
In the area of resource provision,

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.800
we must select the staff in the cheapest way.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.800
This means that we select it in the center,

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.800
where the managing company is located,

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.800
and in the regions.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.800
In the regions, we know that they are cheaper.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.800
On the other hand,

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.800
we must try to find employees on the market

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.800
with a high added value.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.800
We must plan and carry out a reduction of staff.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.800
In fact, we must plan human resources.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.800
This means that we must understand who we need to hire,

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:46.800
how many people will leave the production process

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.800
due to dismissals, due to other reasons.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.800
And finally, we must understand the reasons

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.800
why we acquire or lose staff.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.800
In the area of resource development,

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.800
we must carry out training

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.800
aimed at increasing the productivity of the labor,

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.800
on the effectiveness and effectiveness of the labor.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.800
In the area of reward,

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.800
we must ensure the value of invested funds.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.800
Therefore, we must optimize unnecessary costs,

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.800
we must introduce an efficiency management system,

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.800
either a system for goal management

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.800
or a system for performance management.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:41.800
The next type of business strategy

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.800
is the strategy of buying heads.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.800
We buy a ready team.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:53.800
Therefore, we save on preparing staff,

01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:00.800
but we must invest in maintaining this team

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.800
to get the added value that they can bring to us.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.800
Resources provision.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.800
The selection procedure will be difficult,

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.800
because we need to find the team,

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.800
persuade the team that is ready to move on.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.800
In the area of resource development,

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.800
self-training is necessary.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:30.800
This can be done through assessment,

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.800
building a competence model,

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.800
and, based on this, building personal development plans.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.800
This is a mentorship system.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.800
We inform the company's involvement and commitment

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.800
on behalf of the team that we have bought.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.800
In the area of reward,

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:54.800
we must introduce performance management

01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:00.800
and ensure competitive salary,

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.800
not lower than market.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.800
This is often assumed by grading.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.800
As an example, we can give a situation

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:20.800
of buying a team of managers of the Ashan trading network

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.800
with a cross-stitching X5 Retail,

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:34.800
or buying a team of managers from Eldorado in Technosil.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.800
Another example is a consulting company BDO Unicorn,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:45.800
which lost a large percentage of its high-class team

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.800
due to the fact that another company,

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:58.800
which decided to implement consultative services,

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.800
CompuLink, bought the team.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.800
Here we need to say that it is possible to buy a team.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.800
We all cost something.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.800
Someone more, someone less.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.800
Here we need to say that the team,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.800
which has passed once,

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.800
must be kept.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.800
We have encountered cases on the market

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.800
when such a transition is carried out by the team annually

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.800
in order to raise bonuses.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:36.800
In any case, there are a number of goals before the HR service.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.800
Improve performance,

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.800
expand the base of professional skills,

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.800
ensure the development of competence,

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.800
career growth.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.800
There are 6 such goals.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.800
These goals are presented in your support consulting.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:05.800
Each goal is considered through a set of functional measures.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.800
Functional measures are allocated,

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.800
providing resources,

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.800
development of human resources and rewards.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.800
Accordingly, in each of the presented sets of measures

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:31.800
we track the horizontal and vertical integration.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.800
Let's move on to the next topic.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.800
Evaluation of the efficiency of the HR system.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.800
For the owner, as I said at the very beginning,

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.800
it is very important to increase the value of the business.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.800
And it would be good to speak his language with the owner.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.800
That is, with financial categories.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.800
It is easier for the owner to understand these categories.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.800
To do this, new methods are introduced

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.800
in the system of assessment of the efficiency of the HR system.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:37.800
One of these methods is the use of ROI methodology.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.800
ROI is the financial indicator of return on investment.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.800
From the perspective of this methodology,

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.800
it is necessary to assess the reaction of participants and the planned actions.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.800
Here we measure the level of satisfaction with programs

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.800
and the level of performance for planned actions.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.800
Next is training.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.800
We measure training in the changes that occurred

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.800
with the listener in knowledge, skills, and settings.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.800
Then the application.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.800
We measure changes in behavior at work.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.800
And finally, the impact on business and return on investment.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800
Impact on business.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.800
We measure changes in business indicators.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.800
Here we use indicators that are used

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:35.800
to assess the achievement of the business goal.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.800
Return on investment.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.800
We compare the benefits of a particular program project

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.800
with the costs of this program.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.800
In principle, the methodology is very simple, very convenient.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.800
And it looks like this in practice.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:59.800
We introduce a new stimulation system.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.800
We introduce a career development system.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.800
Accordingly, we reduce the flow of staff.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:19.800
In addition, we also have a program for training employees and mentors.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:24.800
Consequently, we increase the qualification, competence,

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.800
and performance of the employees' work.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.800
All this is non-material assets,

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.800
and in principle, non-material assets can be assessed.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.800
We look at what happens to our company

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.800
after a certain period of time.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.800
Let's say, in a year.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.800
We say that our programs, which we implemented,

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.800
gave us the opportunity to achieve growth in income.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.800
Through the fact that we have improved our system,

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:00.800
through the fact that we can now make more perfect decisions,

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:08.800
the internal consumer is more satisfied with the activity of the staff management service.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.800
All this is a material asset.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.800
Consequently, we assess the income we received in a year

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.800
with the investments we invested in at the beginning.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.800
That is, from the attitude of income to investments.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.800
With this indicator, we can go to the owner and say,

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.800
here are the profits from our programs.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.800
Everything would be fine.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.800
And the owner will definitely like this indicator.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.800
But it is difficult to assess it in fact.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:48.800
It is especially difficult to assess it for the practice of human resources management.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.800
This is a non-material asset.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.800
A non-material asset means that there are difficulties in the assessment.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.800
This is a separate big topic, which you will certainly consider.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.800
Such an assessment gives a very big error.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800
But this is not all.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.800
You can also accept the error.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.800
Imagine that in addition to these projects,

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.800
there are a number of projects in the company,

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.800
which are also aimed at changing non-material assets.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.800
The CRM is being implemented.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:28.800
Another program is being implemented.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.800
At the same time, we understand that in fact,

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.800
there are two or three programs, and everything else is money thrown into the air.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.800
And this is impossible to track.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.800
We cannot distinguish the influence of a particular program

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.800
on the development of a career,

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.800
how it affected the income,

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.800
what percentage it made.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.800
As a result, the error increases.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:17:00.800
And we understand that we need to move not only to such financial indicators.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:09.800
According to Dave Ulrich and other leading economists in the field of strategic management,

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.800
the efficiency of the staff management system can be measured

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.800
in the same way as we assess the activities of a non-commercial organization.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.800
By the binary principle.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.800
Did it? Did not do it.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800
Did it?

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.800
Built a corporate university.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.800
Did it?

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.800
Did a mentoring system.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.800
Did it?

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.800
Conducted 5 trainings.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.800
Did it?

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.800
Well, if you did not conduct, did not adapt, did not implement,

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.800
did not implement the adaptation system or did not do anything else,

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.800
then the error is bad.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:56.800
Then we can use the tool of implementation of the strategy,

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.800
for example, associated with the indicators of efficiency of the KPI.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:08.800
In this case, we need to take a strategic map

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.800
made for the company,

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:21.800
look at the goals that are designated for the company as a whole

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.800
and allocated to a separate perspective of the staff,

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:33.800
and try to further decompose them

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:38.800
so that the separate specialists of the staff management service

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.800
can take these goals on themselves.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:47.800
That is, if we have a goal marked in front of the department,

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.800
then now we bring this goal to each structure of our department,

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.800
and then to each employee of the department.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.800
For example, look at the strategic map of HR,

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.800
developed for a credit organization.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.800
You have it in the support conspectus and here.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.800
This is a map with a decomposition

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.800
for the staff management department.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.800
So, we took a few other perspectives

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.800
than the standard ones offered by Norton and Kaplan.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.800
We are developing for the department.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.800
So, we have the perspectives of the owners and shareholders.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.800
Of course, they are interested in the financial sphere,

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:45.800
so here we allocate tasks related to increasing the company's income

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.800
and maximizing the ROI for the staff.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:54.800
On the other hand, we have the perspectives of internal processes,

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.800
which the staff management service should deal with.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:04.800
We have the perspectives of development and growth.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.800
In these perspectives, we reflect the goals and tasks

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.800
that are in front of our department.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.800
We have one common goal, and we decompose it into smaller ones.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:23.800
We take one of them and try to add efficiency indicators

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:31.800
for each goal, which we can use to evaluate its implementation.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:37.800
For example, let's take the goal of maintaining the staff,

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:42.800
which we have set for our department.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:49.800
We can measure the achievement of this goal with various indicators.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.800
I will give you a few examples.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.800
For example, the costs for the liquidity,

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.800
or the liquidity of the staff in a certain category of positions,

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:03.800
or the coefficient of retention of critically important employees.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:13.800
These can also be indicators that we take with the help of surveyors and surveys.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:22.800
For example, the results of the survey show how good the company is

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.800
as an employer from the employees' point of view.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.800
How do they evaluate it?

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:36.800
Of course, every indicator that we track should be calculated.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.800
For example, the costs for the liquidity.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.800
We calculate the costs for the selection of new employees

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:48.800
and their level of competence, plus the lost benefit

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:53.800
from the fact that this or that initiative cannot be implemented

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:57.800
due to the fact that the one who could implement it simply left the company.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:06.800
There is another model that allows us to measure the level of efficiency

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.800
and efficiency of the company.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.800
The staff management service.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.800
It is called the 6C model.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.800
In accordance with the first letters,

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:28.800
there are 6 words that denote the directions in which the measurement should be made.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:39.800
These are the blocks that can be entered into the staff management service's indicators.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.800
First, and this is probably the most important thing,

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.800
the level of efficiency of the HR.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.800
The level of consciousness, the satisfaction of internal customers,

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.800
in the first place, we are talking about linear managers,

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:58.800
corporate culture, control of costs, and contribution to the improvement of business indicators.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.800
This 6C model can be presented in the form of a pyramid.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.800
We are all fond of pyramids, as well as managers.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.800
This is the pyramid of HR efficiency.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.800
It is an analogue of the Maslow pyramid, the pyramid of needs.

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:20.800
At the bottom, there is physiology, which is necessary in any case.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:28.800
At the top, there is what you should strive for and what is achieved only if we have a basis,

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.800
if the previous level has been reached.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.800
So, the basis of the pyramid is the compliance with the legislation.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:46.800
Next, processes and their optimization from the point of view of cost control and quality assurance.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:58.800
Next, business indicators and, finally, strategic goals and compliance with the policy that the HR service implements.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.800
These are the strategic goals.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:07.800
Thus, we can compile all the indicators of the efficiency of the HR service in blocks.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:17.800
Organizational, quality of services of the HR service, behavior of employees and achievement of goals.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.800
Let's take a closer look at each of these blocks.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:29.800
The indicators of the efficiency of the HR service are related to the organizational block.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:39.800
It can include the added cost per employee, the profit per employee, the volume of sales per employee, the costs per employee, and so on.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:50.800
In principle, these are indicators that bear a soulful character, determining the optimal number of staff.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:59.800
The next block is related to the assessment of the level of services of the HR service.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:11.800
It includes the average time of filling out the vacancies, the time of answering the question from one of the departments,

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:17.800
the costs for advertising about the set compared to the number of contracts.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:25.800
The next block is related to the formation of a certain behavior of the employees.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:36.800
This block can be attributed to the costs saved as a result of the proposals created using the procedures developed by the HR service.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.800
The development group or project groups.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:47.800
It can be the number of appeals to court, for example, on the issue of dismissal.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.800
It can be the number of non-workings.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:06.800
We assess in quantitative ways the level of behavior that we would like to achieve in our company.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.800
Here, by the way, can be an indicator of the number of fines imposed.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:17.800
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that according to Russian legislation, there can be no fines.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:26.800
The next block is related to the achievement of the goal.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:33.800
If we have taken on a task, then we must fulfill the established deadlines.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.800
This can serve as an indicator of the effectiveness of the goal.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.800
Satisfaction.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.800
Evaluation of internal customer feedback.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:55.800
Conducting surveys related to the work indicators and the formation of adherence to the indicators.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.800
The results of the attestation.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:03.800
For example, the number of appeals that we had to remove according to the results of the attestation.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:13.800
All this can serve as an indicator of the effectiveness of the goals set before the staff management service.

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:23.800
The goal of the staff management service is to ensure that the employees are satisfied with the results of the work.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.800
The goal of the staff management service is to ensure that the employees are satisfied with the results of the work.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:42.800
Thus, colleagues, we have considered the introductory part of the course on human resources management.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:51.800
I ask you to fill out the form provided in your support consulting, answering the questions provided at the end of the text.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.800
Thank you very much for your attention.
