00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Dear colleagues, I hope that you have successfully completed the tasks from the workbook for the second part.

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
And I suggest that we move on to the third part of our course, namely the methodology of assessing personnel.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
I would like to warn you that by the end of this part you will know a lot about the assessment of personnel.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Therefore, the third part of the workbook contains rather complex tasks.

00:38.000 --> 00:47.000
You will not only have to answer the questions of a test-like nature and choose the correct answer from several given options.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
You will have to apply all the knowledge you will receive by that time to answer the questions.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Therefore, I recommend that you be very attentive.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
So, the methodologies and technologies.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
When using different technologies of assessing personnel, those that we have considered,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
different private specific methods can be used.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I would divide them into three groups.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
The first is the methodology of assessing the work of a person.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
The second is the methodology of assessing the knowledge of qualifications and competences.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
And the third is the quantitative assessment of the quality indicators of behavior.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
The last one is probably the most complex, but I think we will figure it out.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Let's start with the methodology of assessing the work of a person.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
Let's start with the fact that there are four principles according to which we can assess the work.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
And violation of these principles usually leads to failure in our entire assessment of personnel.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
So, the first one.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
We have to choose the correct indicators.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And it is very easy to choose the wrong ones.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
We will see later which indicators are correct and which are not.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
When choosing indicators, we should also keep in mind that they can be absolute or relative.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
The absolute one is, for example, 648 something.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
A kilogram, a thousand dollars, kilometers of the path.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And it can be relative.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
For example, 15% of something.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
From the plan, or from what the unit has done in general, or from what the best worker of the unit does.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It is not so important.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
In fact, we should well imagine that in some cases absolute indicators are important for us, and in others relative.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
We will deal with this a little later.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
The second important point is the choice of representative intervals of time.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Tell me, please, is it possible to assess the work of a manager,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
under the leadership of which there are 8 people, in one day?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm afraid it's difficult, right?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
And in two days?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And in a month?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
And in a quarter?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And in a year?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
In short, there are such intervals of time,

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
during which we have criteria to assess the work as the best or the worst.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
At larger intervals of time it doesn't make sense.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
At smaller intervals of time we simply won't see what's going on.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
The third, the analysis of the dynamics of human work over time is extremely important.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
We have already talked a little about this.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
It is very important for us to understand not only how he is now,

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
but whether his indicators are improving or deteriorating, or remain the same.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
This is one of the goals of our assessment,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
to predict what a person will do next,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
and to do this we need to understand in which direction the trend is developing.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
And finally, an extremely important point is the account of the influence of so-called external factors,

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
that is, those factors that can be assessed, their influence can be seen,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
but they do not reflect the indicators of human work in any way,

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
and do not give us any special grounds to assess this work in a positive or negative direction.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
How can we choose the indicators that will be correct?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
The indicators must correspond to the nature of human work,

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
that is, they must reflect exactly what we can assess as a good or bad worker, or average,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
and not something else.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
The second point is that the indicators for different jobs, for different workers,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
must be comparable to each other.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
If we measure the indicators for one worker in one unit,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
for another in a completely different one,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
and we cannot compare them with each other,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
how can we measure the effectiveness and assess the work?

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
In other words, the method of comparison must be provided.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
The third point is the reflection of the capabilities of the worker himself.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
What do I mean?

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
We must assess the indicators that reflect what a person is able to influence.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
If he is not able to influence, then, I'm sorry,

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
we will hardly get anything correct and can judge his work.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Let's imagine a very simple example.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Let's say we have two shopping centers that sell cell phones.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
But one of these shopping centers is located somewhere far away,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
on the periphery, in the back yards of a small residential block,

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
and the other is located near the subway, where a large number of people pass.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Which one do you think will bring more profit?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Obviously, the second one.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's just better located.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Can this serve as an indicator of the quality of the work of the employees?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
No way.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
The next question that often raises doubts,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
and which is also quite intriguing,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
as is the case with most of the issues related to the assessment of the staff,

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
is the correspondence of indicators that we use in the interests of the enterprise.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
You may ask, how can the indicators of the work not correspond to the interests of the enterprise?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's very simple.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
We want the employee in the shopping center to bring as much profit as possible to the enterprise.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
And therefore, as the main indicator of his work,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
we set the sales volume,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
how much money he sold for a certain time,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
for example, in a week or a month.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
What do we get as a result?

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
All our managers of the shopping center will run after those buyers

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
who want to buy a refrigerator, or a TV, or a computer,

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
but they are absolutely not interested in those visitors who want to buy a mouse for a vacuum cleaner,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
or something cheap.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
They will run after such buyers,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
not pay attention to them,

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
excuse me for the expression, but will not go to our store.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Does this behavior of the seller correspond to the interests of our company?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Of course, it does not.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Why is it so?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
And we have created such an indicator.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
So, every time we have to set such indicators of work

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
that would meet the interests of our company as a whole.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
In brackets, I note that the KPI system is optimal for this,

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
but we remember that its application is associated with certain difficulties.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
And finally, there is such a criterion as reasonable sufficiency.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
What does it mean?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
People with an engineering and technical approach usually think

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
that the more different indicators we introduce,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
the more accurately we will evaluate the work of a person.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
This is not so.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
As you know, there is a magic number 7 plus minus 2.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
This is the volume of human attention,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
the volume of short-term memory,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and the so-called control norm.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Due to its psychological features,

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
a person is not able to evaluate and control more than 5, 7 plus minus 2 objects.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
If we introduce an evaluation system of 15, 20, 30 indicators,

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
it means that we cannot say anything special about these indicators.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Although we have evaluated everything from all sides,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
it turns out that some indicators are worse than others,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
according to the law of large numbers.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And what happens as a result?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
All our employees are about the same.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
So, we need to introduce only those key indicators

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
that really allow us to say whether a person works well or not.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
We are not interested in all other indicators.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
And we do not need to multiply super-measures.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
To better understand what has just been said,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
let's look at two examples.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Example number 1.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Imagine a woman who works as a cashier,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
and now they are called the owners of the cash register,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
in a huge supermarket.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
So, customers come to her with their carts full of goods.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
And we have a task to ensure career growth,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
to select the best,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
to make the system of labor payment transparent and tied to the results,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
and to evaluate the work of these cash registers.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
What indicators can we choose for this?

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
Let's take such an indicator as the number of serviced customers.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
What does it reflect?

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
It seems to reflect the work of our cash register owner.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
But imagine that one of them missed 50 customers,

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
each of whom had matches and a bottle of kefir in his cart.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And the second one missed only 5 people,

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
but they had overloaded carts full of goods.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
And each of these customers brought us a profit,

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
let's say, 300 times more than the number of matches, matches and kefir.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Then a good indicator would be the volume of revenue

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
that passes through the cash register.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
But again, it doesn't work.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
It's very simple.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
How do you think, will a cash register owner influence

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
how much and what goods a particular customer will put in his cart?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
No.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
He will sit at the cash register,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
he is not a merchandiser,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
he does not advertise any goods,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
he just checks.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
So, these indicators cannot reflect the quality of his work,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
simply because it does not affect them in any way.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Let's remember the principle of the correlation of the indicators of work

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
and the capabilities of our worker.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
In many cases, in such stores,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
in such large supermarkets,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
there are advertising promotions.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Certain goods are promoted,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
these goods become priority,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
suppliers want to sell more of them.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Maybe this is a new product,

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
maybe this is a propaganda and development of the store's sales brand.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So, there is such a thing as a priority product,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
the one that would be good to be sold more.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Can we assess the work of our cash register

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
through the quantity or quality of the sold priority goods?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
No.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
It will not run around the shopping mall.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
The maximum it can do is to check,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
to be interested or to offer to buy a particular product.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
But then we will complicate its work.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
We will have queues,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
and this is good,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
no, this is bad,

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
we do not like it.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
This will cause indignation of the customers.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
So, three indicators that seem to be very good

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and reflect the work of cash registers

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
are not really suitable for our criteria.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And what is suitable?

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
It turns out that there are only two indicators.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
The first is the number of released or scanned goods per unit of time.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
One cash registerer scans 3,000 goods per shift,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
and the other, let's say, 15,000.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
This means that one cash register works very fast,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
performs its function,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
therefore, it quickly lets the buyers through,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
it does not create queues.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
This is a good indicator.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
This is a much better indicator

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
than the number of missed buyers,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
which our cash register does not affect,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
or the indicator of the volume of the proceeds through the cash register,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
which it also does not affect.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
It affects only one thing.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
How many times does it scan goods per unit of time?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Is this enough? No, it is not.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Because it is also very important for us

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
how many mistakes it makes.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
How many times does it ask the senior cash registerer

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
to come to it with a key and scan a check?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Because it has missed twice,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
missed, missed again,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
it starts a gentle and affectionate conversation with the buyer,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
who is tired of all this.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
This means that this number of mistakes should also be taken into account.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
These are two indicators that more or less correspond to our criteria.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Agree, they are slightly less obvious

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
than the indicators that we considered as incorrect.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Now, let's go to the shopping hall of our store.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
Let's assume that we are going to implement

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
a fairly complex household appliance,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
electrical appliances,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
fridges, TVs,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
video cameras, and so on.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And in our hall there are managers

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
who have to work with the buyer,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
explain what he buys,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
why he buys it,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
why it is so expensive,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
recommend, show, and so on.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
This is its function.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
We want this from the manager in the shopping hall.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Or a sales consultant, as they are also called.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
Let's try to introduce two indicators into their work.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
The first one is the number of goods that they have missed.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
For example, he missed 30 units during the shift.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
This is better than if he missed 10 units.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Three times.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
And we are also very interested in the volume of his sales.

14:43.000 --> 14:51.000
The one who missed goods for, let's say, 500,000 rubles

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
is, of course, five times better than the one who missed 100,000 rubles.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
These are good indicators.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
At first glance, it seems that they are quite relevant

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
and meet our tasks, and so on.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
But let's see.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
The number of goods and the volume of sales

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
are they only dependent on the work of our respected consultant?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
No.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
They depend on where our shopping mall is located.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
How popular is the brand of your store?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
How well-known is it?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
How convenient is its location?

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
In the end, it depends on the time of year.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Is it before the New Year, when everyone runs to buy gifts?

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
Or after the New Year, when we experience the consequences

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
of what we bought and used during the New Year holidays?

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
These are two indicators that somehow reflect the work of our sales consultant

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
or manager of the shopping mall.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
But it may turn out that these indicators work against us.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
That is, the principle of compliance with the interests of our enterprise is violated.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Let's say we set our consultant's work evaluation criteria

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
as the volume of sales.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
That is, how many rubles did he sell in two shifts per week?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
An interesting question.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
As soon as we do this, our respected consultants will start running

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
after buyers who want to buy expensive goods

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
and ignore those who want to buy something cheap.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
There are many such examples.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Thus, we stimulate the behavior of our employees

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
so that they work against the interests of our enterprise.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
What indicators can be correct?

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
First, we will have to introduce such a useful and very important thing as standards,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
that is, plans.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Plans can be set in different ways,

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
but it is best to set them based on the specifics of the location

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
and other characteristics of our given shopping mall.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
If we evaluate the enterprises in a favorable or unfavorable zone

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
based on the same indicators,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
or if some other factors influence them,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
most likely some of them will be bad all the time,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and others will be good all the time.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Let's make it easier.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Let's set different plans.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
We will evaluate a person based on whether he has fulfilled this plan or not.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
In addition, we will remember the principle of compliance with human capabilities.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
If one of our sales consultants is a beginner and has only been working for a month,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
and the other is an old Zubr who has been here for 4 years and knows everything perfectly,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
and knows everything perfectly,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and has passed training, and so on,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
then, of course, the second one will be more effective.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
So we need to set a different plan.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But we will notice that the reward system is also important.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
What about the sales of priority goods?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
When we discussed the owner of the cash register or cashier,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
we found out that she does not influence these sales in any special way.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
And the consultant is in his hands.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
He can advise to buy a brand that is not very well known,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
not very popular yet.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
He can explain why this particular product is worth buying,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
what are its consumer properties.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
He can talk to our customer clearly.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
So this criterion will also be correct for him.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Speaking about the work of a sales consultant in a trading room,

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
we have touched on the question of how long it should be to evaluate his work.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
For a shift, for a week, for a month.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
It seems to me that it is quite difficult to evaluate during a shift.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
It is such a small interval for assessment.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Now we will look at an example that clearly shows

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
how to choose a representative interval for assessment.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Let's take a sales manager,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
but he does not work in a supermarket,

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
but in a company or a company in a trading house.

18:56.000 --> 19:04.000
He sells industrial goods, food, clothing, TNP in large quantities.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
He can sell it to end consumers,

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
to production enterprises that use this product for their own production.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Or he can sell it to small wholesalers or retailers.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
We will not even consider what criteria we evaluate its effectiveness.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Let's take the simplest one, we will not evaluate how long it is now,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
whether it is suitable for this case or not.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
This is the volume of sales.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
How much, for what amount did our sales manager sell the product in a single hour?

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
On the graph, you can see the dynamics of its sales per month.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
Agree that the curve is quite uneven.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
In January, he did much less than in February,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
this is understandable, everyone is resting in January.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
In March, for some reason, he did a little less,

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
and then he jumped again, and in April there was a drop again,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
but in May there was a lot.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
We will not even consider whether it works well or not,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
and what is the dynamics of its sales over time.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
If we try to evaluate sales not in months, but in quarters,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
we will see a much smoother curve.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
It is clear that the overall trend is up.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
The rest is possible due to the effects of some external factors,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
such as seasonal factors or some other factors.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
Let's consider separately the value of the dynamics of the growth of indicators

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
for the assessment of the work of our employee.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
As an example, let's take our favorite sales managers again.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Let it be, as in the previous example,

20:41.000 --> 20:47.000
managers for large, medium or small-scale sales of a small company.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
What they sell is not very important to us.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
In this case, we will take an indicator that is not absolute, but relative.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
That is, the percentage of the sales of the entire department in a certain period,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
let it be a year.

21:01.000 --> 21:09.000
Look, Mr. Balaganov sold only 3% of the total sales volume.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
It turns out that this is very little.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
Kozlevich, Panikovsky and Polyhaev, 5-7%,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
it seems better, but also bad.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
Here we notice that it is necessary to take into account how much time they worked.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
If Balaganov works for 2 months, then he sold so little.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
It means that our percentage should be reduced to the interval of time.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Maybe average by month.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Bender, Berlag and Vorobyaninov have a better case.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Such a line, 8-12%.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
We have two heroes, Mrs. Gritsatsueva and Mr. Koreiko.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
Gritsatsueva 20%, and Koreiko is the hero of our time, 30%.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Well done.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Can we, based on this graph,

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
taking into account the duration of our managers' work in this department,

22:05.000 --> 22:13.000
judge who works better, who works worse, and what are their indicators.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Let's look at the next graph.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Example 4.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Now let's look at the quarters and the year of our indicator.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Look what's going on.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
Berlag was average, but he has a constant drop from the first to the fourth quarter.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
What does this mean?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Something is wrong with this person.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
His indicators are decreasing.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
And here we have comrade Bender.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Look, in the first quarter, almost nothing, then higher, higher, higher.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
And by the end of the year, his indicators significantly overlap the indicators of the same Berlag.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Here we have a clear tendency to growth.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
A completely different assessment of a person's work.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
And here is Mrs. Gritsatsueva, who was highly rated by us,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
if you remember, she is the second in the rating.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
She is somewhere in the middle, so she is hanging around the indicators,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
neither higher nor lower.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
And here I will ask a question.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Why does Gritsatsueva have 20% sales per unit?

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
She is such a good seller, she knows how to work so well.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
What is it connected with?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
The answer was very simple.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Do you know the name of the head of the sales department?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
If you don't, I'll tell you, Gritsatsuev.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
Here we have a vivid example of how external factors,

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
not taken into account by us, can affect the indicators of a particular worker.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I took this example, I did not invent it, I took it from life.

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
Summing up the work assessment, I would like to add one more very significant detail.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
All workers can be divided into two categories.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
The first category is people who produce a certain,

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
calculated, subject to a certain number of assessments, result.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Well, it is clear that the one who has the best result is the best,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
and the one who has the worst is probably not so good.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
There are people who do not produce such a result.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
For example, what is the task of our dear cashier?

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
It is to check checks and not to make mistakes.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
These are people whose task is not to produce results,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
but to carry out a certain production process,

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
without making any violations, mistakes,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
and without going beyond the framework of the company's requirements,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
at the enterprise, standards, rules, and so on.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Probably one of the most vivid examples is accounting.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Finally, there are people who are responsible for the work of the units,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
the departments, and the management staff.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And when assessing them, the most important thing is, of course,

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
the results of the work of the departments or departments they head.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
If we return to the first two categories,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
the category of people who produce results,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
for example, our dear manager of the trading room,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
and people who carry out processes,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
for example, accounting,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
then the question is often raised,

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
how to assess these people who do not produce any tangible result,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
but simply carry out a process.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
In this regard, I would like to tell you an old story about the wise king Solomon,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
who, as you know, paid his doctor when he was healthy,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
but did not pay when he was sick.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
It is clear that if he paid when he was sick, he would be sick all the time.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
From here, the moral.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
If you want to introduce a system of assessment of workers who carry out a process,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
and they require the correct execution of the process,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
then consider those who do it correctly good,

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
and those who do it wrong and violate it, not good.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
Let's move on to the questions of assessment of knowledge, qualifications and competencies.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
There are several questions that need to be addressed at once.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
These are questions about who assesses,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
we talked a little about this.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
These are the managers, self-assessment, expert assessment,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
and assessment by a certain group of colleagues, subordinates,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
external and internal clients of our assessment,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
and the question is how to assess the work of the managers.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
What can be assessed?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
We talked about the behavior at work, the results of work.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
We just talked about it.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
In the case of expert assessment,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
the results of the implementation of practical exercises can be assessed,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
which somehow imitates the behavior of a person at work, in a working situation.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
But in addition there are tests, tasks, and so-called cases.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
This is another loan from the English language,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
which can be translated into Russian as a specific situation or a specific case.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Let's try to deal with the last three situations

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
and understand what it is, where and how it can be used.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Let's start with tests.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
How is the test arranged?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
The tests are arranged in a narrow range,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
so-called knowledge tests.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
They should be used to understand whether a person knows what he should know or not.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
The easiest way is to ask questions,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
to give several options for answers,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
who recommends three options, who recommends five options,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
one or several, usually one of which is correct, the rest are incorrect.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Let's take an example.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Suppose you want to know how much an HR employee

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
owns the positions of the Labor Code.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
And here is a test, where such a question appears.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Does the task assigned to an employee who is already working in an organization allow it?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Does it allow it, does it not, does it allow it in specific cases?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
In this situation, I do not ask you to answer this question.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
I hope you know the correct answer.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
The pathos here is that we can quickly, effectively and accurately assess the knowledge of something.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Technology, position, instructions, laws, textbooks,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
that is, some texts where you can know or not know.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
And a person shows his knowledge or not.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
The most prominent and well-known today is the United States exam,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
which we have recently conducted, which is based on this principle.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Who wrote it? Eugene Onegin, Pushkin, Tolstoy or Chekhov.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Is this enough?

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Not always.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
The fact is that we are not engaged in education,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
we are not an educational institution,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
and we do not always have the task of checking the knowledge of a person,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
well, of a certain text, let's say.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Does he know the position or not?

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
For us, it is often interesting whether he can apply these positions.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
The task is used for this.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
An example of such a task.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
In the same material that we have just discussed.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
You intend to assign a leadership position to an employee,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
but you are not sure that he will cope with it.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
How will you do it?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Appoint a trial period, appoint a temporary executive position,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
or simply appoint a position, and if unsuccessful, return it to the previous one.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
These are the three options for the answer.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
You need to show the knowledge of the fact that a person working in an organization,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
according to the labor code, cannot be subjected to a trial.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
You also need to understand how an italian article is applicable in this situation.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
The task is different in that there is a situation

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
where you need not just to show knowledge and find the right answer,

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
but to apply this knowledge to a specific situation.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
I want to say that in a number of situations,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
the task is not just to know the position,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
the position of a particular document,

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
instruction or rule,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
but to know several positions at once.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
In other words, there are situations where you need to remember

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
several different positions and combine them into one.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
For those who took the exam for a driver's license,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
this situation is very familiar.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
In the exam, there are pictures where you need to choose

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
who should give way to whom in this situation.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
Here, it often turns out that the knowledge of several positions is checked,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
and a person should apply them in this situation.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Is this enough?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
In general, it is good enough, there is a lot of it,

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
we already know how to check not only the knowledge, but also the possibility of their manifestation.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
But there are situations when a person is capable of pure logic,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
or of insufficient, but superficial knowledge,

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
to give the right answer in the choices he is offered.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
But in real life, it often turns out that there is no right answer.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
There are deliberately wrong,

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
and maybe several different right.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
It is in such situations that the CTA is often faced with,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
which the manager faces in his daily work.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
He has to take too many factors into account.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
The test or task assumes that its text contains sufficient information.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
And in a real working situation,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
we often have to face cases when we do not know what information we need,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
and whether this case is important or not.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Does this factor play a role?

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
And generally, as a rule, information is not enough.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And we have to make decisions in the context of a lack of information.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
In such situations, such a thing as cases are used for expert assessment.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
This is a description of a real situation, but usually without answers.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
A person must come up with an answer himself.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
And the expert commission decides to what extent this answer can be considered right,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
wrong, good or bad.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Often it turns out that the person is given an answer that no one has ever given before.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
And suddenly it turns out to be right.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
That this can also be done, and nothing terrible will happen,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
and the task will be solved.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
An example from our area.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
You intend to appoint a manager to a staff member,

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
but you are not sure that he will cope.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
How will you do it?

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
Thus, a person must not only know the position of the labor code,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
but also know how long he has been working in this organization,

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
what else we know about this person,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
what are his plans for life, what are our relations with him.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Here it is necessary to show a more complex thing,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
that is, managerial competencies.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Are all cases good?

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
And are they enough to check the assessment of what qualifications,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
what competencies the employee has?

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Unfortunately, this is not always the case.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Practice shows that theoretical solutions to tasks,

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
finding and inventing the right answer,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
or knowledge of the right answer,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
do not always show how a person will behave in a real situation.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
And then we use games,

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
imitation games, practical exercises,

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
situational tests,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
when we create a situation and ask a person to behave in this situation.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
How will it look in the situation we are considering?

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
You intend to assign an employee to a managerial position,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
but you are not sure that he will cope.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
So, have a conversation with him.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
The role of the employee is played by one of the members of the group with which you work,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
or you as a coach or an expert.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
And in this situation we will consider not only whether a person knows the laws, rules,

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
not only what decision he will make,

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
not only what he will do,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
but also how he will do it,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
what communicative skills he has,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
what verbal and non-verbal communication means he will use,

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
what arguments he will use,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
what he is in communication with.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
In this case, he must show himself.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
This is the most difficult, the most expensive

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
and the most dubious way of evaluating a person's qualifications.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
And this is the most difficult,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
simply because games and practical exercises

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
do not always correspond to the real cases

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
in which a person comes across in real life.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Nevertheless,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
of all the methods of evaluating competence,

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
this is the most advanced.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Although the difficulty of using it is that

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
you have to understand what is better and what is worse.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
And, of course, it is quite expensive.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
It takes a lot of time and requires a special qualification evaluator.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
It is not enough to just conduct this exercise,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
but also to see and understand what a person's deficit is.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
And it is also very important to show him himself

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
so that he sees that he has this deficit

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
and wants to overcome it.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
The last situation we discussed

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
when we evaluate a person's qualifications or competence

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
because he performs a practical task

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
already creates a certain difficulty.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
The evaluation of knowledge on tasks or tests

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
can be done using a key.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
There are correct and incorrect answers.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
We can simply calculate how many correct and incorrect answers

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
a person we evaluate has given.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
But how to evaluate correctness in a situation

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
when there is no such key

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
and the correct or incorrect answers are somewhat blurred?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
This is the topic of quantitative assessments of a person's performance.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
How can we evaluate the correctness or incorrectness of a case?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
For example, we can create a scale

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
from correct to incorrect,

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
say, a 5 or 10-point scale,

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
and ask our respected experts

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
to give our evaluated person such assessments.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
How can we do it in figure skating?

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
We can raise the score.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
The question is whether these assessments

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
will be objective or subjective

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
and what is the difference between 4 and 3,

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
and 3 and 2.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
It is clear that 2 is bad, 3 is average,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
and 4 is rather good.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
But let's recall a legend.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
A student can't know a subject more than 3 points.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Because he knows only the author of the textbook by 5 points,

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
and he can only know the answer by 4 points,

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
and the student can only know the answer by 3 points.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
We need to find a way

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
to make this assessment of behavior,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
of not having a quantitative assessment,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
a quantitative assessment.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Here we come to a new topic

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
that I would like to start with a small case.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Imagine that we created a list of certain qualities,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
for example, discipline, performance,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
attitude in the team,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
and a couple of other qualities,

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
and asked the head of the department

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
to give the assessments to his employees

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
on a 5-point scale.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
It turned out that one of the heads gave everyone 5 points,

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
the other gave everyone 3 points,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
and the third gave everyone 4 points.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
What does this mean?

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Thank God, if we didn't have the one who gave everyone 2 points.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
This means that we failed the assessment,

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
because we reduced the assessment

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
to the fact that the head expressed

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
his general opinion about his employees.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
We don't really understand what this opinion is based on.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
It is very difficult for us to achieve a situation

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
when the head of the department

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
really gives the assessments

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
in accordance with what he thinks about his employees.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
They are all different, right?

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
It is rare that they are all the same.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Here I offer several technologies.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
They are quite common.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Let's look at the slide called simple arranging.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Here they are arranged in simple alphabetical order.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
And then I, as a head,

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
receive the following instruction

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
from the person who conducts the assessment.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
I am asked to identify the best among my 9 employees,

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
in this case 3 people,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
the best ones I have.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
I choose Bender, Kareiko and Polukhaev

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
for different reasons,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
but I think they are the best.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Now when I have done this,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
I am asked to identify the best among the remaining 3.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
I choose Bender, Kareiko and Polukhaev.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
The second group is Berlag, Gritsatsuev and Pannikovsky.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
Very good.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
I identified the best among the remaining 3.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
I was asked to do this.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
The rest are the worst.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Here we use simple arranging.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Good, bad, average.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
But if I had done this,

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
I would have identified A or B,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
without taking any responsibility.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
They are all the same.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
But the technology we have just seen

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
is called the forced choice method.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
I, as an assessor,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
use the technology of assessment

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
to choose the best, the average and the worst.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
What would happen if I was asked

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
to make a list of people to be fired?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Let's say we decided to reduce the number of employees,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
and we think that the number is too large.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
I have a department, 9 people,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
let's leave 6 people.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
How would I react?

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
In this situation,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
I would show my incompetence.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
There are cases when the manager says

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
that he has a small number of people,

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
and he needs more people.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
In this situation,

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
this approach is effective.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
But we did not go into details

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
why he considers the best employees

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
and why he divides them.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
He simply divided them.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
This method can be carried out even easier

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
by simply asking the assessor

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
to list all the names

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
in the order of the increase in the quality of work,

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
again, according to the criteria

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
of a good and a bad employee,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
in the order of the increase from the best to the worst.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
This will make it psychologically more difficult,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
because it is clear that several employees

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
will be equally good, equally bad.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
Therefore, the method we have just considered

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
is more comfortable for the assessor

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
and morally justified.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
Let's consider a more complicated case.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
The question is,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
if we want to assess not one quality,

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
not one indicator,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
but several,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
as we did earlier

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
with the 360-degree assessment.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Here we use a scale,

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
which can be extended from three,

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
but this is not very good,

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
because you will usually get a 2 for everyone,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
and in very rare cases a 1 or a 3.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
You can get 5 points,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
but there is a high probability

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
to get 3 and 4 for everyone,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
so it is best to use the assessment scales

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
with a range of 7 or 10 points.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
The so-called Likert scale is used,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
which is extended from 0 to minus

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
or from 0 to plus.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
In the picture you can see such a scale,

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
where the assessment goes from minus 3 to plus 3.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
Here such indicators are assessed

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
as workability, productivity, responsibility,

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
independence, prioritization,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
ability to express your thoughts.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
The problem is what we mean

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
by workability, productivity,

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
independence, prioritization.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
If we go back to the 360-degree assessment,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
we saw that the person,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
his manager and his colleagues

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
assess him in different ways,

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
because they look at him from different points of view.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
For the manager,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
he is one, for his colleagues he is another,

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
and for his subordinates he can be the third.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
This is where the problem arises,

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
how to agree with the assessor

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
what is workability,

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
what is productivity, what is responsibility,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
and so on.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
To solve this problem,

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
a special technology called

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
the standard assessment sheet is created.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
This is a standard assessment sheet,

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
which is used to tell the assessor

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
what the assessment should mean.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
It is not just minus one,

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
plus one, plus three,

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
or plus five,

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
but a clear and unambiguous understanding

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
of what this assessment means,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
what the characteristics, qualities,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
and competencies are,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
and what the bad assessment is,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
what the average assessment is,

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
and what the good assessment is.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Let's compare two ways

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
to assess a person.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
The standard assessment sheet

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
and the traditional, classic, free-form assessment sheet.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
The assessment sheet is taken off the assessor

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
and the task is to come up with an assessment.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
No one taught him this.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
It's a complicated procedure.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
Try to write in a free form

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
your assessment of two or three qualities

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
of your good friend.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I assure you that this is not easy.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Therefore, it often happens

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
that people just rewrite the form

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
from other characteristics.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
It turns out that all the characteristics

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
are very similar to each other.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
The second point.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
If we use the free-form method,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
the assessor always has the opportunity

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
to miss something,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
to give a biased answer,

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
to give a biased answer.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
If we use the standard assessment sheet,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
then the person is forced to choose

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
one of the assessments.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
He has no way to give such an answer

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
that we do not understand what he means.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Further.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
The number of interpretations

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
is practically not given to the free-form characteristics.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
It's extremely difficult to do.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
The assessment sheet is suitable

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
for such an interpretation,

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
because it allows us to create a profile

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
of the assessment of the employee.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
For each of the formulations

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
of the assessment of certain qualities,

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
we can hang points.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
The last point.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
The assessment of many people

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
is very important.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
We evaluate candidates for promotion,

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
the need for training and development,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
the performance of the personnel audit.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
The assessment sheet,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
which is broadcast in several scales,

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
allows us to compare employees

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
and analyze the picture

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
of the company as a whole.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
The free-form characteristics

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
do not allow us to do this,

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
because they do not allow

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
the above-mentioned number of comparisons.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Such assessment sheets

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
are the most versatile,

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
convenient and common method

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
of evaluating quality indicators.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
You can find many options in the literature,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
but practice shows that

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
the assessment of the personnel

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
in each situation,

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
for each company,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
and taking into account the goals

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
that are set before the assessment,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
you will have to develop it yourself.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
What are the requirements

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
for the assessment of the personnel?

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
The first requirement

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
is to evaluate the performance

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
of the personnel in the following terms.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
This means that the person

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
behaves in a certain way,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
but does not give an abstract,

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
vague assessment.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
The second requirement

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
is to evaluate the performance

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
of the personnel in the following terms.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
This significantly reduces

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
the degree of subjectivity,

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
but at the same time

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
allows for quantitative assessment.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
The third requirement

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
is the relevance of the work

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
and the goals of the assessment.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
I would say that

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
when you invent a form,

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
you should follow

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
one simple rule.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
If you have a form,

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
tell yourself

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
how to use it

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
when you will be evaluating the personnel.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
If you are not able

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
to explain why you need it,

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
you should not do it.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
This significantly complicates the assessment.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
The last requirement

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
is the principle of reasonable sufficientness.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
How many forms should be in the assessment sheet?

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
As many as you need

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
to evaluate a person

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
and a group of people

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
and to make the necessary decisions.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
Usually, this is not required.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
Let's look at some examples

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
of the formulations from the assessment sheet.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
For example,

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
the ability to allocate priorities in work.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
The highest grade D

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
is absolutely clear

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
and completely independent

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
and knows how to allocate priorities.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
The average grade

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
is able to allocate priorities,

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
although it needs to be controlled.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Or let's take the attitude

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
of the people around them.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
The highest grade D

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
is perfectly in line with the group

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
and is respected.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
The lowest grade

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
is the conflictive personality

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
and negatively affects the relationship.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
The average grade

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
is slightly better

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
and is not attentive to the people around them.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
The average grade

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
is not a serious complaint.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
These formulations are quite clear.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
It is important to discuss

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
how a person responds to a particular formulation.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
The decision-making process

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
is much easier for the evaluator.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
What else can we say about the assessment sheets?

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
If we involve the leaders

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
in the assessment of their subordinates,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
and we have to do it almost always,

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
with a rare exception,

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
our task is to facilitate

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
the work of these people.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Let's prepare better,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
sharpen our methodology,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
make a preliminary approval,

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
and then start working.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
Thus, we solve the problem

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
of efficiency of assessment.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
We do not assign the main work

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
to the leaders,

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
but we do it for them.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
Thus, you will be able

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
to facilitate the assessment of your staff

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
and to win the respect

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
of the leaders

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
of the subordinates

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
you will involve in this work.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
The most important part of the lesson

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
So, dear colleagues,

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
we are starting

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
the most important and, I think,

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
interesting part of our lesson.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
We have found out

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
why the assessment of staff is necessary,

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
we have found out

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
what technologies and methods

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
are used in the assessment of staff,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
and now we have to put it all together

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
and agree on how you will

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
implement the assessment of staff

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
in your practice if you are given

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
such a task.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
We will consider the following questions.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
First, the criteria of efficiency

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
of assessment of staff,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
what you need to do

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
and what dangers and obstacles

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
you need to avoid in order to get

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
good, pleasant and positive results.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
We will see what can prevent this,

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
and finally we will go through

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
the algorithm of planning and assessment

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
of staff.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
You can highlight five criteria

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
The first criteria is the purpose.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
You need to clearly formulate the purpose

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
of the assessment and the criteria for its achievement.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
What does it mean?

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
You need to formulate the purpose of the assessment

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
of staff in such terms, so that when you

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
carry it out, you can clearly say whether

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
it was successful or not.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
And if it was not successful, then how many percent?

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
The second criteria is the result.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
As we have already said, the assessment of staff

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
is not the goal itself.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
It is always aimed at achieving

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
specific results and at performing

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
some management actions,

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
decisions and actions in relation to

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
the staff of our company.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Who to train, who to raise,

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
who to leave alone,

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
and who, unfortunately, will have to leave

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
our company.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Be sure to make decisions based on the results of the assessment.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
The third criteria is the effectiveness of the assessment

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
of costs.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
We have already been able to make sure that

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
the assessment of staff is a difficult and difficult matter.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
Therefore, it is not necessary to give a situation

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
where you have to make a decision

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
based on the results of the assessment.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
The next important criterion is the positive

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
impact of the assessment on organizational culture

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
and the relationship of people in the organization.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
The assessment of staff should strengthen the organization,

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
not harm it.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Unfortunately, it often turns out that the assessment

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
of staff leads to demoralization of employees,

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
but it is not a problem.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
The next criterion is the continuity and development.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
It is not necessary to assess the staff once,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
and then forget that it exists.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
It will be effective if it is carried out regularly,

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
constantly, at least once a year,

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
if it is corrected in accordance with the gained experience,

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
and if it is changed in accordance with the new goals

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
and tasks of your organization.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
This allows you to spend 3-5 years

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
analyzing the results of the assessment

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
and see which way the staff policy of your company

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
and its staff potential are moving.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
I must say that today this is one of the most important tasks

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
of the management of the organization's staff.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
What can prevent us?

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
The first thing that we often face

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
is the lack of understanding of the company,

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
the clear understanding of the goals and expected results.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Let's assess the staff. Why?

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Well, others do it, and we will assess it.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
We also often have to face such a wonderful phrase

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
that something is stuck in our company,

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
we need to make something up.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
Unfortunately, it turns out that the torment

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
of the situation in the company

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
with the help of the assessment of the staff

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
is more likely to have a negative effect on the situation than a positive one.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
The second problem is the inactivity of the management

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
after the assessment of the staff.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Well, they did it, they made it, they excited everyone,

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
everyone is terribly interested in what will happen next,

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
but nothing happens.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
And after this nothing, the whole company will treat

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
the next attempt to assess the staff

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
as a kind of a ritual, an action that can be participated in or not.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
In fact, no one needs it,

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
let's say, the fanfare of the higher management, no more.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
The next very unpleasant obstacle is the resistance

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
of the management staff to the implementation of innovations.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
The axiom of innovation management is that

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
companies always resist innovations.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Some do not understand why this is necessary,

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
others see some danger for themselves,

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
and even a threat.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
The third is not sure of their strength

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
and not sure if they will cope,

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
whether they are competent with work in new conditions.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
And the implementation of the assessment system of the staff

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
in the company is completely, unfortunately,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
falls under these possible obstacles.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
First of all, because the main resource

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
in the assessment of the staff, as we have repeatedly said,

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
is the managers of the first line.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
And they, unfortunately, are often against it.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
They do not understand why this is necessary,

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
they do not know how to do it,

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
and they have certain moral problems,

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
the need to assess their staff, which they have never done before.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
It is also a need to make pleasant and unpleasant decisions,

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
and people do not like it very much.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
The next danger is the consequence of ineffective PR.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
If we do not organize a positive public opinion in the company

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
about the assessment of the staff,

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
it will most likely cause suspicion,

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
rumors, and you know that the radio is usually negative.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
In the vast majority of people,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
they are more likely to believe in negative gossip and rumors

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
than in positive.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
If you do not conduct a positive PR,

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
you will be a victim of a negative public opinion.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
If you do not conduct a positive PR,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
you will most likely have problems.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The next obstacle is a poorly thought-out methodological assessment.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I mean the technologies and methods we have recently considered.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
These technologies and methods must fully meet the tasks set by us

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and meet the criteria of efficiency.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Finally, there is also a problem of violating the rights of the assessed persons.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
According to the results of the assessment,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
we will make administrative decisions.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
It often turns out that the decisions and actions taken by the company

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
according to the results of the assessment,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
do not comply with the labor law.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
For example, you decided to fire several employees.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
You need to prove that your assessment was objective,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
that they do not correspond to the position taken.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Otherwise, you will most likely be tried,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
and the court may decide not in favor of the company,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
but in favor of the offended employee.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
What do we need to make the assessment effective?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
The first and main requirement is to sponsor the work of the assessed person

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
by the company's management.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Why?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
In this case, sponsorship means approval and direct participation.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
The main persons in the company are the people who give the assessment,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
who are responsible for the assessment.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
The main persons are the people who give the assessment,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
who are responsible for the assessment.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
The main persons in the company should not just say,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
OK, let's make the assessment and see what happens.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
They should be actively involved in the assessment.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Then the company will see that it is really important and necessary.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The company's higher management should always set an example for others.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
The second requirement is the support of all the participants in the assessment.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
What participants?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
The participants should be the leaders of the company,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and the employees themselves.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
The employees should understand that the company needs them.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
They need to be the leaders of the company.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
In the best case, people are eagerly waiting for the assessment.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
This is a chance for them to get promotion,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
to get a better job,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
or to go to school.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
The next requirement is the distribution of functions and responsibilities of all participants.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
This means that everyone who is involved in the assessment should know when, where, what and how to do it.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And also the responsibility.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
In particular, the managers should understand what responsibility they bear for the assessment of their employees.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
In the best case, this responsibility should be attached to the official responsibilities of the managers.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
The next requirement is the procedural and documentary support.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
This means that the company should have the necessary documents.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
The assessment should be carefully developed.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It is often necessary to include the assessment in the general assessment of the company.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
The assessment should be carefully developed.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It should be analyzed.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
If it does not happen, the assessment of the employees will be lost.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Finally, the implementation of the results and the assessment of the effectiveness of the work.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
The assessment of the results is the implementation of the management decisions.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The assessment of the effectiveness of the work.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
These are the conditions for the assessment of the employees of your company.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The assessment of the employees of your company should be carried out without irritation, doubt, or disappointment.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
What is needed to make the assessment of the employees of the company effective and make it a permanent, convenient and useful tool?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
First of all, it must be well planned.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
This planning takes place in five steps.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
The first thing we should do is determine the goals and expected results.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
The second thing is to evaluate the resources we will need, the deadlines of our assessment, and the participants.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
The third thing is to choose the technology and the methods we will use.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The fourth thing is to determine who will make the decisions on the results of the assessment.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
The fifth thing is to ensure the feedback and the quality of the work.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The sixth thing is to determine the rights of the evaluated employees.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
The goals and the expected results.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
We must clearly and unambiguously answer the question of what we want to achieve as a result of the assessment of the staff.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
The second thing is to determine who is the client or customer of the event.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Who is needed in the company? Who is profitable in the company?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Who is useful in the company?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
The next question is what specific management decisions should be made after the assessment of the employees.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
What should the evaluation look like?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
What should the final results of the assessment look like?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And the last key question is what case we will consider successful.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
The next question is about the resources, participants and deadlines of the assessment.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
The first key question is the composition of the evaluated employees.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Who will we evaluate? How many of them? Who are they?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Who will participate in the assessment?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Who will evaluate? Who will evaluate?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And who will evaluate?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Will we use the 360-degree assessment?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
As we know, it brings good results, but on the other hand, it makes our work much more difficult and long.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
The next question is the role of the average management and the higher management of the company.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
What functions and duties will be assigned to the managers?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Who will participate in the assessment? Who will evaluate?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And what decisions will be made by the managers after the assessment?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
In the end, we can try to estimate how much working time and how the work we have planned will be done.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
What are the costs of labor?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
How effective will these costs be in terms of the goals we set for ourselves?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And maybe we should try to do without assessment and achieve our results with the help of other management tools?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The next question is technology and methods.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
What will we evaluate?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The results of work, competence and skills, behavior of people.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The choice of these methods and technologies is tied to the goals we set for ourselves.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
What methods will we use to evaluate?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Do we have them at our disposal?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
As a rule, no.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
If we only start evaluating the staff of the company, we will have to look for these methods, or even create them ourselves.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
As a rule, the methods of assessment, even very good ones, taken from good authoritative sources, will be used in the company.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
The next question is the technology of generalization and analysis of results.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
If we have to evaluate not only each employee individually, but also the overall picture of the company, we should have this technology in mind from the very beginning.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
We should not be in front of a mountain of documents that cannot be combined.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And finally, the format of the report on the results of the assessment for the management.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
If the management is the customer and the sponsor of the assessment, it will want to see what you have achieved.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
It is very good to coordinate the format of this report before the assessment, so that you and your managers know what will be obtained as a result.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Who and in what order will you present the results of the assessment?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Will they be brought to all customers and all managers of the company in the same format?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
As a rule, this is not always correct.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
It often turns out that the first persons deserve to receive the information in full, and the separate managers of the departments are, let's say, part of them.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
The next question is the quality of the assessment.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The quality of the assessment is very important.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
The quality of the assessment is very important.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
The quality of the assessment is very important.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The quality of the assessment is very important.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
The next question is who and what conclusions should be made?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Who and in what order will make decisions?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Our customers received the results of the assessment.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Who, when and how and what decisions will be made?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
This is a very important question, because it is directly based on one of the criteria for the effectiveness of the assessment.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And finally, how will the results be realized?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Imagine that we have made a decision that a significant part of the company's assets will be invested in the development of the company.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And this significant part of the company's employees will need to undergo training.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And how will this be done?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Will you hire and invite third-party performers to your company?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Or will you organize a training center in your company?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And there is also a question of how much it will cost.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And does the company have such resources?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And is it ready to invest them immediately and conduct training for the next two months?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And is it ready to invest them immediately and conduct training for the next two months?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Or will all this work be extended, let's say, for a year?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
In other words, in the end, the decisions you make on the results of the assessment should turn into a technical task and a work plan for those who will implement them.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
In our case, this is the responsibility for training and development of the staff.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
In most companies, it will be the same HR manager or HR director who conducted the assessment.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And finally, the question of feedback.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Having planned the assessment, we must check the feedback.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
How legitimate will our actions be in terms of the current labor law?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
The second question is in what form the results of the assessment will be brought to the employees.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
There are a lot of solutions here, starting from the situation when we can not even inform them that the assessment was carried out.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
This is the case when we conduct a personnel audit, primarily based on the existing companies' statistical data on the work of our employees.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And we can conduct a separate, serious, large interview with each of them.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
The question of feedback is directly related to the important topic of the relationship, organizational culture and the influence of the events we conduct on it.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
The last question that must be addressed is the possibility of a series of appeals.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Imagine that you have decided that Bender, Gritsatsuev, and Khrushchev are not responsible for the work of the company.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And you have decided that Khrushchev, Balaganov, and Kozlevich are involved in the reserve movement.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
But for some reason, Panikovsky was not involved, you did not like him.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Would he like to become a manager? He has been waiting for a promotion in his service for a long time.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Does he have the right to express his point of view or not?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
In what format can your employees express their attitude to the results of the assessment, appeal, argue?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
This is also necessary to consider.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Dear colleagues, we have come to the end of our course.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Now I will ask you to complete the task from your workbook to the fourth chapter.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And then, what is the most interesting, I ask you to solve the case about the company Siniybuival.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I want to say right away that this case is not made up.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It is taken from real practice of a real company.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
And the events that you will learn about took place in 2007.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I must add that to solve this case, you will need almost all the knowledge,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
almost everything that we have gone through throughout our course.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
So you can consider this a graduation exam.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
How well you will cope with it, we will find out after you give answers to all the questions of this case.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It may turn out that your decisions will be even more elegant, more interesting than those that I will offer you.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
So, colleagues, I hope that you have successfully completed the tasks.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And now let's try to compare the decision of the case that you gave with some of the considerations that I have given.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Let's start with the question number one.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
How useful is it to start solving the problems of the company with the assessment of the staff?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
What other actions should be taken?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
This is a very important question, because, as we have already said many times,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
the assessment of the staff is just a tool.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And if you can use other tools instead of it, then you should probably try to do it.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And if you can use other tools instead of it, then you should probably try to do it.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And if you can use other tools instead of it, then you should probably try to do it.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And in some cases, other tools are generally necessary.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Let's recall what effective staff management is.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
This is when the right people are in the right places.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
What do we know about the organization of the Blue Buoy?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Now it is going through a very difficult stage in its biography,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
which is very typical for many of our companies.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
This is a sharp growth, a sharp quantitative growth,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
which naturally leads to a qualitative growth.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Relationships become more complicated, new people appear.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The previous semi-family atmosphere, when everyone does everything,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
is no longer effective.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
If you read the text of the case carefully,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
you could notice that the company does not have a clear structure.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It means that before solving the issue with the staff and its assessment,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
it is necessary to solve the issue with the places where these right people should be.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Are these places organized correctly?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Most likely, this company needs to reorganize management,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
to change the management tools,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
to introduce technologies that are more suitable for its current content

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
and the current problems it faces,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
and to improve the current stage of its development.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
But the company decided to start with people.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
What are the problems that the company is trying to solve with the help of staff assessment?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The breakdown of projects,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
the claims of clients,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
the care of clients.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Should we start solving these problems with the assessment of the staff?

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
But I would probably first look at what projects were made poorly,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
what was done wrong,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
what needs to be changed in the organization of the company's work,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
and then think about the assessment of the staff.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
The second question is how clearly and constructively the goals of the assessment are formulated.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I think that they are quite specific and clear.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
There are three goals.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
The first is to improve the staff's qualifications.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
The second is to change the motivation system.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
The third is to regroup people in accordance with their abilities and capabilities.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
These are quite noble and specifically formulated goals.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It is difficult to refute their design.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
The only thing that is missing is a clear explanation of what we will do

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
after these goals are implemented.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
The third question is how the measures carried out by the company

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
by Siniy Boevel correspond to the criteria of the efficiency of the staff assessment system.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
But it is not so easy to answer this question.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Let's recall the criteria of the efficiency of the staff assessment system

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
and go over them from top to bottom.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
The first criterion is purposefulness.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
We have already concluded that the goals set by the company

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
could be achieved in other ways.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
But the goals of the assessment itself are formulated quite clearly.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
The second criterion is the effectiveness of the decisions

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
made on the basis of the assessment.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
As we have seen, the assessment did not produce any special results.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Therefore, the decisions were made on a completely different basis.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
The question is whether the director of Siniy Boevel could have made the same decisions

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
without the assessment.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
If he had made the decisions, he could have done so.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
The third criterion is the efficiency of the costs.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It is difficult to assess the efficiency of the costs,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
because we have not received any results.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
As we know, there is no point in dividing by zero in mathematics.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
The fourth criterion is the positive influence on the organizational culture.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
We do not have the data on what the employees began to do,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
speak, think and behave after the assessment.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
We do not have the data on how the employees filled the assessment sheets

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and what happened as a result.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I remind you that the situation was that the company was doing poorly,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
but everyone was doing well.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Most likely, they were very formal about this procedure

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
and it did not affect the organization's situation.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Finally, the success of the development.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
If the company fails to make an assessment, it must continue to do so.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
In this case, we do not have the data on the decisions of the director.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
It is possible that the best option would be to repeat the assessment next year,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
but taking into account all the shortcomings and problems

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
that arose based on the previous experience.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I hope this experience was useful for the company.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
The fourth question is how to characterize the technology of assessment

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
used in the company Blue Buoyant.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
If we look at the questionnaires that the employees filled,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
we will see that no special technology was used here.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
This is a cocktail of all the technologies that we discussed.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Here is a template of the test stations,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
since the questionnaire is filled in an open form.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
There are no options for answers.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
There are some elements of the 360-degree assessment,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
but we do not understand how they were used,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
because it is not clear who assessed whom.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
In short, the following happened in this situation.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
The organizers of this assessment took the elements of almost all technologies

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
that are used for this above all.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
None of them was used to the end.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
But we must say that they took not the strongest sides of these technologies,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
so they probably had problems.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
The fifth question is about the formal attitude

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
of the company's employees to the assessment.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
If you look at the questionnaires that the company employees filled,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
you will see that it is extremely difficult to give an answer

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
to most of these questions.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Try to do this exercise.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Take the questionnaire and answer as you would answer.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
People who are given such questions

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
may consider that the questions are too intimate.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
They may think that the company does not need to know

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
their point of view on the questions that are asked,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
for example, about strategic plans for the future.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Moreover, the reaction of the employees,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
which is indicated in the text of our case,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
shows that the preparation, PR,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
the attention of the employees to the assessment,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
the explanation of why it is being carried out and what results await them,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
was probably not carried out very well.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
What actions of the assessment organizers would have allowed to avoid formalism?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The first thing is to choose the right tool for the assessment.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
The second thing is to carry out high-quality PR

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and to attract the main participants of the assessment,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
that is, the direct managers, to their side.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The sixth point is to give your assessment

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
using the 1.2 application method.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
What do they correspond to and what do they not correspond to

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
in the 1.2 application method?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
The first thing that draws attention to itself is that there are a lot of questions,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
and the vast majority of these questions do not relate to the goals of the assessment.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
The second point is that the organizers did not take the trouble

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
to offer the assessment options.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Therefore, after filling out the application,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
they had to come up with them themselves.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Most likely, they decided to free themselves from this work,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
so they gave some average and positive,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
and most likely the same ratings for all positions.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
The seventh question is how to change the format of the content of both surveys.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Most likely, standardized assessment sheets should be developed.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Most likely, each question should have 5-6 different answers.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Of course, they should be made politically correct,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
that is, it is quite difficult not to force people to answer the questions

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
that they can answer.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And, judging by the fact that the company has such a family atmosphere,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
people are simply afraid to spoil the relationship with their subordinates.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
It would probably be better not to use a scale in the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mode,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
which is immediately associated with good or bad,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
but to give options for answers, possibly with indexing by letter,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
and, of course, to remember the principle of reasonable sufficiency

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
and reduce the number of answers to the minimum necessary.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Finally, the last question.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
How can the results and consequences of the assessment

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
affect its implementation next year?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I am afraid that it will be negative,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
primarily because people have already seen that the assessment is conducted formally once,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
that it can be conducted formally twice,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
and that the results of the assessment are taken into account when distributing the prize,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
and there will be no three motivations.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
So, most likely, we will meet resistance again,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
at best passive, and maybe even active resistance of the assessment staff.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Therefore, the first thing to do is to conduct an audit

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
based on the data that the company has,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
on the experience of the employees, on the participation in certain projects,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
on the results of the work in these projects,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
whether the projects were completed or not, who made what mistakes.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
All this can be done without disturbing people.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
As a second stage of the assessment,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
the survey of both employees and their managers can be conducted.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But, of course, by constructing assessment lists in a completely different way,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
by correctly and clearly formulating possible assessment options,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
it is absolutely necessary to attract the managers of the departments,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
to conduct very serious work with them,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and to show not only what the company will receive for conducting the assessment,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
but also why it is needed by them as a manager,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
what management tools it gives them,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
and to remove the anxiety of people,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
and to show that the negative results of the assessment

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
will not seriously affect the atmosphere of the company,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
but, on the contrary, will contribute to its prosperity and further development.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
These are the answers I would offer to these questions.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Compare them with those you gave.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Maybe you were more successful than I was.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
If the results of the answers to these questions are close enough,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
then you have successfully completed the assessment course.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
And, most likely, if you have to face this difficult task in practice,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
you will succeed.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I wish you all the best. Thank you for your attention.
