00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
Good afternoon, dear colleagues. I am Oleg Evgenievich Boksansky, Professor of the Russian Economic Academy, MIPLEKHANOV.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
I teach various components of MBA courses, management of personnel, management of human resources, management of organizations.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
Today's topic is personnel training, more precisely, individual and organizational training.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
If we consider the entire sector of personnel training, we can highlight several major blocks,

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
which are present in every large organization, in which there is a well-established and well-organized structure of personnel training.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
First of all, it is, of course, selection of personnel.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Then it is about training and development of personnel.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
This is a rather important piece, which is directly related to the prospects of development of employees in the company,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
which is related to the personnel reserve, its creation, its construction,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
which is related to the design of personnel trajectories of specialists working in the organization.

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
It is very close, together with training and development, there is a block of assessment and motivation of personnel.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
Because when we try to build assessment criteria, competence criteria,

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
the prospects of development of a person, his personnel movement, vertical and horizontal rotation,

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
we must assess it and identify the motivation system.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Why is a person interested in working in an organization?

01:52.000 --> 02:02.000
How can we ensure that a person works more actively, not formally, but approaches the case with interest

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
and, accordingly, makes a worthy contribution to the work of his company?

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
Therefore, the topic of training and development is, in fact, the key and central one,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
when we consider different aspects of personnel functioning,

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
because, in fact, it is, on the one hand, a necessary continuation of the topic of selection of personnel.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
When we take a person on vacation, we must, firstly, adapt him to the implementation of the functions that he performs,

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
and, secondly, teach him to perform these functions as it is customary in the company,

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
teach him to function in such a way that the return from the actions that he performs

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
is the most useful, the most effective, the most fruitful.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
And, of course, only after we have invested the means of training and development of a person,

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
we can talk about evaluation and motivation, about the evaluation criteria,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
what criteria can be studied from the point of view of grading,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
what criteria can be studied from the point of view of performance indicators, and so on.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
And, accordingly, depending on the training that we conduct,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
we can talk about motivation, motivation related to the work of a person in the company,

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
to the return of a person in the company, and, accordingly, to the development of the career growth,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
the career development of this person.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
The topic of training is a rather extensive topic,

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
and, as you understand, during our meeting, we will not be able to consider it in detail,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
to find out any nuances.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Our task is more modest.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
To set the main positions, main directions, main goals that arise before the organization,

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
which wants to train its employees in order to achieve specific advantages

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
in the market in which other companies function,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
and, accordingly, to win and develop its niche market,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
which is associated with those actions, with that product, with those services that the company provides.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Naturally, if we are talking about training,

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
then what characteristics are usually used to characterize this process?

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
In order to highlight the main characteristics,

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
we will turn to the most frequently used criteria for training,

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
because it is from the analysis of these criteria that the degree of return of those investments,

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
which are invested in training, is assessed.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Indeed, perhaps, if we consider the entire range of work with the staff,

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
then a rather large amount of money is invested in training and development,

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
which is associated with the need to conclude agreements with providers,

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
to attract high-quality teachers so that they can share their experience,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
can indicate and prevent possible mistakes,

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
and, naturally, such teachers who are already successful in the field in which the company operates

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
and in the field in which the teaching is conducted.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
When we talk about business education, there is a very important difference with academic education.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
When we come to study at the university,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
then, accordingly, there is a curriculum,

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
and regardless of what subjects we like, what we want,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
we must study this curriculum if we want to get a diploma.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
This is academic education, and this is its plus and minus,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
because academic education is really fundamental,

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
and it, in fact, prepares a person to be able to engage in different areas of activity,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
which are defined by his specialty.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
When we talk about business education and the teaching of business education,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
the situation is fundamentally different.

06:30.000 --> 06:40.000
Business education does not imply that I will invest in a person the knowledge that he should have received.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
The problem arises with the fact that there is a specialist here,

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
and, accordingly, I need to improve the skills that he has,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
to specify, to specialize the knowledge that he has,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
because, naturally, if a specialist comes to work in a company,

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
he already has his own traditions, his own methods of approach to solving the tasks that will be faced by him,

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
and it is necessary to pass on these already developed skills, knowledge, methods.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Then they can be changed, then they can be modified,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
but only then, in order not to invent a bicycle from scratch.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
In this regard, business education is always practical.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I do not take a person who knows absolutely nothing,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
and I do not prepare a person who I need from him.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
If we work in a company, then, naturally, in the event of a vacancy,

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
we select those people who have the necessary level of preparation in order to meet this vacancy.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
But, then the specifics begin.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
The specifics of the company, the specifics of the market, the specifics of the product, the specifics of the services.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
And in order for a person to get involved as quickly as possible in the most effective functioning,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
he needs to pass on these specifics as quickly as possible.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
These are the tasks that are solved by learning in business processes.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Therefore, in addition to this important distinction between academic education and business education,

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
the main criterion that testifies to the effectiveness of learning is the modification of the behavior of the employee.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Moreover, in this case, we are talking about the modification of professional behavior.

08:35.000 --> 08:44.000
A person quickly acquires, refines those skills, those actions, those ways of seeing,

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
which he needs for the successful performance of the function that is assigned to him.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
The faster this modification of behavior is carried out, the more successful the education.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Success here depends on two factors, the main two factors.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Naturally, there can be many factors.

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
The first is, of course, related to the speed of the formation of the necessary skills, the necessary ways of reacting.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And the second factor is related to the stability of these skills.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
If I was prepared today and, accordingly, passed on those skills, but did not work well enough,

09:24.000 --> 09:37.000
then these skills will fail, there will be a backlash, and I will still have to get the results that I need on my own mistakes, on my own experience.

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
If, for example, we made a mistake in the contract, which is entitled to a large amount, then the price of this mistake can be great.

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
That is why, when we talk about business education, the modification of behavior is the leading criterion that is considered here.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And I would like to draw your attention to the modification of professional behavior.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
The modification of professional behavior implies corporate culture, but still, first of all,

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
it is those or other professional competencies that should be in the hands of the employee,

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
who occupies the appropriate position and fulfills those or other functional duties.

10:24.000 --> 10:32.000
So, this is the first and, perhaps, one of the most global fundamental characteristics of education,

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
according to which the success of business education is assessed, is the modification of behavior, professional behavior.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
But here, again, it is necessary to pay special attention to the fact that this modification of behavior,

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
the development of those or other ways of reacting, the development of those or other ways of functioning,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
should be characterized by such a criterion as permanence.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
There should not be any temporary results.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Today I use these results, tomorrow I do not use them, I forgot about them,

11:07.000 --> 11:18.000
and if those or other circumstances change, I have to re-learn, remember, adjust to the previous skill.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
Good learning should lead to automatism, and there is nothing wrong with that.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
In this case, when we talk about business functioning, we are talking about the performance of certain functions,

11:33.000 --> 11:43.000
certain tasks, and before we build those or other venture schemes, those or other creative solutions,

11:44.000 --> 11:54.000
we must be sure that all the necessary aggregate of actions that we must perform will be performed automatically.

11:55.000 --> 12:07.000
Only when we are sure that we will not stumble upon those or other daily routine operations,

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
only then can we talk about innovations, only then can we talk about something creative.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
In fact, the situation is very simple.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
You should not invent a bicycle.

12:20.000 --> 12:31.000
In business, it is a waste of time and money, and the price here can be incompatible with the results that can be obtained.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Therefore, the permanence of the worked behavior, the worked professional competence,

12:39.000 --> 12:47.000
is the second important criterion, which is related to the success of the modification of the behavior that has occurred.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
The next thing to pay attention to, if we consider the characteristics of the success of learning,

12:55.000 --> 13:07.000
is the understanding of the fact that changes in professional activity, changes in the professionalism of an employee

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
do not necessarily have to follow the experience of learning.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
The fact is that if we have listened to the most wonderful training courses,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
if we have worked out the most wonderful skills, these will still be new skills for us.

13:27.000 --> 13:37.000
A person is simply so arranged that he often prefers to use already familiar, already worked out, already familiar schemes for him.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
If I use something new, there is still some risk here.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
What if it doesn't work?

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
What if the results I get are worse than what I can get?

13:52.000 --> 14:03.000
And in the end, a person really does not like to give up on the usual ways of behavior.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
Therefore, naturally, we learn in order to change our professional success.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
But this does not mean that we will immediately change it.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
It is necessary to create a suitable psychological climate,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
it is necessary to have the appropriate management conditions,

14:25.000 --> 14:34.000
it is necessary to have the appropriate support in order for me to really apply new experience,

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
new knowledge, new competencies, without being afraid to be ridiculed.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
We are all different.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Someone learns something successfully and quickly.

14:44.000 --> 14:54.000
Someone needs a long time to learn, but then he becomes an ace in performing certain actions.

14:55.000 --> 15:04.000
And this long process is connected with careful study, analysis of certain events that may occur.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
A person first examines, analyzes those or other actions inside himself,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
analyzes possible risks that follow,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and only after I have already set up a certain cognitive scheme,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
which we will talk about later today,

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
only after I have already calculated everything,

15:29.000 --> 15:39.000
when I have already worked in advance in terms of what difficulties may arise,

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
and I have already created a program for overcoming these difficulties.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
It is not necessary to arise, for my calmness it is necessary,

15:47.000 --> 15:56.000
if something unusual happens, I should be ready for it.

15:57.000 --> 16:06.000
Therefore, you do not need to dream of a magic wand and think that if we, as the company managers,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
have invested large funds in training staff,

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
then when they come from training, our business performance will rise to the sky the next day.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
No, it will not.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
They will rise the next day.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
They can rise in a week, in a month, in six months.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
This is normal.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
As practice and experience of foreign companies show,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
in which the training system has been developing for almost two centuries,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
the third is qualitative training.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
This is not the kind of training that gives results immediately.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
Qualitative training is the kind of training that modifies professional behavior

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
and gives a stable, constant result in connection with the newly acquired experience.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
This is the third characteristic of training.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
The next characteristic of training is that, in fact,

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
the experience of performing certain functions,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
certain actions, the experience of interacting and communicating with employees,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
the experience of management, the experience of management.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
And at the same time, it should be borne in mind that this change in experience

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
comes from everyday practice.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
We can read a huge number of really good books.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
In the list of literature that will be offered to our course,

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
there are many books that have proven their demand, their applicability, their effectiveness.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
But this is a description of someone's success,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
a description of someone's luck,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
a description of what happens in other companies,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
in other conditions, in another business environment.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
And this does not mean that if we try to apply the results

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
that have been published in these books one-to-one,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
we will get the same results.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
This is a very important stage, because it is often believed

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
that there are different providers, different business institutions,

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
different companies that are able to conduct the training

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
that they have recommended.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
They have recommended themselves in some companies,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
but we need to be prepared for the fact that we will not always

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
get the same results.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
And here again, a subtle point.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
There can be significant changes in the business environment,

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
there can be significant changes in the processes that surround us,

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
but, for example, these changes will not be enough to satisfy the management,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
and the management will be dissatisfied.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
So here again, there is a difference between objective and subjective characteristics.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Objectively, the indicators have really increased.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
For example, the volume of sales increased by 10%,

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
and this is a good indicator if we take the market analysis.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
But on the other hand, the management of the company is dissatisfied.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
It invested funds to increase sales by 60%.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
Here is a very important problem that arises with the gap

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
between the level of achievement and the level of compulsion.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Compulsions can be very high,

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
but these compulsions can be different from the real reality.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
And accordingly, when we evaluate the results of the training,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
when we evaluate the events that have occurred,

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
it is necessary to agree on the criteria

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
on which we will evaluate the results,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
so that there is no disappointment,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
so that there is no deception of hopes,

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
disappointed expectations,

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
so that the experience of a fairly successful training,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
which is a successful training, is always an expensive training.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
In principle, as the same experience shows,

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
cheap training never leads to results.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
So, investments were made big,

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
and the expected results turned out to be less than we would like.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
And in this situation, it is necessary to turn to the market analysis

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
and see if the results that are obtained are really so bad,

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
and to compare my expectations with the achievements that are really achieved.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
And one more important criterion that we need to remember

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
when we consider the training.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
No matter how good the experience is,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
no matter what good skills we have received,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
they always need to be strengthened.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
This is what happens very often.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
If a person has started to succeed,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
if he has started to achieve the results that he did not achieve before,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
he must experience the reinforcement of his success.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
If this reinforcement does not exist,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
then a person loses motivation for further work, for further functioning.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
We will talk in detail about reinforcement,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
about punishments and various sanctions that are usually applied in the business environment.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
But for now, we need to pay attention to the fact that

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
the training will only bring results

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
if its consequences are reinforced.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
If the results of this training will be strengthened,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
motivated and stimulated,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
the employee should...

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
People love praise, we are all living people,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
and we should not be stingy with this praise.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
If there is really something to praise for,

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
it is when a particular employee is active,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
takes responsibility,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
demonstrates willingness to work more,

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
and does not involve his or her functional responsibilities.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
So, we have discussed five main criteria

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
that are used to analyze the success and effectiveness of the training.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
To sum up,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
if you open different books,

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
and the training is now devoted to a large number of literature,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
not only domestic,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
there is a huge number of translations of literature.

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
And the translations that are available now are books from the 60s, 70s, 80s.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
As for the Russian specificity,

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
we are starting to implement the schemes

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
that were popular 10, 20, 30 years ago.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Now they have been abandoned,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
or not, but we are taking the old,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
classical schemes and making the same mistakes

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
that have been tested for a long time,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and that could have been prevented.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
So, if we look at the literature,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
usually these five criteria are the significant,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
essential characteristics that can testify to the learning,

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
and in fact testify to the effectiveness of the return of the funds invested in the training.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
We have already talked about the fact that the training is an expensive process.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
And in this regard, the problem arises.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
If I make investments,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
will I be at a loss,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
as the company's manager,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
will I be at a loss,

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
or will I achieve significant results from the point of view of market analytics?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
Although, again, I would like to draw your attention to the fact

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
that there are different authors, different criteria,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
but in principle, these five are the ones

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
that most of the recognized authorities agree on.

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
So, this is what concerns the characteristics of the learning process.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
Now let's look at the different approaches

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
that exist in learning,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
and, accordingly, we will analyze their advantages,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
their advantages,

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
and what these approaches complement each other.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I want to say right away,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
that at the moment,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
in Russian education,

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
we have moved away from the old scheme, when we argued about which approach was better.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Who gives better results?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Behaviorists? Cognitivists?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Practitioners? Theorists?

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
Now, we have reached the understanding of a very simple point.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
In business, different tasks arise.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Different problems arise before the business.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Business operates in different conditions, in different environments.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
And, accordingly, if we want to solve a particular task,

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
we must take from the accumulated archive of tools

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
those tools that will be the most successful in solving the tasks that arise before us.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Therefore, we, looking at the theory,

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
the approaches that exist in learning,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
we will look at them.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
And I would like to make a point here,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
that we have reached a fundamental understanding.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Not from the point of view of what the first, second, third was,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
who replaced whom, and who was better, who was worse,

26:54.000 --> 27:00.000
but from the point of view that each approach is tested for decades,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
not just for decades.

27:04.000 --> 27:14.000
A set of technologies, methods, concepts, solutions,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
which turned out to be successful in their area of application.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
And, accordingly, if we want to solve those tasks that arise

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
specifically before our company,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
specifically before our partners,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
specifically before our employees,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
then we must choose from this abundance of tools

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
the one that will be the most successful.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
From the point of view of investment, one,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
from the point of view of success, two,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
and from the point of view of the existence of the result, three.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Everything we talked about, we did not start with the criteria in vain.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
And each of the approaches that we will consider

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
is just to evaluate, to analyze from the point of view of those criteria

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
that we talked about.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
The first approach that is used in business learning

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
is the behavioral approach.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
It is called differently, and we have already talked about it

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
when we were considering the methodology of business.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
This approach is called behavioral, behaviorist.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It is important because it is no more than a copy

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
of the English behaviorist.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
And, again, many approaches that we will consider today,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
you are already familiar with them.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
But today we will look at all these approaches

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
from a slightly different point of view.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
From a different point of view, from the point of view of the tool

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
that it gives us.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Earlier we talked about the punitive structure,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
the basic positions, methodologies, ways of application.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
Today we will talk about the tools that are in each approach

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
and which are used to solve those or other tasks

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
that arise directly when building a process of learning,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
a process of learning an employee, when building a learning organization.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
The behavioral approach in the business direction

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
is closely related to Skinner.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
If we talk about the originator of behaviorism,

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
it is John Watson, who introduced the concept of behaviorism

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
and gave the requirements that were then developed,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
systematized and applied.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
As for Barris Skinner,

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
he, based on the developed methods,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
developed approaches,

29:58.000 --> 30:06.000
created a very extensive tool for influencing behavior.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
As for Skinner,

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
he actually highlighted a new type of behavior

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
that was not considered in psychology and science before.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
This is so-called operant behavior.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
What is it?

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
Since our task is to analyze the practical application,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
we will not go into details,

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
the main thing is that we have an understanding.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
There are two types of behavior.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
This is respondent behavior and operant behavior.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
As for respondent behavior,

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
it is a well-known Pavlovian term,

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
conditional reflexes.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
Skinner calls this type of training S,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
to emphasize the importance of stimulus.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
This is a stimulus training.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
S stands for the word stimulus.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Accordingly, there is an old good tradition of behaviorism.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
There are external stimuli that affect the human body.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
There is a reaction of a person to these stimuli.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Stimulus and reaction are respondent behaviors.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
It exists, it was perfectly considered by Pavlov.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Skinner actually believed that after Pavlov,

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
there was nothing else to do in respondent behavior.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
He discovered everything that was necessary.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
As for Skinner, he was a practitioner.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
The main thing for him was to get a practical result.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
This is what is characteristic of all behaviorism.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
In this regard, he was quite cool about theory.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Because theory is our idea of ​​the scheme.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Skinner was a behaviorist.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
He was not interested in what was in our heads.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
He was interested in the results we achieve.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
He was interested in the behavior of a person.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
We will not get into the head.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Because this is a very subjective thing.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
But we will always see what a person does,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
how successful he is at it,

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
what he succeeds and what he fails.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
We can study behavior objectively.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Therefore, let's study it.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
But we will leave everything that is in the head to the psychologist.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
This was the idea that Skinner fully supported.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
As for Pavlov's respondent training,

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
this is a training that really exists.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
It is inherent in both humans, animals, rats, mice, and worms.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The main thing is to have a nervous system.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
If there is a nervous system that reacts to stimuli from the outside world,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
it gives a certain reaction.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
Accordingly, after the stimulus is exerted, there is a certain reaction.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
But Skinner thought about the fact that human behavior,

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
I draw your attention again, is about behavior,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
not about the psyche, not about thinking.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
This will be a lot of cognitive approach.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
What we will consider further after Skinner.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Skinner was based on the fact that a person behaves somehow.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
A person does something.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
Is there a difference in human behavior from animal behavior?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Since for Skinner as a behaviorist,

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
this entire inner psychological life was uninteresting,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
he did not deny it, he just did not deal with it.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Accordingly, Skinner drew attention to the fact that

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
a person, like other higher animals,

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
does not only react to external stimuli.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
A person has a certain behavior.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
What does this behavior do?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
What does a person do?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
What does an animal do?

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
We do it to get some kind of reactions,

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
because these reactions give certain consequences.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Either the consequences are positive for the body,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
we went there, found food,

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
we did a job, got a material reward,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
we took the initiative, we were scolded.

34:42.000 --> 34:49.000
Accordingly, human behavior leads to various consequences.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
And then a person looks at these consequences.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
If these consequences are positive for a person,

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
then Skinner says that this human behavior

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
that leads to the consequences that suit a person,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
is behavior with reinforcement.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
I am satisfied with the result.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Therefore, I build a certain line of behavior

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
in order to then get a certain result.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I know that to get a result,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
you need to take a certain number of steps.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
It can be long, it can be short.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
This sequence of steps can be complex,

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
it can be simple.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
It can trigger different reactions,

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
different schemes of behavior,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
different behavior programs.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
This term, by the way, is Skinner's,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
because Skinner, as we have already discussed,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
considering the methodology of organizational behavior,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
introduced the concept of programmed learning.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
So, Skinner said that human behavior

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
is a certain program that he implements.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
And therefore, this program has the consequences

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
of behavior that leads to the consequences that suit me.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
And, accordingly, if I want to get these consequences,

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
then these consequences reinforce my behavior.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And there are consequences that do not suit me.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
That is, if I do something,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
I will get an undesirable result.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
If I am constantly late for work, I will be fired.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
If I want to be fired,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
then I will be late and I will be fired,

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
and it is the fault of the management.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
So, they fired me.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
If I do not want to be fired,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I must change my behavior

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
in order not to get an undesirable result.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Consequently, it will be an abomination of undesirable behavior.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Or a punishment.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Skinner, and we will talk about this a little later,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
considers not only reinforcement, but also punishment.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Reinforcement contributes to behavior,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
but punishment, on the contrary,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
stops any behavior.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
Therefore, Skinner introduces a new concept of behavior,

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
operant behavior.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Or he calls it a behavior

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
conditioned on the type R,

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
the type of reaction.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
That is, it is not important here the stimulus that affected me,

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
but the reaction that I will get

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
if I implement a program of any behavior.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
If this reaction suits me,

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
it reinforces my behavior.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
If it does not suit me,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
it leads to an abomination of undesirable behavior.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
If a child goes to school

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and, accordingly,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
he is encouraged for good grades,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
for additional tasks that he does,

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
he likes to study.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
If a child is forced to go to school,

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
which he does not want,

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
then, accordingly,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
the unfortunate 11 years that we spend in school

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
because we do not do what we need,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
but we are forced to do,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
this is a so-called negative reinforcement,

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
or an aversive one.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
And a little later we will talk about this.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
As for behaviorism and the learning process,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Skinner not only introduced

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
such a type of learning as operative behavior,

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
based on the expected consequences,

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
but also paid a lot of attention to the analysis of

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
the existing modes of reinforcement and punishment,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
the existing modes of assistance

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
in the development of one or another behavior,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
such as accuracy, scrupulosity,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
responsibility, pedanticity,

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
accurate implementation of bureaucratic frameworks.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
And what are the ways that will allow us

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
to prevent the manifestation of undesirable behavior?

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Delay,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
lack of interest in work,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
sitting at work,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
unwillingness to work,

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
formal attitude to work, and so on.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
That is, all those problems that arise in any person

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
in his daily work,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
because work takes up most of our life,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
perhaps even more than sleep.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
So, what types,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
what modes of reinforcement does Skinner give?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
This is very important,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
because Skinner was essentially an operationalist.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
All his work, all his achievements,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
they are so good that the structure of the operation

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
that must be performed is always prescribed

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
in order to get the desired result.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Despite all the abundance of possible modes of reinforcement,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
you can see two main types.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
One type of reinforcement is related to time.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
After I have made a certain reaction,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
a certain consequence occurs,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
and accordingly, it is necessary to wait a certain time

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
for this consequence to occur.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
If, after this time,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
the consequence does not occur,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
then the behavior is not reinforced.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
If, after a certain time,

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
a certain consequence occurs,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
then the behavior is reinforced and fixed.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
This is the so-called temporary reinforcement,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
when the criterion is time.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
After a certain reaction is made,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
it takes some time for any event to occur.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
And the second type of reinforcement,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
the so-called proportional reinforcement,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
is when a certain reaction is made,

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
and a certain number of consequences must occur after it.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
For example, if I do not be late for work,

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
but I come on time,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
it will mean that I will be set an example to others,

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
I will be on a good score,

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
I will be awarded with prizes for the performance discipline,

41:51.000 --> 41:57.000
I will be given a notice for further personnel promotion,

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
and so on.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
So, the reaction is one, I come on time.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
But there can be several consequences of this reaction.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
This is proportional reinforcement.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Again, this is a very important point,

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
because it is connected with the necessary amount of effort

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
that must be applied to a person

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
in order to achieve the desired result in an operant way,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
in a behavioral way.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
When we talk about motivation,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
this is a direct example.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
We have increased the salary.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
Is this enough to increase the efficiency of our employees?

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
Or not?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
How much should we increase the salary?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Should the whole team be increased?

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Should we introduce a system of fines?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Should we introduce a progressive scale

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
or a premium scale?

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
These are numerous questions

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
that are connected with a certain amount of reactions

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
to the same behavioral action.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Why do we spend so much time on reinforcement?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
All these types of reinforcement,

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
both temporal and proportional,

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
are directly connected with our business behavior.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Behavior during negotiations,

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
successful negotiations,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
behavior in communication,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
psychological climate in the team.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
All this is a behavior of a person.

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
And depending on the reinforcement that we receive,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
a certain behavior is formed,

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
certain reactions are formed,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
certain ways of communication are formed.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
People in the team,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
subordinates and managers,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
managers of the same level,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
that is, the horizontal and vertical levels.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Of course, Skinner, as we have already said,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
was not limited only to reinforcements.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Skinner understood perfectly

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
that behaviorists are generally based on experience.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
These are people who work with common sense.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
Why do behaviorists have a lot of results?

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Behaviorists observe events,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
observe the facts that happen in our everyday life

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
and try to justify these facts,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
to highlight from them any components

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
that we need to improve

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
or that we need to get rid of.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
If we talk about improvement,

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
it is reinforcement.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
But, of course, there are a huge number of behavioral reactions

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
that we would like to get rid of.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
I'm not talking about smoking,

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
alcohol consumption,

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
we are talking about the business environment.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
For example, we need to get rid of

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
negligent attitude to work,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
from being late,

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
from the rays that occur in employees,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
from very long lunches,

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
from long absence at work,

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
from frequent overdoses.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Any of you will give a lot of examples

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
of those or other poetic reactions

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
that do not please employees.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
We will not consider the question

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
whether these reactions are really bad,

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
whether they really need to be changed.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
We assume that there is a leader

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
and there are his subordinates.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
The leader is not satisfied with something

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
and he wants his displeasing behavior

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
to be changed.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Skinner says that all this can be achieved

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
by means of punishment.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Speaking of punishment,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Skinner uses the term

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
of an aversive stimulus.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Aversive is unpleasant, painful.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
If reinforcement is what we want,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
then aversion is what we do not want.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
We do not want to be stabbed,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
we do not want to be cold,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
we do not want to be deprived of bonuses,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
we do not want to be constantly reworked.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
All these aversive stimuli

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
work on a person,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
they constantly function on a person.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Any of us will say that

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
there is something he wants

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
and there is something he does not want

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
but he has to make up with.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
These are aversive stimuli.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
As for these stimuli,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Skinner proposes the idea

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
of an aversive control

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
or control of unpleasant,

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
unacceptable stimuli.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
This control is, from his point of view,

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
punishment and negative reinforcement.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
As for punishment,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
it is a kind of a combination

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
of the influence on a person

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
that is aimed at the development

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
of the desired behavior.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
If you are late for work,

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
I can first make a comment to you.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
This is a comment,

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
this is a punishment.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Moreover, it will be a positive punishment

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
for Skinner, because in this case

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I am achieving the desired behavior.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
A person may not like it,

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
he wants to sleep,

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
he does not want to go to work at all,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
but there are certain behavior rules,

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
there are certain behavior conditions

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
in the environment,

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
in my business environment where I am.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Therefore, you must obey these rules.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
I made a comment to you,

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
you are late again,

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
I made a complaint to you,

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
you are late again,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
I am depriving you of a bonus,

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
you are late again,

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
I am depriving you of a bonus.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
You don't need to jump right away.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
You don't need to fire right away.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
A person has his own desires,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
his own needs,

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
his own ways of reacting.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
And he should bring them

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
in accordance with those

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
that are adopted in that environment,

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
in that company,

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
where he works.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
The meaning of a positive punishment

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
is the cessation of

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
undesirable behavior.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
In fact, this is the most negative

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
reinforcement of what we are talking about.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Well, it cannot be said

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
that this is an undesirable form of control.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Maybe, from our point of view,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
when this punishment is applied

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
to us from the boss's side,

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
this is bad.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
But remember how we behave with children.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
If a child runs across the street

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
on the street,

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
he will be punished.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
But if a child runs across the street

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
on the street,

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
he will be punished.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
If a child runs across the street

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
on the street,

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
we punish him.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
For his own good,

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
he should remember

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
that he is on the street

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
and that you should cross it

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
for your own safety

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
on the green light.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
If a child runs across the street

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
in front of a nearby vehicle,

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
we will punish him too

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
because he is in danger.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
He does not yet understand

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
how our goal

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
is to get a positive reinforcement.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
We can encourage him

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
to cross the street

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
on the green light.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
But still,

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
this behavior,

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
the same street,

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
is a result of the conditions

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
that are quite extreme.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
We do not have time

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
for a long-term reinforcement.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
We need to create a quick reaction.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
This is why the punishment is applied.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
But,

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
in addition to a positive punishment,

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
the goal is to

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
ensure a person's safety.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
The goal is to

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
try to create

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
the necessary skills

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
for him to function

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
at his workplace.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
There is a negative punishment.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
The goal is

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
to eliminate

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
any stimulus

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
that causes

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
this behavior.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
The goal is

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
to create

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
a positive reinforcement.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
This is a punishment

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
for the wrong behavior.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
We all know

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
that it is not good

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
to deceive,

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
but we deceive.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
We all know

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
that if you promised

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
to do something

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
at a certain time,

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
you should do it.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
But you do not.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
There are many reasons

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
that are more important

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
than the punishment.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
The negative punishment

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
is to cut

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
off

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
unwanted behavior.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
The negative punishment

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
is to fire you.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
The negative punishment

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
is

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
to not give recommendations

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
to the employee

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
who left you

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
because he was

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
incompetent

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
and had

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
negative personal qualities.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
This is a negative punishment.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
The employee

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
did something wrong,

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
gave the documents to the competitors,

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
made constant conflicts

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
inside the team,

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
violated the psychological

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
limits of the team.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
In fact,

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
we are punishing

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
not to change

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
the behavior,

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
as in a positive case,

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
but to get rid

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
of the employee

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
who is not

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
doing his job.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
In this case,

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
we are talking

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
about the elimination,

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
stopping,

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
copying of the behavior

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
that does not suit us.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
As for the negative behavior,

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
its goal is to limit

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
the aggressive stimuli

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
that this behavior

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
causes and

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
to limit the behavior

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
that is not needed.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
When we talk

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
about the motivation system,

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
the punishment system

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
also has a significant

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
meaning.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
On the one hand,

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
fines can be a positive punishment

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
if it is adequate

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
to the action.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
If its goal

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
is that

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
other ways of

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
influencing the employee

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
are not

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
promising,

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
then the question arises

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
about the person's

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
responsibility.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
But the same fines

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
can be negative.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
A person can be late

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
for work

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
for a reason.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
A child is sick,

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
a car is broken,

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
in the end,

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
he left work late yesterday

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
to perform certain actions,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
and he is not

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
responsible for the actions

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
that he did.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
If this action

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
is not punishable

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
according to the motives

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
that were used,

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
then we kill the initiative

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
of the employee.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Then we force

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
the employee

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
to change his attitude

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
and move from

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
informal attitude

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
to formal attitude.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
We do not step

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
to the right or left.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
When we talk about punishment,

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
it should be differentiated.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
It can kill the initiative

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
and make

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
the risk

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
that I have

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
more accurate.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
This is

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
what the punishment

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
system is about.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
We have already

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
talked about

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
the fact that

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
the punishment

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
is aimed at

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
the development,

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
support,

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
and strengthening

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
of the desired behavior.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
There is a punishment

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
aimed at

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
eliminating

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
the behavior

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
that is not needed.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Skinner

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
found a very good

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
and detailed study

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
of these processes

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
and found

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
that the perpetrator

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
and he himself

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
had a significant influence

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
on the formation

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
of different business models.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
This is how

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
we can characterize

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
the behavioral approach,

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
define and indicate

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
the direction of its development,

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
applicability,

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
and importance,

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
where it is effective,

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
and effective quickly.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
These are the characteristics,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
the ways of influencing

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
our behavior,

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
which often allow

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
to come

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
and get

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
quick results.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
I don't think

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
that a person should

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
constantly lose bonuses

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
in order to realize

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
that he is doing something wrong.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
If a person continues

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
to do something wrong,

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
then it is worth thinking

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
about the task

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
that is put before him.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
The advantage of the behavioral approach

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
is its speed.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
All the trainings

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
based on the behavioral approach,

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
all the methods of learning

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
formulated here,

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
are characterized by

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
the fact that these are

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
quick and stable results.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
But as for the behavioral learning,

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
there is a significant minus.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
This minus is

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
in the specifics

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
of the behavior.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Skinner was an operationalist,

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
as I have already said.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
He produced a specific reaction

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
to a specific stimulus.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Has this stimulus changed?

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Has a company

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
moved from one office

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
to another?

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
People got used

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
to one office.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
They knew where

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
and who was located,

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
where and what was done,

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
and their behavior skills

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
were brought to

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
the level of automaticity

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
in this particular office.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
They knew where to put

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
a specific document,

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
how to put

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
a signature on a document.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
They got used to it.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
If a company moved

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
from one office to another,

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
it was simply because

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
it was a new office,

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
it had a different layout,

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
and it was the same

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
established system.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
They needed to adapt

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
to it again.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
In this sense,

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
both the plus and minus

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
of the behavioral approach

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
are present.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
It is situational,

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
it brings all actions

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
to the level of automaticity.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
But if external circumstances

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
change in the behavioral approach,

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
as I have already said,

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
the external circumstances

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
change,

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
we need the same behavior.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Behavior requires something else.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Circumstances change.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Therefore,

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
any external excuse

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
necessarily leads

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
to a change in behavior,

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
to a change in the operational

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
conditions that were there,

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
to a change in the automatisms

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
that exist.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
A person, as we have already

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
said, is so organized

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
that he always strives

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
to adhere to what he already

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
knows, what has already

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
justified itself.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
And in this regard,

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
any new thing for him,

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
not that it is undesirable,

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
in order to change

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
something,

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
you need to make an effort.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
It is always easier for me

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
to return to what I already

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
know, it is always easier for me

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
to return to what has already

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
proven its effectiveness or

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
ineffectiveness.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
How to get rid of

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
telebolic problems?

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
All accountants know that

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
they submit half-yearly

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
and annual reports

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
twice a year.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
And, accordingly,

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
a month before that,

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
they sit and count everything

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
until late.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
This is a well-known thing.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
If we,

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
as always,

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
did not postpone all the necessary

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
actions, all the papers,

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
and, finally,

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
the preparation of quarterly,

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
half-yearly,

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
annual reports,

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
we would do everything

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
as it should be done,

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
we would not have to sit

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
for a month without leaving the papers.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Everyone knows this,

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
but it still happens.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
This is a habit,

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
and, accordingly,

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
if we say that it is a quarterly

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
or annual report,

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
it is obvious to everyone

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
that it is not always positive.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
But it is a habit,

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
and it is almost everywhere.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
As you can see,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the behavioral approach,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
on the one hand,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
is very successful

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
in terms of speed,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
but, on the other hand,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
it is rigid and tough.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
If something needs to be changed,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
we need to restart the scheme

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
for the same reaction

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
of either operant or

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
component training.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
This is natural.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Theoreticians and practitioners

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
thought about it.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Is it possible to somehow

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
facilitate this process?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
The supporters of Skinner

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
did a huge number of experiments,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
collected data,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
analyzed it,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
but, still,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
the very original scheme,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
the original scheme of behaviorism,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
the stimulus, the reaction,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
what you can see on the slide,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
was the basic scheme

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
that operated in behaviorism

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
until the 50s,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
60s of the last century.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Behaviorists,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I remind you,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
came from the fact

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
that we can observe behavior,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
behavior is an objective thing.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I can mention

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
the time you spend

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
on a particular action,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I can see

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
the speed of your actions,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I can see

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
the direction

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
you are going,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
where you are shifting something,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and assess what you are doing successfully,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
what is not successful,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
develop the desired

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
ways of behavior,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
teach you by them,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
and, accordingly,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
if you do not look for

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
the paper you always need

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
in the depths of your table,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
where you have a huge mess,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
but you spend a day

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
to sort out your table,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
and then put all these papers

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
in order,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
you will not look for them,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
you will know where the necessary

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
paper is.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
That is the stimulus, the reaction.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
All this can be done.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And, again,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
as I have already pointed out,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
behaviorists

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
did not address

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
the person,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
the psyche of the person.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
There is behavior,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
there is tone,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
which can be seen objectively.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
In the mid-50s,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
behaviorists,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
again, we have only talked about behaviorists,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
we have thought about

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
that, in principle,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
the scheme of stimulus and reaction

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
has already been developed,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and, indeed,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
after Skinner's work,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
it has been examined,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
analyzed from all sides.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
But in the mid-50s,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
in the middle of the last century,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
a different question arose.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
All the experiments,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
which behaviorists do,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
were experiments on animals.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The same behaviorists,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I emphasize, behaviorists,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
that is, supporters of the behavioral approach,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
have thought about it.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Well, good.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Still,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I would like to turn to practice

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and draw attention to the obvious fact

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
that in addition to external stimuli,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
which act on a person

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
from the environment,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
no matter how they act,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
respondent stimulus-reaction,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
or operant stimulus-reaction,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and I, according to its consequences,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
assess how I should behave,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
a person still has

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
an inner world.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Here is some kind of cognitive,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
cognitive,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
cognitive processes.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Still,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
we cannot assume

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
that these processes

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
have no effect

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
on human behavior.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Skinner, by the way,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
did not think so either.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Skinner, according to Osler,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
assumed that we cannot get into a person

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and study scientifically objectively the psyche.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So let's study objectively what we can.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Behavior.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
When we get to the psyche,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
so that we can study it objectively,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
measure it,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
assess it,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
indicate it,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
then we will study it

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
using scientific methods.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The ideal for behaviorists

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
has always been the accuracy of consciousness,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
physics.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
No matter what you know,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
no matter what you don't know,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
if you conduct any physical experiment,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and you conduct it

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
with the same initial data,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
you will always get

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
the same result.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
If you didn't get the same result,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
then you made a mistake somewhere.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And you need to find this mistake.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Behaviorists liked this very much.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
No matter what,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
there is an incentive,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
there is a reaction.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
However,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
in the middle of the last century

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
it became necessary

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
for the same behaviorists

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
to address

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
the human psyche.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
And a paradoxical direction

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
arises.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Cognitive-behavioral.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It seems to be an incompatible function.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Behaviorist of behavior,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
cognition,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
is the psyche.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And here the negative behaviorist

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
of the psyche

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
is connected.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And accordingly,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
a direction appears

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
that tries to measure

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
our cognitive moments

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
by behavioral methods.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And what is introduced

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
is the so-called internal variables.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
What you see on the slide.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
External stimuli

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
affect

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
a person,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
a monkey,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
a higher animal.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
In this case, behaviorists

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
consider the higher animals

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
which have a certain

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
psychological way of processing reality.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Stimuli affect this psyche.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And then from this psyche,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
depending on

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
the processing of this stimulus,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
a reaction appears.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
So,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
the stimulus,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
the internal variables,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
they got the name

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
of the cognitive map

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
after Tolman.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And only then the reaction.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Behavior.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
The difference...

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
What is the difference from the previous scheme?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
The difference is fundamental.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Before, we change only the stimuli

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and get behavior.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
There was a purely mechanical scheme.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I increased the power of the stimulus,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I decreased the power of the stimulus,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I added, increased,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I got an increase,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
a decrease in the reaction.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Direct proportionality,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
direct opposite.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Now the situation changes.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
There are stimuli,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
all the same,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
the most objective stimuli.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
They affect the human psyche.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And the psyche is different for everyone.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
We have different experiences,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
we have different coordination.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And these stimuli

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
affect

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
the psyche

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
of an animal.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And already depending on

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
how this psyche

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
evaluates these stimuli,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
depending on its experience,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
depending on its memory,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
depending on its attention,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
depending on how these stimuli were used,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
depending on those

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
psychological images

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
that the person had,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
depending on the human thinking,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I will have

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
a certain reaction.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The simplest example is

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
an experienced manager

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and a beginner.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
They get

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
the same initial data.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
But if a beginner

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
starts acting

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
according to the general patterns

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
that he was taught,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
then the experienced manager

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
already knows

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
where something will work,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
where something will not work.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
The experienced manager already knows

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
pointless ways

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
that will not lead to

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
the desired result.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And accordingly,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
he saves time

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
by not doing these actions.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Therefore,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
he will achieve the result

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
incomparably faster than a beginner.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And since he achieved the result quickly,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
he has a certain

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
time to do

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
certain sales,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
to provide certain services

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
during a certain time interval.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
This is what the inner variables have.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
In fact, this is an experience,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
the experience that is acquired

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
by an animal and a human

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
based on the fact

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
that they take part

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
in different kinds of actions,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
different kinds of events.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
When an animal

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
is not a human,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
it is a human.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
When we talk about

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
the cognitive behavioral direction,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
it is primarily associated

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
with Albert Bandura

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
and Julian Rotter.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Of course, there were other researchers,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
but since our task

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
is to get acquainted

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
with the main,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
key directions,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
the key figures here

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
are these two figures,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Bandura and Rotter.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
As for Albert Bandura,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
his basic idea

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
that he implemented

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
was that

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
he proposed

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
to build,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
to analyze

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
learning from the point of view

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
of observation.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
What does a person do?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
What does a child do?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
What does a long-sighted manager

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
who came to work do?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
He starts to look

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
at the behavior of other people

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
who do not have

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
similar functions,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
who perform

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
similar actions,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and tries to

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
record

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
the key elements

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
of their behavior

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
that make them successful.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
If I have recorded

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
these elements of behavior,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
then I start

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
to reproduce

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
this behavior.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
And if I have modeled

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
the behavior

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
of a person

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
in a way

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
that I can

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
do it,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
then I can

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
achieve the desired result.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
If I have missed

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
some elements,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
then I can

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
achieve the desired result,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
but not so fast,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
not so good,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
or I will be disappointed

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
and will consider

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
that what I do

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
is inappropriate

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
for community

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
and the society.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
If I have

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
demonstrated

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
a poor skill

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
to someone

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.240
then I'm

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
not a good person.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
If I have

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
done

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
my best

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
for my country,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
my community,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
this black box

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
starts to behave.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
It's a passive object

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
with an external influence

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and reaction.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Bandoora makes a completely different situation.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Bandoora from a human

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
makes an active,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
acting being.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Because

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
these inner variables

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
these cognitive maps

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
are my observations.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I'm stimulated.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I activate my memory.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I activate my existing experience.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I activate my systematic observation.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And I try to get the desired result.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
If I don't get the result

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
or if I don't get the result

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
that I want

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
then I myself

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
without changing my behavior

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I'm not a human being.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I'm a black box.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I'm a black box.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I'm a black box.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I'm a black box.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I try to change the external interference.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I'm trying

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
to build a different model.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
If I can't change it

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Iasons the options.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But the stimuli

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
doesn't change.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
A monthus plan before me.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And how going to implement it

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
is my choice.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
There is only one reaction.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
The plan is here.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I got it in the first...

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
in the next month.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I have to take account in implementing the plans.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
The reaction is the same.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
But the achievement of the reaction

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
can be different.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And here

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
my internal variables

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
are

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
that I

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
take

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
those

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
behavior models

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
that will allow me

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
to get

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
the desired result

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
more successfully.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Increase it

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
in the same stimuli

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
to be more successful.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And then build

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
the desire

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
about the career growth,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
material stimulation,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
non-material stimulation

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
and so on.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
The main

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
advantage of behaviorism

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
is the operationalism.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It's not enough to say

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
just observe and build the models.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
It's not enough.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
The success of behaviorism

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
as we have already mentioned

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
about Skinner

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
is that

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
he develops the specifics,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
develops the operating system.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And Bandura

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
is famous not only for the fact

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
that he came up with the idea

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
of learning by observing and modeling

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
the successful behavior.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
A very productive idea

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
that has found a great application

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
and we will talk about it today.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
But Bandura

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
built the operating system,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
built the variable system

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
that described

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
how to learn successfully,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
how to organize the learning

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
successfully by observing.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
As for behaviorism,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
the scheme is different in simplicity.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's also a plus of the behavioral approach.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
They build very complex

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
multilayered schemes

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
that are difficult to understand.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And that's what modern

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
cognitivists often fail.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
They have very beautiful schemes

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
that take up

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
huge sheets of Watman

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
and to understand something

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
you need to make a lot of effort.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
The schemes of behaviorists

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
are simple,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
they are clear,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
they correspond to common sense.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Bandura divides only four variables

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
that will influence

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
the observation.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And these variables

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
are, let's say,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
understandable to common sense.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
These are the variables

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
that any living being

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
and human and animal face.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
The first of these variables

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
is attention.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Every human,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
every animal

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
has such a mental function

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
as attention.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Out of all the abundance of stimuli,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
out of all the abundance of events

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
that exist in the world

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
that I live in,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
that affect me,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
based on my experience,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
based on the power of stimuli,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I focus my attention

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
only on a certain number of events.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
We said that

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
a person

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
can consciously

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
work only

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
with a measured number,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
7 plus or minus 2

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
is 7.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And this is a very good thing.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
So, we can

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
simultaneously

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
consciously

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
focus our attention

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
on 5 to 9 objects.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
If we have more than 9 objects,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
then our attention

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
is dispersed

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and we miss something

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
in the sphere of attention.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
This is how a person works.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It is pointless to talk about

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
the importance of attention

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
here.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
It is academic debate.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
If you are interested,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
you can read

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
the books

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
that are recommended to you.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
There are possible hypotheses

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
of such a process.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
From the point of view of practice,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
we are interested

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
in the problem

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
that a person is

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
evolutionarily

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
organized

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and has a certain

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
mental state.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Our brain

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
can consciously

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
focus our attention

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
on 5 to 9 objects.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Someone has 6,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
someone has 7.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
This is normal.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
This does not mean

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
that we can see only up to 9 objects.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
We can see more objects,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
but if we pay attention

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
to other objects,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
we do it because

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
the previous events

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
are not in the sphere of our attention.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Therefore,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
when I observe,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I should know

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
why I observe.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
This is the first factor of success.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
If I can identify

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
significant factors of observation,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
then,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
in this case,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I really

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
am able

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
to build

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
an adequate model.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I know

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
why I observe.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And, accordingly,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I know what to model.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
You can model a hairstyle,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
you can model shoes,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
you can model a watch,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
you can model glasses,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you can model a handkerchief

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
in your pocket.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Of course,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
the appearance

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
has a significant influence,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
but this is not always

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
the principled

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
way

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
of working.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
We should be able

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
to build

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
a model

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
that is

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
effective

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and professional.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
If we focus

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
on the appearance,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
we cannot pay attention

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
to the phone calls

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
that are made,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
to the e-mails

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
that are written,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
to the methods of work

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
that are used

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
to make

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
a plan.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
We only pay attention

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
to the suit,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
tie,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
shoes,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
and so on.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
We have focused

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
our attention

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
on insignificant

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
signs.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
We can dress up

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
as we want.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
We can be dressed up

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
as a model,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
a movie star,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
an artist,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
but we won't become

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
neither Banderas

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
nor Angelina Jolie.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
So, this is attention.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
The second

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
important factor

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
that we need

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
to build

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
a successful model

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
as a result of observation

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
is the preservation

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
of the memory.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
As for our memory,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
there are arguments

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
about the limited

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
memory,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
but we don't care about

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
these arguments.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Any of us knows

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
that we can't always

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
remember what we need

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
at the moment.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
In this situation,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
there is a problem

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
that is related

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
to the need

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
to remember.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
A person

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
remembers a lot

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
of facts

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
and events during his life.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But it's not enough

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
to remember.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
You need to have

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
access to these events.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Many of you remember

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
that when we were

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
in our wonderful

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
student years,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
we took out

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
all the information

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
we needed.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
It's the same here.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
We can be called

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
to the head

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
to get a report

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
on what we did

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
during the week.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Many companies

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
have a weekly report

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
on their actions.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
We are called

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
to do something else.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
We think about

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
the same business plan

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
but we don't remember

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
what we did.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
The head

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
gets the impression

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
that I'm a lazybones

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and that I'm

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
too materialistic

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and too perspective.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Then we leave

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
and think

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
why didn't I

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
say this or that

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
and I won't

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
come back.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
The problem

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
is not to remember

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
but to remember

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
what you need

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
in the right moment

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
in the right time

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
in the right conditions.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
In other words,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
if I

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
face the same situation

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
where I'm

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
successful

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
in my business

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
and I'm successful

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
in my career

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
and I'm successful

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
in my business

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I need to remember

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
his behavior

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
in similar situations

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
not in the way

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
he talks to his boss

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
or how he dresses

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
or how he flirts

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
or flirts.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
But there are

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
other processes

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
that come to mind.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Therefore,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
in order to

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
remember and have access

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
to those events

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
to those tasks

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
that arise

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
in a successful model

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
that I model

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
in solving the same tasks

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
that are in front of me.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
The third component

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
that Bandura highlights

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
in his approach

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
to learning

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
through observation

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
is

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
motor processes

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
and motor-reproductive processes.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
In fact,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
despite the

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
complicated name

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
it's a very simple thing.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I see

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I remember

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I focused my attention

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
on the behavior of the model.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I can draw it.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
But

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
several conditions have changed.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I need to be able

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
to apply

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
to remember

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
the behavior of the model

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
in such a way

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
that it corresponds

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
to the changed conditions

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
that exist.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Again,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
it's a very simple situation.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
We can observe

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
how a successful manager

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
gives instructions

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
to other managers

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
that are subordinate to him.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
How does he organize their work?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
If we

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
start giving instructions

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
to other managers

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
instead of him

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
in the absence of a manager

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I think

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
we will get

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
a not so clear reaction

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
because our status

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
does not correspond

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
to our behavior.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
He can lead

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
because other managers

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
are in the same position.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
He is authoritative.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
He knows

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
what to do

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
and how to do it.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
His status

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
corresponds to his behavior.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Ours does not.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
If we just

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
reproduce

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
a certain behavior

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
and monkey it

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
not because we want to

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
but because we see

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
how a person interacts

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
with others

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
and we think

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
that if we behave

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
we will get

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
the same results.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
That's right.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
We can reproduce

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
gestures,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
facial expressions,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
even voice parodies

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
but

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
we have different statuses.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
That's why

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
a mirrored motor

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
reproductive process

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
in our performance

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
is more valuable

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
than the natural processes

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
that come from

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
a status manager.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
By the way,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
it's obvious

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
but remember

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
how often

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
you had to see

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
such reactions

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and how often

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
it was funny

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
because you understood

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
why a person does it

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
and what it leads to

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
and what it doesn't.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And finally

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
the fourth

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
characteristic

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
of the observation

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
is the motivational processes.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
A person's motivation.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And here

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
we should say

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
that Bandura

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
in this point

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
is far from

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
traditional behavioral approaches.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Behaviorists

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
don't consider

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
motivational processes.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Motivation is the reason

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
for a person's behavior.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So, the behaviorists

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
had a simple motivation.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
The stimulus-reaction

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
is the motivation

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
that makes a person

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
do what he does.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That's all.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
There was a clear motivation.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
A person

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
was affected

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
by external factors.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I was asked to report.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I had to report

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
on my expenses

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
and I did

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
the right thing.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
That's the motivation.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Bandura

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
talks about motivation

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
in the psychological sense of the word.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
A person has

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
internal variables

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and a person's motivation

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
is not only

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
connected with external stimuli.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Here Bandura

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
talks about

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
objectivity.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
External stimuli are active.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
But

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
how I will react,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
what will be the real reasons

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
for my behavior

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
are determined by my internal

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
cognitive map,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
my internal variables.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
That's the I

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
in the scheme

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
that concerns

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
the cognitive behavioral approaches.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
And, therefore,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
there is a punishment.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
But,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
and this is the main difference

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
with Skinner

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
or radical behaviorism.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
If the punishment

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
for Skinner

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
was the punishment

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and reinforcement from the outside,

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Bandura talks about

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
self-reinforcement

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
and self-punishment

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
and self-regulation.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
A person

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
is interested in

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
animals.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Bandura was a behaviorist,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
so he didn't deal

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
with one person.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
He was interested in the whole

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
psychological range.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
A person becomes an active being

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
and the reason for his behavior

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
is not in the outside.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
The outside is an external factor.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
It is inside a person.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
This was the most fundamental

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
departure from behaviorism.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
And here it is clear

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
that in the cognitive behavioral approach

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
all the cognitive

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and motivational processes

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
are launched.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And now, in order to understand

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
how and why a person acts,

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
we need to address

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
his motives,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
emotions,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
desires, needs.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Although, of course,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Bandura in this case

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
also does not depart from behaviorism.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
We should address them

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
in order to reinforce

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
the desired operant behavior.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I behave in order to get

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
the desired results for me.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Depending on the results

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I get,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I modify my behavior.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
But I do it.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I, a person,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
become active.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And now

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
the spectrum,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
the center of a person's behavior

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
is transferred from the outside to the inside.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
This was really

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
a kind of

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
a return to behaviorism

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
of the inner world of a person.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
This is what

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
led to

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
the elimination

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
of behaviorism

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
and to the beginning

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
of Watson's behaviorism.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But Bandura, again,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
tries to make

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
these motivational processes

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
tangible,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
visible,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and perceptible.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
At the same time,

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
just like Skinner,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
he does not stop

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
at the selection of

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
these components

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and introduces

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
the concept of indirect reinforcement

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
and such an important factor

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
as self-effectiveness.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
The ineffectiveness

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
of a person's behavior

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
is a very important factor.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
The ineffectiveness of a person's behavior,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
which we see from the outside,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
is the assessment of

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
the effectiveness

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
of one's own behavior.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Again,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
no one else assesses

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
how effective you are,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
which is typical for behaviorism.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
But a person himself assesses

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
how effective he is

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
and how to increase

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
his effectiveness.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
A person punishes himself

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
if he fails

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and he reinforces himself

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
if he has succeeded.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
As for

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
indirect reinforcement,

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
in fact,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
indirect reinforcement

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
is an observation

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
of the behavior of the model.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Let's recall Skinner's reinforcement.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
It was necessarily external.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
There is an external stimulus,

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I behave,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
and my reinforcement

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
is the result

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
of my achievement.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
If I get

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
the desired result,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
it is a reinforcement

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
of the desired behavior.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Bandura has a different situation.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I look at the behavior of the model

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
and I see

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
that in some situations

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
the model is more successful

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
than in others.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Some actions

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
of the model

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
are more successful

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
than others.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
And I begin to realize

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
from the entire model behavior

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
these successful forms of behavior.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
I reinforce myself

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
by observing the model.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I haven't done anything yet.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I mean,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I don't have a result yet

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
with its consequences

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
in order to reinforce my behavior.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I see that if the model

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
did such and such actions,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
it got the desired result

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
with the desired consequences.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I begin to reinforce

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
not by my behavior,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
but only by observing

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
the behavior of the model.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
This is indirect reinforcement.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Not directly, but indirectly.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
This is not my behavior,

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
this is the behavior of the model,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
and I only observe its success.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And then I try to reproduce it.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I don't know yet if I will succeed.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I can copy the model

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
one by one

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
with the suit, glasses,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
hairstyle, and so on,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
and remain unsuccessful.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
But this indirect reinforcement

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
will later require

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
real reinforcement

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
from my results.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
But first, these are the results

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
that I see in the model.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And then

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
my successes

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
will be reflected

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
from the point of view

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
of my own assessment

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
of the effectiveness

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
of my behavior.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I do not assess my experiences.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
This is not present

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
in the cognitive behavioral approach.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I, again, assess the result

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
of my behavior.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
But I do it myself

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
by the reinforcement,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
as we talked about.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Moreover, again,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
the reinforcement highlights

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
four fundamental elements

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
that allow

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
to increase

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
the effectiveness of a person,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
that is, to increase

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
his own opinion

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
about himself.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
This has not yet been in behaviorism.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
A person begins

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
to assess himself.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And from the point of view of Bandura,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
a person can assess himself

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
objectively,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
not passionately,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
we all know that we are the best,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
but objectively,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
we are the worst.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
If he really will come from

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
four criteria,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
which Bandura highlighted.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
The first criterion is

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
the ability of a person

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
to build

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
observable behavior.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
There is a model,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I highlighted it with attention,

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I kept its behavior in my memory,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
but now I need

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
to reproduce this work.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Everyone gets it in different ways.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Someone

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
parodies Pugachev,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Kabzon,

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
but nevertheless he does not become

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Pugachev or Kabzon,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
he becomes a parodist.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
In this regard,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
again, how effective behavior

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I will build

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
to be not a parodist,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
but a specialist,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
who will be appreciated

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
no less than the model

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I am focused on.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
The second criterion

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
of the most effective

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
is the presence of

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
indirect experience.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Not indirect reinforcement,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
but indirect experience.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Indirect experience is

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
not directly related

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
to my behavior,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
but it is a

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
coexisting experience.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
There is a basic experience

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
that I get by doing

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
these or those actions.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And here I get the result.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
But in addition to this result,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
I get respect

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and respect.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I get

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
those or those labels

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
conflict,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
non-conflict,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
cooperative,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
competitive.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
That is,

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
every result,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
in addition to the desired consequences,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
has another consequence.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And these consequences

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
are also very important

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
for assessing me

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
as an effective specialist,

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
for being able to pay attention,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
to be able to notice

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
not only the results of behavior,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
but also the results

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
that are associated with it.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
The third criterion

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
of the most effective

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
is verbal offense.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
This concerns

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
only a person.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Only,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
in any case,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
as we know now,

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
we will not go into different

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000
esoteric experiences

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
of language

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
possession.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
This is only a person.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And, accordingly,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
if we are talking about a person,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
then

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I can

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
verbally,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
cognitively,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
make up one or another

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
idea about my actions,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
give myself an assessment,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
express the level of my effectiveness

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
in words.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Again, this is a very significant

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
criterion of the most effective

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
is verbal offense.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Because before this,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
people did not pay attention

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
to speech at all.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Speech for them was just

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
a thought spread out in the ear.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Purely a bichloral approach.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
We think,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
we want to convey our thoughts

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
to another person.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And speech is just

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
an articulation of our thoughts.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
The situation with Bandura

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
changes fundamentally.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
The fact that I am a professional,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
that my achievements

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
are worthy of being

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
reproduced,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
worthy of self-respect,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
in fact,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
this is a self-assessment

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
given to a person.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Am I successful in life?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Am I unsuccessful?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Am I successful

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
in perceiving the behavior of a model?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Whether I am modeling a model,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
will I become

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
the same person

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
for someone else

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
as I am modeling

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
for myself today?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
This is a verbal offense.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
These are the cognitive and

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
thought structures

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
that are characteristic of a person.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
And the fourth criterion,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
again,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
is not characteristic of bichlorism,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
but is inherent in Bandura.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
This is an emotional reinforcement.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
No one has ever talked about

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
emotions before Bandura

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
in bichlorists.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
It is obvious that

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
if a person is on an emotional rise,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
if he is happy,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
he is very happy.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
If he achieves great results

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
where he would not have achieved them

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
in ordinary words,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
if he is depressed,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
if he is upset,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
if something is wrong with him,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
then those actions,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
those reactions

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
that were not difficult for him

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
to do yesterday,

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
what he did on the machine,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
he does not want to do it.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
It is because

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
he is not in the mood.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
A person is a living creature.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
For us, this is a natural statement.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
But for bichlorists

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
this statement was shocking.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
It was emotions

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
that Otsun was avoiding

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
when creating bichlorism.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
It was emotions that Bandura came to.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
When creating a cognitive-bichlorian approach,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
he realized

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
that if we want

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
to build a model of human behavior,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
we cannot take away

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
from a person his subjectivity.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
These are the four criteria

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
with which Bandura

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
believed

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
that a person

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
is able to objectively

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
assess his self-effectiveness.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
we have considered

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
the approach to the bichlorists' training.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
We have looked at the changes

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
that were made to the bichlorian theory

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
by Bandura.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
But let's pay attention

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
to the following fact.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
What is the principle similarity

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
between Skinner

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and Bandura,

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
the approach that is fundamentally different

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
from Skinner's approach?

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Both of them

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
consider a person

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
as a person.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
A person is one.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
A person behaves in a certain way,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
interacts with a person.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
At the same time,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
if Skinner's behavior

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
is related to

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
external activity

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
on a person,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Bandura

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
transfers the center of consideration

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
inside a person,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and external activity

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
moves from a person

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
to outside.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
External activity can affect a person,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
but the main thing is

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
that if a person is affected

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
by external activity,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
then another obvious fact

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
related to human behavior

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
is left out.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
The fact,

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
again,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
in line with common sense,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
is that a person

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
is a fundamentally social creature.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
That is,

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
a person lives among other people,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
and other people assess

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
a person's behavior.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
A person strives to do something

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
in order to achieve

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
a certain place

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000
in the social hierarchy

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
that has been created.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Any behavior of a person

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
is oriented to the reaction of other people.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
A person is a fundamentally social creature.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Again, the idea of Aristotle,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
and Aristotle also said

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
that a person is a social animal.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
But,

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
it seems that

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
such a fact

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
has not yet been included

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
in the behaviorist's consideration.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And, in principle,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
it was not important

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
for the behaviorists

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
of Skinner's logic.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Other people

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
were concerned with external social factors

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
that affect a person.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
This is one of the external factors,

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
and there was no need

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
to separate them for some reason.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Bandura

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
approached the need

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
to take into account other people

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
almost directly.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
But in this regard,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
he did not take into account

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
the social behavior of a person.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Although, of course,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
he made a lot of effort

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
to analyze the social behavior of a person,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
but it was not the main thing for him.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
As for

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
the inclusion

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
of the cognitive-behavioral approach

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
of the socium,

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
it is the merit

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
that is associated

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
with another significant figure

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
of the approach,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Julian Rotter.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Of course,

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
he was a supporter

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
of the idea of Bandura's approach.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
They live in the same time.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
But Rotter

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
focused his main attention

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
on the fact

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
of the social behavior

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
of a person

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
as a cognitive-behavioral creature.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
At the same time,

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Rotter

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
is the creator

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
of the theory of social learning.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
As for

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
this theory,

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
it is again

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
a theory

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
that is in line

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
with the behavioral approach.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
This theory reflects

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
the fact of the social behavior of a person

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
and, again,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
it solves the operational task.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
As for Rotter,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
he states that

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
the meaning of the study

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
of human behavior

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
is that

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
we could make a forecast.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
This is, again,

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
the basic idea of behaviorism.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
We study people,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
we study animals

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
in order to be able to predict

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
how they will behave.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
In fact,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Bandura asks a second question.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000
In addition to the question

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
of how to behave,

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Bandura asks a question

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
of why people behave like this.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
And he starts to answer this question.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Rotter continues to look for the answer

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
to the question of why people behave like this.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
And he says that

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000
in addition to learning,

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
modeling,

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
observing,

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
which Bandura mentioned,

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
which is already social in itself,

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
the main fact is that

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
a person in his everyday behavior

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
is guided by other people.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Therefore,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
our task,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
the task of the cognitive behavioral approach

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
is to build a forecast of a person's behavior.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
A forecast of a person's behavior

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
is the task of analyzing

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
the forecast of human behavior

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
in our everyday life.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
But here it should be borne in mind

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
that even with regard to behaviorists,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
they were very careful with words.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Our everyday life is a blurry concept.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Therefore, Rotter introduces the term

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
complex situation,

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
the forecast of human social behavior

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
in complex situations.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
In complex situations,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
from the point of view of multi-stimulant.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
There are a lot of stimuli here.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
First, stimuli of the external world,

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
and secondly,

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
which is much more complicated,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
these are internal stimuli,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
internal variables,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
internal cognitive maps.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Again,

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
as for Rotter,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
he does not stop at this idea.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
He gives a way to solve it.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
How can we objectively,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
and this is still

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
a behavioral methodology.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And here the main thing is

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
that we need to understand

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
and measure,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
we need to analyze,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
we need to calculate.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
So, the question is,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
how can we measure

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
a complex social situation?

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Rotter,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
as well as Bandura,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
when talking about self-effectiveness,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
also highlights

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
four main variables.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Behaviorists have always been looking for

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
those variables that can be measured.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Because if I want to get

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
an objective result,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I need to measure it.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
This is a complete analogue of natural consciousness.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Rotter highlights four variables

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
that need to be measured and studied

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
in order to solve the basic task

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
of building a forecast of human behavior

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
in complex situations.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And as for all the variables of Rotter,

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
these variables

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
are already going completely

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
in line with behaviorism.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Well, after Bandura,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000
it was partly

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
done simply,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
because Bandura was the first

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
to make this subjective path.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Rotter believes

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
that in order to analyze

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
human behavior,

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
we need to know

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
the potential of its behavior.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Look,

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
potential is

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
those possible reasons,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
those possible reasons

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
and those possible results,

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
those possible desires

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
that a person wants to achieve.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I behave,

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I do something,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I act in a certain way

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
in order to achieve some result.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
I have some faith in possibilities.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I can get one result,

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I can get many results,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I can limit myself

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
to a small number of results.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Again,

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
the same question arises here.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
What level of achievement,

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
what level of commitment

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
do I put in order to know

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
how to compare

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
those real achievements

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
that I have.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
But,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
since we are talking about

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
the potential of behavior,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Rotter introduces

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
the following criteria,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
the following variable,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
expectation.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I can set

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
a very high expectation

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
for my behavior.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And thus,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
in fact,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I set my expectations,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000
the prospects

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
that I want to achieve,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
the data that I want to get.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I build a certain goal,

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
a certain vision,

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
a certain belief.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I set a goal for my activity

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
for which

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
these are my internal variables

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
that are influenced

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
by external stimuli

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
that shape my behavior.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Expectations

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
determine where I am going,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
what I am striving for,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
what I want to achieve.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
The next variable

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
that Rotter introduces

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
is the value of reinforcement.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Look,

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Skinner

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
and Bandura

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
all talked about reinforcement

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
in different aspects.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000
But Rotter makes reinforcement

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
clearly subjective.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000
He does not specify

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000
the value of reinforcement.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Why is one

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
or another reinforcement

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
valuable to a person?

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Let's take a manager.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000
For someone,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
material compensation

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
is the only value.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Accordingly,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
everything I do is done

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
to increase my income.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
For someone,

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
the value is

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
acquiring new knowledge,

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
gaining experience,

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
and professional growth.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Salary is important,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
but the main thing for me

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
is getting to know a new field,

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
the opportunity to gain new experience,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
the opportunity to gain professional growth,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
which will later

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
be reflected in salary,

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
but not in salary.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
The main thing is

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
my career and professional development.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Depending on the value

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
that we give to reinforcement,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
there are different priorities.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Reinforcement is a choice of priorities.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
What do we want to get earlier,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
what do we allow to get later,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
what do we not want to get at all.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Punishment.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
In this regard,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Rotter, again,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
makes a person even more subjective.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
In this case,

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
the value of reinforcement

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
is determined not by external data,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
but by the value of each person.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Then this value

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
will be determined

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
by social values.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
And, again,

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
a social interaction will arise.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
There are my values,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
my internal variables.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
As for potential, expectations,

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
values, psychology,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
psychological situation

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
that will be the next variable,

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
this is a list of internal variables.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
What does Rotter do?

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Rotter tries to operationalize

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000
this most inescapable,

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000
immeasurable internal variable,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
cognitive map.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
This value will be related

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
to my internal values.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
And it is related to external values.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000
S.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Accordingly,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000
depending on this ratio,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
there will be different reactions.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
This is the original formula.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Stimulus, internal variable, reaction.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Here it is,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000
the closure that arises here.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
And the fourth variable

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000
is psychological reaction.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
There is a nuance

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
in understanding the psychological situation

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
for Rotter.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Let's not forget

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
that Rotter is a stanobichiarist.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And, accordingly,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
a stanobichiarist

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
in the sense that

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
he requires objectivity.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I will not build a hypothesis,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
as, for example,

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
domestic psychologists

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
from the point of view of the operational approach,

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
where there are only theories

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
and no real results.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
I will not build a hypothesis.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
But

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
every person

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
has his own motives.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Let's recall Bandura.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Every person has his own desires,

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
his own emotions.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
The same Bandura.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
This is the psychological situation.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
There are some additional characteristics.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Not the psyche in the usual understanding

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
of those same cognitivists.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
There are some additional

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
psychological characteristics.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
There are some additional parameters

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
of my inner variable.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Desires,

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
emotions,

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
affections,

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
expectations,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
mistakes,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
needs.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
This is the psychological situation.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Again,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
the principle is

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
what can be measured,

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
what can be justified,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
what can be assessed.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And it is not only assessed

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
by the person himself.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Here the rotor,

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
like Bandura and Skinner,

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
hold the same point of view.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I can think whatever I want about myself.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
And, accordingly,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000
it is pointless to say

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
whether you are right or wrong.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
All these variables

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
are given so that

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I can characterize

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
those inner variables

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
that move a person

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
and through which

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
this external stimulus passes,

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
responsible for the behavior

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000
that arises in a person.
