WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.240
If we look more closely at how we

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.740
work with the entire area of project

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.200
management knowledge, precisely

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.500
from the point of view of the process

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.340
approach, then after we have

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.120
determined, actually, the overall

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.880
content of the project management

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880
process, we can decompose or

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.020
divide into separate

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.080
components by functional

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.720
areas of management the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.220
entire management process.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.020
In other words, we can look

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.280
at the individual components of

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.560
project management in such a way

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.960
that we have a double division

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.520
of all that cube of knowledge

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.600
or project management content.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.340
On the one hand, we divide this cube into

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.760
5 stages of the management process,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.900
and on the other hand, we divide

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.080
it into several functional areas.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.600
Here on the next slide you can see

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.900
an example of dividing the project

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.220
management process

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.320
by functional areas.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.440
This example is taken from the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.380
International Project Management Association

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.920
methodology and in particular

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.200
from the document called International

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.220
Competence Baseline ICB.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.880
And this approach is reflected

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.820
in the national requirements

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.500
of competence of the states that

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.180
are part of the international association

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.780
for project management, including

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.880
the Russian national requirements,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.620
approximately adhere

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.940
to this division in functional

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.800
areas.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.420
If we consider some other national

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.400
standards, such as the US National

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.680
Standard Project Management Body

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.780
of Knowledge, abbreviated PMBOK

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.020
USA, which was developed by the Project

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.920
Management Institute, then

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.280
there is a division of project

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
management of the entire box of this

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.840
is done in such a way that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.980
it is divided into 9 component

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.140
parts.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.960
From the perspective of the realities

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.160
of Russian business and Russian characteristics

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.380
of project management, this approach

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.540
of dividing into 9 parts of the entire

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.780
project management box is not always

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.280
justified, since in the Russian realities

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.580
of project management there

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.160
are separate components

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.840
that do not include these

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.520
9 parts.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.640
Thus, if we apply the 1 in 1 PMI methodology

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.820
of the US, we see that there is

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.520
no full coverage of the project

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.960
management process in our

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.180
Russian specific conditions.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.380
As for the application of the approach

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.320
of the International Project Management

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.120
Association, here we see that the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.560
situation is more systematic

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.160
and more effective for the Russian

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.500
reality of project management.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.140
So, what is the functional

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.860
area of project management?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.660
What is this functional area?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.080
Here on the slide you see that it is

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.360
primarily the management

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.100
of the project area, then the management

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.340
of the project by time parameters,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.300
sometimes they say that time

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.980
management in the project.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.280
But it is more correct to call

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.260
this area project management

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.740
by time parameters.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.280
The next functional area is project

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.080
value management or project

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.860
value analysis, then quality

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.760
management, human resource

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.240
management, project

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.260
interaction management,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.420
risk management, supply

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.780
and contract management,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.000
project safety

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.880
management, change

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.420
management, integration

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.180
management.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.140
And in some individual specific

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.420
cases, other areas of management,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.620
other functional areas are

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.760
used in specific types

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.260
of business.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.980
In our course, we will briefly examine

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.880
all of the above-listed functional

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.120
areas, and we will begin by

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.100
considering the management of

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.040
the project subject area.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.710
The management of the project subject

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.210
area is also understood differently in

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.650
different methodologies, in different

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.250
approaches, but in terms of content

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.250
it is the same.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.310
For example, in the approach of

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.770
the U.S. Project Management Institute,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.950
PMI, PMBOK, this area is called

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.910
project content management.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.510
But in international terminology,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.270
this area is called the management

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.610
of the subject area, well, we will

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.210
stick to this terminology.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.970
In general, this function, this

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.530
functional area can be considered

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.930
as a process of the overall

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.430
project management process.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.130
And then we can take this functional

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.970
area too to break down

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.290
into 5 stages.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.470
The stage of initiation, the stage

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.250
of planning, the stage of organization

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.790
of control of the management of the

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.610
project subject area, analysis

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.510
and regulation and completion of

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.390
the management of the project subject area.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.970
As I said before, any

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.830
functional area of project management

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.130
we will consider

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.170
from this methodological

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.630
point of view.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.730
We divide this functional

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.330
area into 5 stages.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.570
This will allow us to consider

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.840
the overall box as we say, or

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.320
the overall scope of the project

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.960
management discipline in terms

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.080
of dividing it into a

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.620
functional area.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.460
So, let us briefly look at the content

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.940
of the subject area management.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.020
As I said before, the initiation of the

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.120
project begins with the fact that we formulate

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.420
the goal of the project, clarify the goal

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.820
of the project.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.380
At the same time, this process occurs

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.680
not only within the group

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.080
initiating the project, not only

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.580
by one, say, initiator.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.720
But this process extends to all potential

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.260
participants of the project,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.740
individuals and legal entities.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.160
That is, in principle, all

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.200
the steakholders or key participants

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.760
of this future project are still

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.100
taking part in the initiation

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.500
process, more precisely

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.620
in the project management

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.780
process in the management

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.840
of the subject area.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.560
This means that in order to really

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.720
minimize some weaknesses, weaknesses

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.440
of planning the organization

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.300
of the project implementation

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.100
in the subject area, we must first

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.200
of all agree on the purpose

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.900
of the project.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.840
Why is the project needed?

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.880
Who needs him?

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.720
Why is he needed?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.380
What will we get from

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.340
the project?

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.460
What will be the impact of achieving

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.020
the project's objectives?

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.420
All these global strategic issues are

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.580
considered in the first stage of the

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.000
management process of the

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.820
subject area, namely at the initiation

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.360
stage.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.640
Naturally, if we start carefully

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.640
analyzing all expectations, all participants

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.780
of the future project, then we must

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.640
carefully consider, and what

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.340
can be the real motives for the

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.160
participation of these legal entities,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.020
individuals in the project.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.120
This can all be attributed

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.760
to the pre-project analysis, and this is

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.880
also part of the initiation stage.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.780
If we carefully consider what

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.880
are the typical motives of participation

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.980
of different key actors, for example,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.420
the customer and the performer,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.860
then we will see that formally

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.460
they may coincide, and in fact

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.400
they may differ significantly.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.840
Typically, the formal agreement of the

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.860
project's purpose is recorded in

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.540
some documents, for example, in such documents

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.660
as a contract or a contract between

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.040
the customer and the general

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.480
contractor and the contractor.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.680
And in these documents there is a necessarily

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.660
item that fixes that the

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.580
subject of the contract or contract

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.500
is something, something,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.540
something.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.280
At this formal legal level, the

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.260
purpose of the project is

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.820
agreed.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.140
But in addition to the formal agreement

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.000
on the purpose of the project,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.640
we must also conduct an internal, in essence,

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.500
agreement on the purpose of the project

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.680
or the motives of participation, at

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.740
least to study and analyze the different

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.360
motives of participation of different

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.400
team members or individuals and

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.440
legal entities that will participate

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.300
in the project.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.920
Thus, in the stage of initiation of the

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.000
subject area or management of the subject

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.860
area, we must explore what are the

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.500
true internal motives of the

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.540
participation of individuals

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.180
and legal entities in the project.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.200
We have to study this.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.360
This can all be attributed

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.420
to a pre-project survey, as

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.360
I said.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.580
And from this point of view it

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.700
is clear that the typical motives

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.200
for participation in the customer's

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.320
project are reduced to the fact

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.240
that the customer, in essence,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.880
wants to get this product or service

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.440
that meets the requirements of the

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.380
technical task, corresponds

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.940
to the project-related documentation

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.040
on quality, quantity,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.100
on its functions.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.700
It must comply with our planned

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.840
calculations and parameters

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.020
that are present in this

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.320
documentation.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.580
As for the contractor and the

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.580
general contractor, he is not always

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.880
motivated to do so in full, in

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.160
full accordance with the documentation,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
the full list of functions

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.800
and the quality parameters

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.960
of the project, product or service

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.720
results are of interest

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.940
to the general contractor

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.980
or the contractor.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.100
This was often observed in the realities

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.120
of project activities during the

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.680
restructuring, when the

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.280
performer approached formally.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.620
And its main motivation was to

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.160
get the maximum profit with

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.360
the minimum cost.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.020
Here is the typical motivation, participation

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.360
in projects of performers, contractors.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.000
And if I impotify the image of

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.360
the employer, then I have to understand

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.420
with whom I am dealing.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.020
This is the characteristic of project activities.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.320
I need to understand what a project

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.020
is and what a project activity is.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.480
And then it will be easier for me to study, and

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.020
what are the true internal motives of participation

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.280
in the project of the performer.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.980
After examining these circumstances, I

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.240
will formulate the main provisions of the

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.940
contract or contract with this participant

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.720
in a slightly different way.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.960
With the contractor, the contractor, the

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.660
general contractor, the subcontractor

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.320
and so on.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.840
Naturally, in such a situation,

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.840
I pay special attention to clear

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.800
fixation, unambiguous fixation.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.340
The characteristics of the result of the

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.760
project, those parameters that describe

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.240
the product or service.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.960
I clearly describe those criteria for the

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.160
successful implementation of the project.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.100
And indicators, and the assumptions

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.780
of these indicators, by which we

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.240
will consider the success of the project.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.320
If we talk about the specific management

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.940
of the subject area of a particular

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.000
project, then usually all these parameters

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
are laid down in the so-called

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.400
document program and test

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.840
methodology.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.040
This is shortened to PIM, program and

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.400
test methodology.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.660
And we already at the stage of

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.320
initiation allocate the resource

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.540
in this direction in such a way

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.860
that we can clearly fix in this document,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:30.060
in PIMs, these key characteristics.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.400
What we will have on the output after the

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.020
completion of the project, is precisely

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.940
on the key parameters characterizing

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.500
the outcome of the project, by the

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.000
product or service.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.400
And here it is interesting to note that

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.840
there are different approaches, but

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.320
in any case the positive experience

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.960
of project activities shows that we must

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.360
clearly approach in this stage, in

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.700
the stage of initiation of the management

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.740
of the subject area.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.760
Thus, to get away from multi-

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.980
value, get away from

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.000
ambiguity, go to unambiguity

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.320
and clear fixation of these

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.300
basic parameters.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.480
If we carefully and qualitatively,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.940
professionally work out this component

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.940
stage of initiation, then we

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.120
can avoid significant sources

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.080
of conflict, risks and, naturally,

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.640
thus increase the effectiveness

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.980
of the project.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.260
I will briefly give an example

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.180
of how we work in the initiation

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.980
stage, so that we can really

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.100
clearly describe what we will

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.280
get after the project,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.140
in terms of a clear definition

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.920
of the product or

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.040
service parameters.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.540
For example, if we have a project

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.980
to create an electronic document system

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.180
of turnover, and in this project

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.360
we have a module, let's

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.800
say, a office module.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.460
It is a software product.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.100
This module allows referents,

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.960
secretaries to increase productivity

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.600
and improve the quality

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.620
of work.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.180
Formally, we can clearly

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.380
define that this module must work

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.320
in such a way as to ensure

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.420
in the field, as we say, conditions,

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.920
in real conditions of operation

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.000
of the given product, continuous

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.920
operation with maximum load,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.460
that is, using this module

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.240
office by the maximum

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.320
of users or secretaries

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.980
of referents.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.300
If, let's say, we have

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.440
a maximum number of 20 users

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.260
in the organization, then

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.980
we take and investigate

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.220
what the maximum load of

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.460
this office module will

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.040
be with the maximum number

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.320
of users in real

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.760
conditions.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.220
And we determine which parameters

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.660
require the description of the work

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.080
of this module will characterize us

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.520
standard and non-standard mode,

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.360
successful or unsuccessful mode

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.540
of work.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.140
In the section of project quality

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.980
management, when considering

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.880
the functional area of project quality

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.640
management, we will return to this example

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.480
and there we will consider more

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.520
carefully how to qualitatively

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.860
determine the success of a

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.060
particular site or module, in

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.360
this case the module of the project

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.940
office for the development and

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.480
implementation of the project management

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.520
system.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.640
We are already in the initiation stage

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.960
allocating the resource and thinking in that direction.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.540
This is as regards general

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.100
strategic approaches, determining

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.200
the feasibility of the project and

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.460
determining the conditions for the

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.240
successful execution of the project

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.260
as a whole.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.130
After the initiation stage

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.250
we move to the planning stage of

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.670
the management of the subject area

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.250
and at this stage we develop the

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.950
main documents that describe

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.530
the general design of the project,

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.690
which regulate the content of the

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.190
project, that is, specifically

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.350
a list of works, tasks that we

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.290
must perform.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:19.150
To reach the goal and the

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:24.170
project's successful outcome.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.910
We will look at this

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.190
stage further.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.670
The next stage is the organization

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.510
and control of the subject area.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.550
This stage is very important

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.050
in terms of managing

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.150
the project directly.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.830
And here it is very important that moment,

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.590
and how we will control

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.890
those planned activities that

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.930
we have already launched,

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.710
which are going on.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.970
How we will organize feedback

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.930
and how we will then look

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.170
at how different our

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.690
planned indicators are.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.450
The situation we planned from

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.610
the actual actual situation.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.690
In real business, we usually

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.010
compare the plan and the fact.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.790
These basic approaches are

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.370
used in the stage of organization and

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.990
control of project management.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.250
And how we will organize and

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.550
control what methods, technologies

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.450
and tools we will use.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.210
This is all determined

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.290
in the previous stage.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.150
In the planning stage.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.750
At the outcome of the planning

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.890
stage, we already get clearly

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.130
defined tools, methods, technologies

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.130
that we will use further.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:09.010
The meaning and content of all these

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.870
activities.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.310
Organization of them, it occurs in the

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:18.210
next phase, in the implementation phase

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.410
or organization and control of

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.290
the management of the subject area.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.870
Here, from the point of view of management,

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.290
from the point of view of project

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.650
management, the organization of

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.330
feedback is very important.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.210
That is, the organization of such a

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.590
connection, when we organize the entire

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.310
process on the subject area by

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.190
management processes or management,

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.370
we start the execution of work, tasks,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.570
activities we begin to carry out.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.550
And then we must have information

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:05.170
about how progress is going,

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.650
how this or that work, this or that

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.710
task, this or that event develops.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.750
We need to have the technology,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.550
the tools, to really get

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.770
objective information, to get

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:24.830
it in time, and in some cases

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.270
to be able to get it selectively

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.090
at any time when we need

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.650
it, or when it is needed

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.270
by senior management

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.190
or auditors.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.050
It is not very easy, in

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.870
some cases it is a serious

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.630
problem to organize

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.270
a truly objective

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.190
feedback.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.290
If we consider in general what is

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.810
the project management process, we

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.210
see that first of all we must fix

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.710
the planning parameters of

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.910
a particular event or

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.850
the planning parameters of another

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.110
phenomenon, some planning

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.770
parameters, tasks and work

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.730
in this project.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.390
As a rule, we have key

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.010
parameters are the time of

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.010
work, then the budget that

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.930
we spend on the work, labor

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:40.130
costs, human resources, intellectual

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.670
resources, material

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.490
and technical base and

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.670
other resources that

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.650
we plan to spend on the

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.590
work.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.470
We have planned indicators.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.330
On the other hand, we are beginning

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.530
to perform, we have already gone through

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.410
the process of implementation of this

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.870
work and we are approaching the completion

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.730
of this work and at the point of completion

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.070
of the work we can clearly assess

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.990
what we actually spent on time,

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.950
on the budget, on labor

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.150
costs, on the material

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.650
and technical base, on other

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.510
resources in general.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.730
Compare the planned indicators and

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.210
actual indicators.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.750
Thus, we see that for quality

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.030
project management to efficiently

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.790
manage the project

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.250
we need quality planning

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.730
indicators.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.650
Very qualitative planning and qualitative

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.230
indicators of the actual

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.430
state of affairs in the project

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:52.770
That is, both the first assessment

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.630
and the second assessment, they

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.110
must have the minimum error, they

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.690
must be verified, or in other

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.310
words, they must correspond

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.510
to reality, especially as

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.230
regards the assessment of

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.430
the actual state.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.470
And here we see that a lot depends

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.350
on how we shape the processes

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.830
of interaction, for

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.450
example, in the team, how

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:25.610
much we trust our team members,

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.290
how much we trust the tools and

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.990
technologies, this assessment

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.270
of the actual state

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.670
of affairs in the project.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.290
This is what our main arguments

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.210
go when considering the reasons.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.310
Why do we often find that the actual

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.250
state of affairs in the project

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.730
is different from what we, for

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.810
example, have in the reports?

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:04.710
We see that when considering the area

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.070
of management of the subject part

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.690
we are one way or another connected

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.470
with other areas.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.610
And here we see that

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.810
when we really consider this

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.610
part of the process we must consider

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.350
how it is all related in general

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.390
to the overall process.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.010
And again we return to our common

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.990
systemic approach and see that it

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.550
is impossible to take a separate

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.810
component part in a real

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:41.390
project, cut it out and consider

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.870
it separately.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.430
As a result, we will come to the fact

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.610
that we get parameters of consideration

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:52.570
and analysis that are different from reality.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:52.990
Why is it?

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.050
Because this part that we have articulated,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.970
that we have cut out and consider

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.050
separately, it actually lives,

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:06.030
as we say, and is an integral

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.990
part of the common phenomenon,

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.070
the common event.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:17.290
It is not possible to say that after

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.070
studying the parameters of the frog

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.490
heart, when we take and prepare this

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.710
frog, we cut out the frog heart,

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.950
then look at it on the preparation

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.130
table, fix the parameters of this

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.370
heart and we will argue that these

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.750
parameters fully correspond to reality.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.410
No, we must understand that after the

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:46.410
breakdown process, as we say,

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.050
or the separation, or after the process

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.210
of separating some of the

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.090
parameters of the object,

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.810
the research of the control

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.750
object will change.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.610
The same is used when considering

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:05.030
the area of management of the subject

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:09.370
part of the project.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.350
This cannot be considered separately.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.110
If we are engaged in considering the

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.370
management of the subject area, we

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.170
must remember that it is all interrelated.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.950
If we change something in the

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.130
substance of the project, it is

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.910
clear that this change can affect

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.810
the change in time management,

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.450
that is, time can change.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.830
A resource may change, for example,

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.190
if we change something in the

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.510
object essence of the project,

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.550
it can result in a change in

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.610
the composition of the team or in

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.990
the functions of the team members,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.970
that is, it will affect the

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.050
subject functional area, which we

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.990
call human resource management

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:03.290
or labor resources management.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.730
This will also affect the functional

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.370
area of quality management,

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.710
cost management, risk management,

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:10.970
and so on.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:11.000


00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.100
That is, using such a method,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.380
a differentiated method, a method

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.340
of analysis, we must always

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.140
remember that this method has

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.300
negative aspects and we must

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.900
remember this.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.380
We must remember that everything in

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.380
project management is interrelated and

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.800
when considering a particular area we

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.980
must take these connections into account.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.460
If we return to the stage

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.640
of organization and control of the

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.660
subject area management, then

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.080
here the main method is, as I have

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.900
already said, the method of

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.680
control by compiling reports,

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.100
removing the current key

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.320
parameters characterizing

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.060
one or another work, task,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.240
one or another product

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.640
or subproduct, service.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.520
And all this is organized through

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.220
the creation of feedback.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.180
In project management, feedback

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.040
is divided into negative and

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.800
negative.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.540
Negative feedback leads

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.120
to stabilization of

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.120
the situation.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.640
That is, if we have a planned indicator

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.880
and this indicator in the process

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.760
of implementing the project is a

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.820
certain analytical development,

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.120
can be described by an analytical

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.880
function, then the actual

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.340
state may not coincide with

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.460
our planned indicators and

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.180
we should at any time be able

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.560
to determine the difference

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.260
between the plan and the fact.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.020
If we have a difference, the difference

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.960
between plan and fact increases, then the

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.360
organization of feedback and

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.320
negative connection leads to the fact

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.760
that the function of this difference

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.580
argument must be reduced.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.600
That is, if the difference argument

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.920
increases, we must organize

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.420
such feedback to affect the

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.720
subprocess in the direction

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.080
of the minimum deviation

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.580
from the plan.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.200
That is, bring this parameter to

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.360
the same planned indicators.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.260
This is the essence of the organization

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.600
of feedback and negative communication.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.860
Positive feedback is used when, when

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.940
the difference or difference

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.280
between plan and fact increases,

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:10.880
we bring the system to a state

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.320
where the plan and fact increases

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.540
even more at the next moment.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.160
That is, with the increase of the argument,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.620
the function increases even more.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.520
This is called positive

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.240
feedback.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.320
Positive feedback, as a rule,

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.940
leads to sharp changes,

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.320
can lead to revolutionary

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.720
changes, to leaps.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.100
And use this connection must be

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.440
very and very careful.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.620
As the saying goes, think seven times,

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.940
measure seven times before

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.880
using this connection.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.580
Positive feedback can, if insufficient

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.260
analysis of the consequences

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.140
of its application, lead to significant

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.480
negative consequences, and

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.200
sometimes to the complete collapse

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.820
of the project.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.300
That is, you can't use this

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.520
tool as a toy, to battle,

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.660
as we say, with it.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.020
We need to analyze very carefully

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.020
what will happen if we apply

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.000
this technology.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.460
As for negative feedback, it

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.800
is very effective and is essentially

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.600
used consciously or unconsciously

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.780
in many successful relationships

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.160
to bring the project into

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.830
the area of successful

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.490
implementation.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.550
According to the key parameters, we must

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.450
dynamically draw out these indicators in such

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.850
a way that they are in the area of successful

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.590
implementation of the project.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.650
This is all done through

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.510
reporting.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.650
Reporting in project management can

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.790
be of different types.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.410
There are usually two main types of reporting.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.290
This is dynamic reporting and

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.350
retrospective reporting.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:27.290
Dynamic reporting, it is organized

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.610
in such a way that we must receive

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:34.210
information dynamically during

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.930
the execution of the project or,

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.090
as we say, during the life cycle

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.590
of the project with a certain window,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.590
with the importance, for example,

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.930
daily or weekly or once

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.830
a month we must receive reports

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:54.430
on the state of affairs on

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.110
a particular job, a particular

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.730
task.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.890
Retrospective reporting, it implies the

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:07.210
fact that the requirement of a

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.210
higher management or project

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.850
implementation conditions, when we need

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.970
to make an overview of the entire state

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.390
of the project from its point of initiation

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:26.430
to the current complete report throughout

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.210
the time of implementation

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.390
of the project to the present day.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.970
We must be prepared and have the

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.630
technology, the tools that

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.830
will allow to give the management

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:46.910
or the auditor a complete report.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.650
This reporting system is usually

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.370
called retrospective reporting.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.250


00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.450
In terms of tracking the dynamics

00:36:56.450 --> 00:37:02.030
of project performance or, as

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.010
we usually say, in terms of

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.630
progress, project development.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.550
This term is taken from English

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.810
literature, but it is already

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.590
used in our business, in our environment.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.530


00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.470
We usually use a dynamic type

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.950
of reporting.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.630
Reporting is usually used to

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:34.370
focus on the main duration of the

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.290
typical projects or the main mass

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.390
of projects that are implemented

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.550
in the portfolio of the

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:41.690
enterprise.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.610
We have already considered

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:47.190
this issue in part and now we will

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.670
look at how to organize

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.130
and implement dynamic weekly

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.110
reporting for an example.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.360
Here you need to take into

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.760
account the features of doing business,

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.060
and the features of the project implementation

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.920
conditions, the features of

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.040
the team, up to the features of

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.800
individual individuals, team

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.000
members who participate in the

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.640
project.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.000
The practice of reporting in the

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.040
Russian business shows that the

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.140
most popular weekly reporting

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:31.140
with the reporting point on Monday.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.140
Typically, the management

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.280
of the enterprise, the

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.640
CEO usually holds

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.840
on Monday weekly so-called

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.460
planners, where heads

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.740
of divisions or heads

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.120
of complex priority projects

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.060
report.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.000
In this situation, the quality

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.240
of reporting and project management

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.680
cannot be ensured at the maximum.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.480
Especially as far as our

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.500
Russian reality is concerned,

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.000
it really happens that usually,

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:18.000
he doesn't remember exactly

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.400
what happened next week.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:21.840
Why is it?

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.800
Because, let's say, if the

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.320
problem in the project arose on

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.260
a Tuesday or Monday of the

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.580
previous week, and the working

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.980
week ends on a Friday, then there

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.040
were still weekends, Saturday, Sunday.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.620
Considering our characteristics,

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.600
the characteristics of the Russian character,

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.360
we know that the period

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.620
of Saturday-Sunday is usually such that

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.320
we relax and do not very clearly

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.200
and unambiguously remember the details

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.860
that preceded this period.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.260
If the reporting is built

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.400
on this principle of weekly

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.060
schedules, that is, the main

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.060
emphasis is on oral reporting,

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.640
on the meeting, and so on,

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.340
then the situation is quite,

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.440
as we say, prone to chaos.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:29.460
And not clear, but the organization of

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.160
the information that corresponds to the

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.180
actual state of affairs in the project.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.820
Let us take a typical situation for example.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.580
10h00 to

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.980
The Director-General is planning

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.760
to conduct a report or, as

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.460
we say, a planner by this time.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.080
Usually even such an event is

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.720
formally called “five minutes.”

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.220
Within 5 minutes 10 all executives, including

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.480
the executives of important projects,

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.460
are in the general director's reception

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.060
room, and the secretary

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.420
10.00 asks everyone to go to

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.260
the general director.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.760
The reporting process begins.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.480
This procedure usually takes not 5

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.600
minutes, but more.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.200
Sometimes it happens that another member

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.620
of the team calls at 11 a.m. and where is the manager?

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.160
He is 5 minutes from the director.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.120
At 12 a.m. where is he?

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.300
He is 5 minutes from the director.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.100
We understand that this situation

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.660
leads to growing distrust of the leadership.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.480
To the fact that all members of the

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.120
team and the team inside accumulate

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.120
some kind of distrust in general to

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.480
this business process.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.480
And it is clear that if we talk about

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.900
a design professional approach,

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.220
then we should call things

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.020
by their names.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.600
This is first, and secondly, we should

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.240
not engage in self-deception

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.840
and deceive others.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.340
That is, if we are talking about

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.820
5 minutes, it means 10-0-0, 10-0-5.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.500
It is 5 minutes.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.340
All the rest is different.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.160
If we talk about a meeting, it

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.120
is usually 20 minutes.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.920
If the event lasts 3 hours, it

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.040
is no longer a meeting, it is

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.380
a seminar.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.200
Things must be called by their names.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.360
The meeting is prepared in such a way

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.400
that the agenda is forwarded

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.900
in advance.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.140
All participants of this event

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.020
are notified in advance

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.160
who will speak, what problem

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.460
we will discuss, what needs

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.040
to be solved.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.880
And all participants of this event, going

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.040
to the meeting, already know what it is about

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.500
and actually have already prepared their

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.380
opinion.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.520
The event itself is reduced only to the fact

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.880
that after consulting to agree

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.160
on the opinion of each participant,

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.260
take into account his comment.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.140
In efficiently operating

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.060
enterprises, where the process of business

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.200
is effectively delivered,

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.300
the meeting takes place

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.740
very quickly.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.520
And in fact the organizer of this meeting,

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.360
the coordinator or administrator,

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.500
he, going to the meeting,

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.380
already has a draft protocol

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.360
and a draft decision.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.940
This proposal is only being adjusted at the meeting.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.020
Of course, the total

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.240
labor costs can be small.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.040
20 minutes is the maximum.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.700
If we calculate the actual

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:00.260
labor costs of such events, which

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.180
we call meetings, and they

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.780
can last 3 hours, then we can

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.860
have 30 people or 50

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:09.680
people present at the meeting.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.760
And that is usually all top managers.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.540
Having calculated the cost of each

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.460
resource, each of these top

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.260
managers, we come to the conclusion

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.200
that such activities are monstrously

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.620
costly.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.380
This leads to the fact that our project

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.660
is also decreasing in efficiency.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.080
We must consider what

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.180
technologies we use when

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.160
organizing negative feedback,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.380
when organizing

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.560
dynamic reference.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.960
Let us return to our example.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.360
All project managers, heads

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.800
of functional units

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.820
are invited to the CEO,

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.900
and the CEO begins to

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.560
consider the problems that

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.120
have formed over the past

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.700
period, that is, over

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.740
the previous week.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.220
At the same time, a specific question

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.160
is asked, let's say, to me, as

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.400
the project manager, and what happened

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.000
there at the end of Monday in the

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.320
reporting period?

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.000
I start to think quickly, remember

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.340
what happened there.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.240
And I initially had a hard setup

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.940
given to the fact that I have

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.420
a limited time resource, that is,

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.860
I have to quickly remember all

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.700
the details, analyze and so on.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.920
I have not yet fully remembered what

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.680
it was about.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.600
And here comes the next question.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.920
What specifically do you propose

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.100
to solve this problem?

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.780
Again, I am under the press of

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.580
lack of time, under very strict

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.500
restriction, I must make a proposal,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.960
and constructive such, to

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.900
take the situation out of the

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.620
crisis, solve the problem and

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.480
continue to go within the framework

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.340
of the planned parameters.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.080
Naturally, with such a

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.940
tiny resource, time, I can

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.280
give a not quite balanced proposal.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.180
And, as a rule, we observe such

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.300
a situation that after the

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.740
meeting with the general director, many

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.940
managers, coming out, think,

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.680
behold, I was dragged in the tongue,

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.300
this is what to say.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.260
How to break this crap now?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.900
Very difficult.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.860
Who is to blame in such a situation?

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.860
Who has constructed such a dynamic

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.040
reporting system that is laid as

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.720
the basis of management, the basis

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.960
of project management?

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.800
We understand that in this situation,

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.800
above all, the top

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.560
managers, the CEO are to blame.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.340
Why is it?

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.480
Because it was how he organized

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.040
the reporting system.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.460
He put his immediate colleagues,

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.960
executives, project

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.260
managers, managers in a situation

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.920
where they are unable

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.660
to propose constructive, reasonable

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.800
measures that would effectively

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.200
solve the current problems

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.960
and effectively move

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.960
towards completion

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.800
of projects and achieving

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.600
their results.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.280
If we consider the experience of

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.940
more successful business options,

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.720
the experience of those organizations

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.820
where an efficiently operating project

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.460
management system has been developed

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.760
and implemented, we will see several

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.640
other options for implementing

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.640
dynamic reporting.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.500
Usually, when organizing

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.240
weekly reports, we analyze

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.520
the overall situation, we use

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.780
our resources, we use our

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.540
knowledge, technology,

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.500
methods and take on the weapon

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.900
of what will be most effective.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.020
For example, knowledge of personality

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.680
psychology leads to the fact that

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.140
it is most optimal to build dynamic

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.740
reporting in such a way that

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.840
reports are provided

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.100
at the end of the current week.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:47.900
At 17:00 every week on Friday.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.860
It is interesting to note that

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.640
we use developed forms

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.020
and report templates in

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.180
a really effective project

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.840
management system.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.560
In this situation, the templates

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.800
are not the list of tasks and work

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.160
performed in the first place, but

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.620
the list of problems that have

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.320
arisen for the reporting period,

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.520
for the week.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.060
And it is understandable why, because

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.880
we have processes or

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.680
sub-processes, as we say, planning.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.920
We have documents at the initiation

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.800
and planning stage that clearly

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.340
define what we should do,

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.620
when we should do, how we

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:39.200
should do and what will be

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.720
on the way out.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.880
If we talk about the volume of work, the

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.880
composition of work, the tasks that we

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.320
solve for the reporting period, specifically

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.820
for the week, then this list

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.400
we already have.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.500
If we force our performers,

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.320
employees, to list the

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.360
composition of the work, we

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.220
thus assume that our employees

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.440
have elements of schizophrenia

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.380
or amnesia.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.160
We treat them disrespectfully.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.320
We think they have 7 Friday a week

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.600
and they don't remember what they planned

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.120
yesterday or what they're going

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.080
to do today.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.640
That is, we understand that here

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.400
the quality of management leaves

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.540
much to be desired.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.140
In successful project management

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.740
systems, in successful organizations,

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:38.800
of course, in the dynamic reporting

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.580
template, weekly reporting, the

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.820
list of problems that arose during

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.680
the reporting period is

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.960
at the first place.

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:54.200
On the composition of the report

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.960
template we will return

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.000
when we consider the functional

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.680
area we call value

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.360
analysis or value management.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.040
Now we will continue to consider

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.560
the organization of dynamic

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.800
reporting, which is usually

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.560
used in successful enterprises.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:18.600
So, we are moving the report point

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.180
from Monday to Friday.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.720
Suppose we have a working day up to 18

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.140
hours, we plan to provide reports

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:33.640
at 17 o'clock of that pool of our

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.900
resources or, more simply, those responsible

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:38.980
executives who, according to our

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.280
scheme, the documents of turnover

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.620
must provide reports to either

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.280
the administrator or the

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.080
project manager.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.800
And these details are also prescribed in

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.600
the regulations on project management,

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.700
for example, in the position on project

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.820
management of the enterprise.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:03.440
And these regulations are also fixed

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.260
in the configuration of the

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.140
tooling tools that we

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.860
use when managing projects,

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.720
for example, in Primavera or

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.380
in Microsoft Project or

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.980
in other tools.

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:19.760
And most of the information, most

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.020
of the content of the

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.540
reporting is generated

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.420
automatically by technologies and tools.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.540
If the problems that arise

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.020
are low priority or, as we

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.220
say, routine, then here is

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:39.000
mainly the processing of these

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.020
problems with tools and only

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.420
a squeeze is given up, as we say.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.040
That is, with minor deviations,

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.060
let's say, we see that over the

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.780
past period there have been

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.460
deviations on some tasks,

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.700
let's say, labor costs are

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.880
spent on two people an hour.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.240
In our position, in project management,

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.280
this is not yet a critical situation, but

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.740
it is already an indicator of the

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.180
emergence of the problem.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.800
And the system, the tool that

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.320
is used in our project management,

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.660
analysing this deviation itself,

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.960
will already signal

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.600
to the higher management,

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.860
say, the administrator,

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.060
that in such a job, for such

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:29.100
a period, there were deviations.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.340
The administrator, having received

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.540
such an email, can react on his

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.360
own, but usually the system is

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.040
configured so that this

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.240
state, first of all, was indicated

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.540
by the responsible executor

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.560
for this work.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.060
And the system sends a request

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.360
to the responsible contractor

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.580
or informs him of deviations.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.620
At the same time, the copy is already

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.060
placed in the direct head of

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.960
this responsible executor in order

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.000
to indicate the sources

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.180
of the problems.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.220
If the problem is more complex,

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.080
the system can be configured in such

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.120
a way that the system informs the

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.880
already responsible for the task

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.080
block or the head of a specific

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.780
executor, a specific

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.580
responsible executor for

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.240
this work.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.960
The responsible person is given

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.560
a copy.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.540
If the problem is even more complex,

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:35.480
the system will notify the

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.960
project administrator.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.040
If it is even more complicated, then

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.720
the situation may already come

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.200
before informing the project manager.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.480
Thus, we see that in principle,

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.040
a significant part of the work on

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.900
tracking the actual state

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.660
of affairs in the project we can

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.500
give to technology and tools.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:03.280
And indeed, this is about 90% of all routine

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.260
work on control of the management of

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.740
the subject area, on control of the implementation

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.260
of the project.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:18.680
And only important, significant

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.640
problems that arise during the

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.660
reporting period, they already require

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.160
direct intervention of certain managers.

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.800
And these problems are already

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.920
recorded in direct letters, reports,

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.600
which are posted at 17:00 on

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.120
Friday, say, to the project

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.380
administrator.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.900
As a project manager, I will remind

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.140
you that we are primarily

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.880
considering complex, large-

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.520
scale projects.

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.720
The project manager does

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.420
not engage in routine reporting

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.120
control work, he is engaged

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.140
only in cases when

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.340
we really have very serious

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.580
problems.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.580
The current control is carried out by

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.380
the project administrator.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:14.560
At 17.00 he collects all reports,

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.320
once again performs an additional

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.160
ranking of problems, once again

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.440
considers how, by what methodology,

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.400
by what scheme he will respond to

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.200
the problems that have arisen.

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.480
And, as a rule, according to the

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.080
level of these problems or

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.960
priority, we can so say, the importance

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.300
of problems it comes.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:45.260
It sends, for example, at 17.30 or at

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.180
18 o'clock, usually at 17.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.800
30, sends appropriate instructions or

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.640
letters to the responsible

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.480
performers for the work where

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.720
problems arose.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:03.400
To, say, 10.00 on Monday,

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.280
these responsible executives

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.860
proposed constructive

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.900
troubleshooting measures

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.700
to bring the project to

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.400
scheduled levels next

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.700
week or within two weeks.

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:27.080
This is the essence of the organization

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.160
of negative feedback in

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.600
successful enterprises.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.240
In this dynamic reporting system,

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.200
it is very interesting to

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.080
consider the other side, namely

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.400
the psychological aspect of

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.960
organizing dynamic reporting.

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:51.460
Psychologists say that if a person

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.380
is loaded overnight with

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.420
some problem, he will work over

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.420
the problem at the subconscious,

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.120
unconscious level at night

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.240
in a dream.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.780
And the dynamic reporting organizer

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.800
we have now considered has taken

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.300
into account these fundamental

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.020
psychological features

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.340
of a person.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.900
And it gives the opportunity

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:24.120
to the responsible executor

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.060
who has problems during the

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.620
reporting period to get the

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:34.860
maximum time resource to the next

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.700
control point, where he must issue

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.980
a proposal for the measures

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.100
to eliminate the decisive problem

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:48.160
on Monday, 10.00.

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.840
The organizer of this whole process

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.880
provides very large resources.

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.820
That is, a person actually works

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.980
on the night of Friday to Saturday.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.200
His brain, or he in general, can

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.320
consciously work on this problem

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.840
on Saturday, Saturday night

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.460
on Sunday, Sunday night and Sunday

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.280
night on Monday.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.980
In fact, the resources that are

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.020
allocated for this is enormous.

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.240
But an ordinary person on the

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.560
outside can ask the question,

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.900
how do you disrespect the person

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.520
and where your concepts, weekends,

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.880
vacations and so on, and

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.520
you actually make a person

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:39.020
work overtime, over-normal.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.980
But this can be given a normal

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.800
answer, and that is.

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:49.500
If you are a professional and took on

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.380
some work, and if you initially

00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:55.100
agreed on a plan schedule, and in many

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.260
cases you gave yourself a proposal

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.160
on the composition of the work, on

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.900
the volume, on the time of execution,

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.980
and you did not perform it, and

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.860
there you have some problems,

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.880
then please try to eliminate them.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:18.660
That is, we are appropriate to organize

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.700
the work in the team and this is the aspect

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.420
we use.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.680
We treat people professionally

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.140
and hope that now this person

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.420
will remove the problem, and

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.680
in the future he will no longer

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.420
allow such a situation when

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.100
during the working week he has

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.920
allowed the problem, or even

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.380
generated it, then we organize

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.200
the dynamic reporting process

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.620
so that people work productively

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.560
and efficiently in fixed

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.960
working hours, during the

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.980
working week, and that they

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.640
really rest on weekends.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.840


01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.840
But in general it is understandable

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.320
that even aspects such as the organization

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.200
of weekly reporting, we must analyze

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.660
very carefully, taking into account

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.440
as much as possible all the factors

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.860
that affect this process.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.380
And this process we must

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.420
build in such a way that, embedded

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.440
in the overall project management

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.380
process, it gives maximum

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.140
efficiency.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:37.340
If we go further to the stage of

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.680
organization control of the management

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.240
of the subject area of the project, then

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.620
in those organizations where we see

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.860
high efficiency of project activities,

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.100
they are usually approached systematically.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.320
And there this stage is organized

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.200
using the most modern technologies

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.880
on the one hand, on the other hand,

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.560
simple and relatively simple,

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.140
understandable technologies for

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:13.060
performers or responsible performers.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.560
One of the most common technologies,

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.280
effective technologies,

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.360
is the technology, as we have already

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.200
considered it in part, structural

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.760
decomposition of works or work

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.740
breakdown structure, VBS.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.680
The core of the management of

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.400
the subject area in modern business

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.360
conditions, in those

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.160
enterprises where it is implemented

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.460
successfully, is this VBS

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.560
tool, structural decomposition

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.580
of work.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:55.120
We have already said where, at what

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.220
stage and in what form VBS

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.020
can appear.

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:05.860
If we approach the project in general and approach

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.660
it with an understanding that we are working

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.480
in the project by iteration, then we understand

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.700
that we are in the stage of initiation

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:21.160
or in the initial phase of the life

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.280
cycle of the project, we can make

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.020
a work breakdown structure,

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.160
a structural decomposition

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.940
of the work, block.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:34.900
And with little accuracy, without a detailed

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.520
description of individual small

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.760
components of the work, namely,

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.760
block.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.680
When we move into the final

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.620
part of the planning phase,

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.240
we must very carefully and carefully

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.540
with the accuracy that we have

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.100
planned, to write the composition

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.100
of the work, to decompose them

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.180
to the level to realize the overall

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.720
given accuracy of the implementation

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.460
of projects on critical

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.960
parameters.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:17.260
At this stage, the work breakdown structure,

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.400
the structural decomposition

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.220
of the work is already

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.580
prescribed in detail.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.080
The depth of the structure

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.340
of the work, the level of

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.620
detail depends on many factors.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.180
For example, if the enterprise

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.300
is at a certain initial level

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.280
of maturity and the first steps

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.400
are only taken in the development

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.600
and implementation of a project management

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.360
system, then, as a rule, in

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.040
such a situation, the depth

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.280
of detailing the work breakdown

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.620
structure, structural decomposition

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.160
of the work is very

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.700
deep.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.640
We detail the work to individual

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.860
small components.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.120
Furthermore, if this system is

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.000
already starting to work, it

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.880
starts to function at its full

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.740
capacity, if we have human resources,

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:23.040
the team has mastered all this, and

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.740
if we already have the process going,

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.780
as we say, in a set-up way, then

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.740
we can remove part of the detail

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.440
and move to a not-so-level detail.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.340
The detail of the structural

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.620
decomposition of the work depends on

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:51.980
the general corporate culture in the organization.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.420
That is, if we have a high level of trust

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.040
between the members of the team, between

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.180
the members of the project

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:06.760
team, then we are forced to give

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.940
the structural decomposition

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:13.180
of the works with very large detail.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.720
If we have a high level of trust,

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:23.060
then we can not give detail to individual

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:26.260
small works, but limit ourselves

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.300
to only blocks of work and

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.320
blocks of tasks.

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.560
In other words, if I know that this

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.520
job was taken by a professional,

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.220
responsible person, and I already have

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:48.540
experience working with him, he always

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.520
performed the work qualitatively,

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.720
on time and, as we say,

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.040
never put me in the way.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.640
And if he is assigned a certain

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.160
job in this project, and he said

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.920
according to the plan that he

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.320
would finish the work on August

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.240
24, then I, in principle, can

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.540
not even control that person.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.680
And I can not go down to a more

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.200
detailed level, but simply write

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.760
that this is a job, this

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.960
is a result on the output

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.120
with such parameters will

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.600
be August 24, and here the team

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.200
that performs this work

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.540
is, and the responsible

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.180
executor is.

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.440
Thus, we see that the level of detailed

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.220
structural decomposition of the work

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.900
is primarily influenced by those

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.600
parameters that we formulate in the

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.740
requirements for quality management

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:53.260
of projects, the accuracy of determining

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.120
parameters, the level and accuracy

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.400
of admissible risks.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:08.140
That is, it is important for us in

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.760
general, where is the limit we can

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.860
not control, and thus we determine

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.100
the level of detailed structural

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.120
decomposition of the works.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.780
The following slide is an example

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.120
of structural decomposition of works.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:33.060
This is a table-based form of the structural

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.740
decomposition of works, and this table

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.780
may consist of the following content.

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:44.020
In the first column, we can mark the

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.680
number of work in order, then the

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.760
name of the work, the task, then

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.080
the number of the previous work or task.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.280
The next column is the length of work.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.160
The duration can be measured in

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.640
days, hours.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.100
Next, it can be the start date, the end date.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.640
The next column is very important

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.980
work costs.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.520
We can calculate labor costs in

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.200
human days, human years for large

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.920
labor-intensive work, or in

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.740
human hours.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.520
The next column is the cost

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.020
or cost of performing

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:39.340
the task, task or event.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.000
The next column is the workforce

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.200
or human resources.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.900
The next column is the priority of task

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.660
or work.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.620
There may be other columns.

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.840
In general, structural decomposition

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.260
of works can be equipped

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.120
in such a way as to best

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.480
provide the service

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.660
level of the manager or

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.260
consumer of this tool of

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.420
structural decomposition

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.760
of works.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.260
As more convenient for the user

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:20.180
of this tool, we provide

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.580
a general organization or general

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.620
view of this document.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.060
In general, one of the basic

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.500
axioms of management is as follows.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:37.080
We must provide documents in the

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.380
process of the project management

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.480
document, so that in form

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.020
and content it satisfies

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.820
or adequately suits

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:52.180
the consumer of this

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.540
document.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.360
In order to prepare a document,

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.640
we must first of

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:02.680
all focus on who is the user

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.660
of the document.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.440
But if we return to this example,

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:15.340
here we should consider some important

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:19.140
aspects in more detail.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.940
Here is the third column, the

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.200
number of the previous task or task.

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:30.240
If we plan work in the project

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.540
consistently, that is, one work

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.020
is completed, the second

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.260
begins, and so on, then the third

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.540
column is nothing more than the

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.220
first column moved with a shift

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.980
to one position down.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:51.260
That is, the second work as

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:53.100
the previous work is the

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.360
first, the third work

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.240
is the second, the fourth

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.560
- the third and so on.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:05.380
Let us consider the general definition of the project.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:08.200
The project is carried out within

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.040
the limits of resources and above

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:10.820
all time.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:15.900
And in almost any project,

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.400
we can't use only consistent

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.520
planning of work.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.300
Parallel planning

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.480
is required.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.380
And the more work we have performed

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:34.580
in parallel, the more labor

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.900
and resources we need

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.180
to attract for management,

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.960
for project management.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.420
The higher the professionalism

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.140
of the manager, the

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.140
more limited conditions he can work.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.260
That is, the higher the professional

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.460
manages the project, the more he

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.260
has in the project of parallel work.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.580
This fact is reflected in the structural decomposition

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:05.500
of the works in the third column.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.100
That is, parallel works in the third

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.180
column are seen in such a way

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:14.040
that we see when the same number

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.780
of the predecessor is repeated

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.680
several times.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.900
Duration of work.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.720
On estimates of the duration of

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.600
work, we will still stop when

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.480
we consider the functional

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.320
area of managing project timing

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.400
parameters.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.640
But I would like to say that here

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.340
is often used another column

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.860
that accompanies the length

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:49.220
column, namely the time reserve

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.200
column or time reserve

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.340
column.

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.880
We have already considered some

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.800
aspects of time reservation when

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.740
studying the manager's

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.460
personal limited resources.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.360
The time reserve in structural

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.940
decomposition of works is very

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.300
often used when we deal with

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:21.520
innovative projects, new projects.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.340
In those projects where the

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:26.160
element of novelty is very large,

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.420
and we have significant risks

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.300
to perform new types of work, and so on.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.060
Then we should pay special

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:38.060
attention to reserve resources

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:41.100
in order to really

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.040
the project results, to

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.480
the project objectives

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.940
successfully.

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.100
The labor costs.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.700
Labor costs are usually determined

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.860
by functional requirements

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.200
for a given job, event

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.060
or requirement for a product

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.900
or product or service

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.640
created.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.700
The cost of work is determined

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.080
by the conditions in which the work

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.540
or task is implemented.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.960
Labor costs also depend on the

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.380
productivity of labor, or the quality

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.620
of the labor resource, the quality

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.060
of the process, the quality

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.000
of the tools, the quality of

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.180
the service used in the

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.060
given work or task.

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:46.360
It is clear that if we

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.700
are to do the work using

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.280
a high-level professional

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.300
with high productivity, then

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.080
we can see the same work as

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.840
a high-level professional can

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.860
do, say, in two days, and a

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:08.000
professional with lower productivity

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.980
can do this work in not

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.960
two days, but in three

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.100
days, and sometimes in

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.400
five days.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.560
Thus, we see that if this work is

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.720
done by one person, then in the first

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.400
case we get the labor

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.280
costs of two people a day,

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.320
and in the second case five

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.920
people a day.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.300
Direct dependence on

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.160
labor productivity.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:41.920
If we consider the project as a whole,

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.280
and we said that management, project

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.380
management is applied precisely to

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.680
increase dividends, increase profitability,

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.820
increase the project royals, then

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.080
it is clear that we should strive

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:01.820
to create such conditions in

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.500
which the productivity

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.240
of labor, the productivity

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.300
of the process are very and

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.800
very high.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.360
This is all directly related to the

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.500
labor cost column.

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:25.720
In general, we must understand that

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:30.100
here when calculating this column,

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:34.080
different factors can affect differently.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.140
As a rule, in the typical conditions

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:41.240
of modern Russia, when we perform

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.940
projects in a normal situation,

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.420
ordinary executives try

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.420
to lower the productivity

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.340
of labor, or, as we say,

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.500
to subdue a slump.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.680
That is, if, say, a high-

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.800
performance resource can

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.400
do the job within two days,

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.980
then an ordinary employee

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.460
can say that he will do the

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.480
job for five days.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.200
This situation is typical.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.520
How in this case, however, to lead

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.940
to the fact that the person does not

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:30.260
dynamize us, that the person does

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.760
not engage not only in self-deception,

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.520
but also deception, and that we

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.940
lead the labor resource to a state

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.520
of more active, to a state

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.060
of truly professional work in

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.360
such a way that we do not have the

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360
project delayed in time,

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.840
that we do not have the project delayed

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.400
in resources.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.400
Often for these purposes is used

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.540
the so-called work day photography

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.720
technology.

01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:10.480
However, this technology is not always effective.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.780
Moreover, in many cases of design

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.560
activity this technology,

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.720
the application of this

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.340
technology can lead to

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.880
negative consequences.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.780
I will briefly remind you of the essence of this technology.

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:29.720
If we have a labor resource,

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:32.860
specifically a person, claiming that

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:37.640
he can do this type of work

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.800
in one day or two days, and we

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.080
on the side assume that he does not

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.120
spend some time on these immediate

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.400
matters during the performance

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.540
of this work, but as we say spends

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.440
left, inefficiently, then then

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.920
an event is organized when the

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.260
whole working day, let us say

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.440
8 hours, with this person is a controller

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.660
or auditor, a chronometer with

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:13.780
a secondometer, and he

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:18.440
consistently records all the actions

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.140
that this employee performs

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.240
and chronometers them, up to the

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.640
point that he records when

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.220
the person came, when he sat

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.480
off the workplace, when the person

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.220
went to a break, when the person

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.000
went to the toilet and

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.640
returned.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.760
In general, for almost any

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.400
person such a procedure is somewhat

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.660
degrading, that is, the very fact

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:54.980
that you will be controlled

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:58.360
and checked today, what

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:01.380
you do at work, how you do at

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.220
work, he is already a bit alarmering,

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:07.440
and it is understandable that

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.360
such a person inside has

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:16.920
some mood of distancing or

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.680
rejection, at least

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.980
this leads to negative consequences

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.120
in the relationship

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.800
within the team, in

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.180
the relationship between

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:32.320
the employee and the

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.160
manager.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.280
On the other hand, if you look at what

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.360
the results of this technology

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.300
are, what the results of using

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.340
this tool, the timing of the

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.980
working day or the photograph

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:49.500
of the working day, then we

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.980
see that, as a rule, the result

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:55.940
is most often far from reality.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.220
Why is it?

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.080
Because if the person who

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.220
will be controlled today

01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:06.500
understands what it is about,

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.420
he can arrange a loading today,

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:13.140
during the whole day of chronometry

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.620
or audit in such a way that

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:20.660
he will be busy very intensely,

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.520
that he will do a giant volume

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.860
of work during that day,

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:28.720
that he will spin like

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.320
a protein in a wheel, he

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.820
can show a really monstrous

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.080
load, and so on.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:40.040
And we understand that as a result

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.120
of this picture of the day we will

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.660
get data that, to say gently, does

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.240
not correspond to reality.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.940
This is most often the case.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.020
That is, on the one hand, we see

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.280
that in reality, especially in the

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.220
design activity, the result of the

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.040
use of the photo tool of the day

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.200
is heavily distorted.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.700
On the other hand, we see

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.780
that after such events, relations

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.020
within the team become

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.380
more tense, more difficult.

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.660


01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.800
This, in principle, contradicts

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:25.320
the design approach of one of

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.820
the fundamental axioms of project

01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:30.700
management, which states that we,

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:34.760
creating a team, the project team

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.780
should strive to create such conditions

01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:40.920
that the energy, labor costs

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:43.320
on internal interactions

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.720
between the team members

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.200
were minimal.

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.480
In this case, we see that this is

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.540
contrary to the axioms of management.

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.320
It is easier to record

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.640
the productivity of work and

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.080
adjust it toward increasing,

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:11.720
for example, by personal example.

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:18.640
Let's say we are considering

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.640
a project to implement a

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:23.000
new project management tool of

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
the same Microsoft Project.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.600
And this tool is set up in a group

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.560
of managers, say, there are 10

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.500
people.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.300
We initially conducted analysis, evaluation

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.700
of the calculation, compared them with the

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.600
experience of neighboring organizations,

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.540
enterprises, where this tool already

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.920
works successfully.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.880
And according to our planned

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.000
indicators, the productivity

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.900
of this type of resources

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.920
of our managers should

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.380
increase, say, twice.

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.920
Suppose we are considering a specific

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.100
task of drawing up a package of

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.060
documents for the opening of a

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:12.580
medium-scale project in the field

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:13.720
of IT.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.660
We have managers in this area,

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:19.260
they are professionals.

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:23.800
Before this, as a result

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.820
of a pre-project survey, we

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.700
recorded that managers

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.800
used certain technologies,

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.240
tools, for example,

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.120
Word, Excel.

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.760
After that, they will already

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.720
use the Microsoft Project

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:41.900
tool and part of the project management

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.400
system.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:46.560
We will talk about it a little later.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.240
Before the implementation

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.100
of the project, the productivity was

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:57.580
such that for a typical project

01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.140
of such a direction, in such

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:02.560
conditions, for such a level of

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.480
professional our employees

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:07.080
they spend, say, two people a day

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.080
on preparing a full package of

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.780
documents for the opening

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:13.580
of the project.

01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:18.430
Under the package of documents we can mean,

01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:21.470
say, the charter of the project, the calendar

01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:24.010
and network schedule, the resource

01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:27.430
plan, the budget, the schedule of implementation

01:26:27.930 --> 01:26:30.770
of the budget or the execution

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:32.630
of the budget.

01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:35.690
Other documents will be discussed a little

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:36.770
later.

01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:38.710
The entire package of documents,

01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:40.870
which is usually attached

01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:43.230
to the project opening

01:26:43.410 --> 01:26:45.250
order, which is signed by

01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:46.890
the CEO or the relevant

01:26:46.890 --> 01:26:48.330
official.

01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:54.310
After the implementation of the tool,

01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:57.310
we hoped that the labor costs would be

01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:58.550
one person alone.

01:26:59.530 --> 01:27:04.230
But after the completion of this project,

01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:07.650
we implemented the tool, it started

01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:11.650
working, we come to our colleagues,

01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:14.610
to the managers in this group.

01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:18.290
They say that it doesn't work

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:18.930
one day.

01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:20.890
Moreover, it became worse.

01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:24.190
We started out all these documents

01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:26.550
and so on to be made in 4 days.

01:27:26.710 --> 01:27:27.050
Why is it?

01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:28.950
Because the number of documents increased,

01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:33.030
the detail increased, the

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:37.090
requirements for accuracy of calculations

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:39.950
increased and, accordingly,

01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:42.410
labor costs increased.

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:46.470
Four people a day, here's what it

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.830
takes to make up a package

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.970
of documents for the project's

01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:51.950
opening.

01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:53.970
There were two days before this project.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.420
In this situation, you can do

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.600
the following.

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:06.520
If I have experience in using

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.800
this tool, I can conduct the

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.940
event myself and organize

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:13.940
this event in such a way that

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:16.200
I can show my colleagues, managers,

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.300
how much time I really

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.720
need to prepare this package

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.020
of documents for

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.360
the project opening.
