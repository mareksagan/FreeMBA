00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello, dear listeners. My name is Tatyana Zhubreva.

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
I am a lecturer, a candidate for the Technical Sciences of the Russian Economic Academy of Plekhanov.

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
Today, you will be offered a video course on the adoption of rational and creative decisions in business.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
During the video lecture, we will discuss the following aspects and points.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
First of all, we will discuss the adoption of rational decisions based on scientific research,

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
which we discussed in the previous course.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
We will look at the features of decision-making in the conditions of uncertainty.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
We will look at some techniques for adopting rational and creative decisions.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
We will also focus on common mistakes, typical mistakes,

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
that are made by leaders and ordinary people when making rational decisions.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
It should be noted that this video course is a logical continuation of the courses

01:15.000 --> 01:25.000
on management research, qualitative research, management research, quantitative research,

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
as well as development courses and decision-making.

01:30.000 --> 01:41.000
And they will certainly be more useful to managers who already have experience in making decisions in their professional activities.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
And in their professional activities, managers are always associated with the process of development, adoption and implementation of management decisions.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
The decisions that the manager makes should be justified and balanced.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Moreover, they should be fulfilled.

02:02.000 --> 02:13.000
Unfortunately, in management situations, decisions are often made in the conditions of uncertainty.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
That is, the decision has a probability nature.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
And the unpredictability of the results will be higher than the level of professionalism of the manager

02:27.000 --> 02:39.000
and lower knowledge in the field of technology, development and adoption of management decisions.

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
In management, the decision connects almost all aspects of the manager's activities,

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
starting with the purpose of the position, description and objective assessment of the situation,

02:54.000 --> 03:05.000
forecasting of the result and, in fact, determines the effectiveness of the functioning of all systems and business processes.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
The goals and tasks set within this video course flow from above.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
First of all, this task is to show the role and importance of conducting research in the preparation of management research,

03:23.000 --> 03:32.000
as I have already said, to familiarize with some techniques, techniques of making rational and creative decisions

03:32.000 --> 03:43.000
and to analyze typical mistakes made by managers in terms of knowledge, ignorance and sometimes sensibility.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Let's start with the first topic.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.000
Let's talk about the procedures that accompany the decision based on the research.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
In the slide, you see the definition of a management decision.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
This is a directive act of purposeful influence on the management object, and so on.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
It is emphasized that the decision must be made based on the analysis of reliable data.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Each word here has its own weight.

04:27.000 --> 04:37.000
Analysis is possible, but analysis is needed only when you are sure of the data you have received.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
And you can get reliable data only by conducting certain research.

04:46.000 --> 05:04.000
And, of course, the definition of the purpose of the action, as well as the composition of the plan or the program of achieving this goal, plays an important role and importance in a management decision.

05:04.000 --> 05:13.000
We will not talk for a long time about the classification of management decisions.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
We have already talked about this a little earlier.

05:15.000 --> 05:25.000
Let me just remind you that, in time, decisions can be strategic, tactical or operational.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
The degree of participation of specialists in them can be individual, collective or collegial decisions.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
In terms of the maintenance of the management process, social, economic, organizational and technical.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
We are more interested in the last item on this list.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
In terms of the nature of decision-making, there are intuitive and rational decisions.

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
And a somewhat intermediate position between them is taken by decisions that are made on the basis of judgment.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
We will talk about this.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
Intuitive decisions are not really the subject of our discussion.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
But to emphasize the role and importance of rational decisions, let's talk a little about intuitive ones.

06:20.000 --> 06:40.000
Since the manager is constantly busy, busy, communicating with a large number of people, he often has to make decisions quickly, and he has no time to think.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
In such cases, he relies on his intuition.

06:46.000 --> 06:58.000
In principle, there is no big sin in this, because intuitive decisions are very often the only right thing to do.

06:58.000 --> 07:09.000
And yet, it should be noted that intuitive decisions have both positive and negative sides.

07:10.000 --> 07:21.000
When is it most correct to make intuitive decisions, that is, positive sides of this moment?

07:21.000 --> 07:34.000
First of all, intuitive decisions are most often based on when rational techniques are not suitable by several criteria.

07:34.000 --> 07:45.000
But it also happens that all the techniques seem to work, and the result is achieved with mathematical accuracy, and the manager feels something is wrong.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
The feeling tells you that you need to choose another alternative.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Sometimes you need to listen to yourself.

07:53.000 --> 08:09.000
The second positive aspect of intuitive decisions is that you don't need a lot of time or resources to make such decisions.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
And you can make a decision very quickly.

08:16.000 --> 08:28.000
But intuitive decisions have weaknesses that limit their value.

08:29.000 --> 08:52.000
The first one is that when we make an intuitive decision, we cannot tell anyone, including ourselves, what criteria we used to make this decision.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
This is where the following problems arise.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
It will be very difficult for us to explain to other people why we made this decision.

09:02.000 --> 09:18.000
Moreover, if we suddenly need to analyze this decision, no matter if it is a success or failure, we will not be able to repeat this experience.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
We will not be able to make a justification for why we need to act this way or that way in the next situation.

09:27.000 --> 09:54.000
Another important aspect of the fact that intuitive decisions are not always acceptable is that very often, when making an intuitive decision and often encountering failures, the manager can become very vulnerable to manipulation.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
Nevertheless, we cannot refuse to make intuitive decisions.

10:02.000 --> 10:25.000
The subjective moment in making a decision is always present, but the manager's task is to make a management decision, and leave the subjective moment, his preference, as it were, in the background.

10:26.000 --> 10:41.000
If we now move on to rational decisions, it is important to note that a rational decision is called rational because it must be scientifically justified.

10:41.000 --> 10:54.000
That is, it must be based on the knowledge of objective laws, regardless of the field, management of staff, finances, and so on.

10:54.000 --> 11:18.000
It must be based on the results of research, and the manager must have a good scientific foresight of how the events will develop after the decision is made.

11:18.000 --> 11:33.000
As I said, the middle ground between intuitive and rational decisions is based on judgment.

11:33.000 --> 11:50.000
What is the difference? In essence, the manager makes a judgment when he has previous experience of making decisions in similar situations that have happened in the past.

11:50.000 --> 12:02.000
This is the subconsciously acquired information that allows him to act as an expert in making a management decision.

12:02.000 --> 12:14.000
There are only two buts that limit the use of decisions based on judgment.

12:14.000 --> 12:28.000
The first is that all situations in business are unique and cannot be repeated with precision until the third sign after the comma.

12:28.000 --> 12:46.000
Situations change, people change, external and internal circumstances change, so the previous decision cannot be completely transferred to the current situation.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
It must be adapted to the current situation.

12:51.000 --> 13:05.000
The second limiting point is that in a practical situation, when there are many factors influencing a decision,

13:06.000 --> 13:29.000
it is very difficult for a person without any knowledge of computer programs, analysis programs, and so on, and sometimes it is almost impossible to take all these factors into account, especially in their mutual influence on each other.

13:29.000 --> 13:39.000
And now it's time to say, what is the purpose of a decision?

13:39.000 --> 13:50.000
As a rule, a decision is made with a certain goal or several goals, which is also very common.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
What is a goal?

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
By definition, it is the ideal representation of the desired result.

13:59.000 --> 14:18.000
From this definition, it follows that the first and main task of a manager in preparing for making a management decision is to realize the goal that he wants to achieve in the ideal case.

14:18.000 --> 14:31.000
And the goal of any decision is to get rid of uncertainty in the future.

14:31.000 --> 14:46.000
If we talk about goals, there are a lot of goals written in the literature, we will only talk about those features that are interesting for the purposes of our video course.

14:47.000 --> 14:58.000
First of all, it should be noted that goals can be multiple, including mutually excluding.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
What do multiple goals mean?

15:03.000 --> 15:17.000
Let's say you decided to have a corporate holiday. What is the purpose of a corporate holiday now?

15:17.000 --> 15:45.000
It can be to please employees, it can be an incentive for the management team, it can be a PR campaign if you invite people who are influential or who depend on the well-being of your company.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
You can list them for a very long time.

15:49.000 --> 15:59.000
The next feature of goals can be defined as hidden goals.

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
This is a very serious and very problematic area in the manager's goals.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
What is a hidden goal?

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
A goal that is not announced in the public, but is kept inside a person.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Goals can be hidden for very different reasons.

16:24.000 --> 16:35.000
For example, a person pursues his personal goals, but cannot express them publicly.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
For example, a meeting is scheduled at the end of the working day.

16:42.000 --> 16:53.000
A person says, no, it is completely pointless to hold a meeting at the end of the working day, people are already tired, let's do it the next morning.

16:53.000 --> 17:04.000
On the one hand, it seems to be a concern for people, for colleagues, on the other hand, it is quite possible that this person has a date today.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
There are also reasons for hiding true goals.

17:12.000 --> 17:28.000
Sometimes a true goal is hidden if a person assumes that his goal does not correspond to the official goals, for example, proposed by the management.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
And in order not to spoil his relationship, he will keep silent about his hidden goal.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
There are times when a decision must be made in a group.

17:47.000 --> 17:57.000
In this case, the presence of hidden goals can make it very, very difficult to make decisions.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
If several people have their hidden goals.

18:02.000 --> 18:23.000
Therefore, the task of the manager, when setting goals, is to first of all not only determine, realize his own goal, but also find out what hidden goals other participants of the process may pursue.

18:24.000 --> 18:33.000
Well, the last thing to explain a little is the purpose of preference.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
Preference is a very interesting category.

18:40.000 --> 18:55.000
In fact, making a decision in 99 cases is a preference for one or another possible alternative.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
Preference is always subjective.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Therefore, we can say that there are no best decisions.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
The decision is always the best.

19:07.000 --> 19:19.000
Only for a specific situation, only in specific conditions, only for a specific person making the decision.

19:20.000 --> 19:28.000
We have already said that the decision must be made on the basis of certain studies.

19:28.000 --> 19:41.000
And the study is carried out in order to get information that the manager lacks to make a reasonable decision.

19:42.000 --> 19:59.000
Information is the data that reduces the uncertainty in the knowledge of the manager, of any subject making a decision about the object of management or decision.

19:59.000 --> 20:16.000
Information is divided into subconscious, subject and formal statistical data.

20:16.000 --> 20:34.000
Subconscious information is the information that a person has accumulated as a result of previous experience, study of the current situation, and so on.

20:34.000 --> 20:50.000
Subconscious information is the information about the subject obtained on the basis of the studies, the setting of the experiment, and so on.

20:50.000 --> 21:04.000
And the formal statistical data is what allows you to get a certain kind of mathematical apparatus.

21:05.000 --> 21:14.000
All information contributes to the movement from uncertainty to certainty.

21:14.000 --> 21:32.000
In order to formulate the situation, in order to analyze the processes and situations reliably, in order to prepare a reasonable management decision.

21:34.000 --> 21:49.000
In terms of awareness of the manager in relation to different types of information,

21:49.000 --> 22:15.000
three possible situations are classified in practical and theoretical sources, depending on the information potential of the manager making the decision.

22:15.000 --> 22:25.000
On the one hand, this can be setting goals in conditions of complete certainty of the external and internal environment.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
What does complete certainty mean?

22:28.000 --> 22:40.000
This means that the manager probably knows what result will be the result of his decision.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
But there are very few such situations in business.

22:45.000 --> 23:01.000
Of course, it is possible to evaluate qualitatively that if we do this, we will succeed, if we do otherwise, it will lead to failure.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Such situations in real life practically do not happen.

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
Even if there is certainty, there is still a possibility that it will be either better or worse.

23:14.000 --> 23:23.000
Therefore, even in the conditions of certainty, the manager must justify his decision.

23:23.000 --> 23:34.000
Most often, the setting of goals is carried out in conditions of either complete or incomplete certainty.

23:35.000 --> 23:53.000
That is, when the manager does not know what events will occur, what factors will affect the development of the situation, how they will affect the result of the decision.

23:53.000 --> 24:11.000
And in fact, the success of the manager in professional activity will depend on the intensity of the manifestation of certain outcomes or results of the decision.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Now let's move on to topic 2.

24:18.000 --> 24:31.000
Let's talk about making decisions in the condition of uncertainty, which happens most often in practical life situations in professional manager activity.

24:31.000 --> 24:42.000
Under uncertainty, in this case, the incompleteness or inaccuracy of information about the conditions of achieving the planned result is understood.

24:43.000 --> 24:54.000
In addition, uncertainty can be formed by the presence of factors of chance and contradiction.

24:54.000 --> 25:03.000
The adoption of managerial decisions in the conditions of uncertainty has its own specifics.

25:04.000 --> 25:25.000
In fact, the choice of each option of decision means that several actions can be taken, and the consequence of these actions will not be one, but many outcomes.

25:26.000 --> 25:34.000
And the probability of their occurrence is absolutely unknown or does not make sense.

25:35.000 --> 25:53.000
It should also be noted that when making decisions in the conditions of uncertainty, each fixed alternative corresponds not to one completely certain, but to many results.

25:54.000 --> 26:07.000
Therefore, the choice of the only one, the best alternative for a particular situation or for a particular person is significantly difficult.

26:08.000 --> 26:21.000
Uncertainty in different managerial situations is always determined by three factors.

26:21.000 --> 26:46.000
The first factor is the lack of complete information, which can be supplemented under certain conditions, as well as by chance or contradiction, which can sometimes be foreseen, and sometimes it is absolutely impossible.

26:47.000 --> 27:02.000
What is chance? Chance is what happens in the initial conditions is not the same, and therefore it is absolutely impossible to say with certainty what will happen this time.

27:02.000 --> 27:26.000
Every year we have winter. This is a standard phenomenon, but it is impossible to say that an abundant snowfall will happen on the day when you planned to transport a particularly valuable cargo.

27:26.000 --> 27:43.000
In the world of chance, a special mathematical apparatus has been developed for working in the world of chance, and probability theories are studied about the pattern.

27:43.000 --> 28:08.000
Without going deep into this issue, let's just say that the probability of any event fluctuates from 0 to 1. If the probability is 0, then the event cannot occur. If the probability of an event is estimated as 1, then such a phenomenon is classified as reliable.

28:09.000 --> 28:26.000
Probability estimates allow us to give a qualitative and quantitative, which is especially important, characteristic of future events, random events.

28:26.000 --> 28:50.000
We also noted such a factor as a contradiction. Any action has a contradiction.

28:50.000 --> 28:58.000
Whatever the manager does, there will always be something that will resist or contradict him.

28:59.000 --> 29:20.000
A very large number of phenomena can be classified as such. These may be natural disasters, violations of contractual obligations, accidents, banal thefts.

29:20.000 --> 29:42.000
These may be the resistance of people who consider your decision to be wrong and take certain actions to oppose the implementation of this decision.

29:42.000 --> 30:07.000
The manager must, if in the case of an accident, excuse this tautology, very often there are situations when the manager cannot predict with a sufficient degree of confidence about the possibility, probability of the occurrence,

30:07.000 --> 30:25.000
then in the event of a contradiction, the direct task of the manager is to study possible places, situations where the implementation of the decision will be opposed.

30:25.000 --> 30:44.000
This can help him, including the correctly set goals of a specific study on the study of situations where and how this contradiction can manifest itself.

30:44.000 --> 31:13.000
As I said, if the manager does not have enough information to make a decision, then the only recommendation is that you need to spend time and certain resources to get additional information.

31:14.000 --> 31:33.000
In order to reduce the level of uncertainty, otherwise you will have to act on a guess, relying on experience and intuition. We do not diminish the importance of intuition, but we say that a rational decision should be justified.

31:33.000 --> 32:02.000
Since the decision is made in the condition of uncertainty, the concept of risk is associated with it. There is always a possibility to lose something, to part with something that flows out of the specifics of the activity of human society.

32:03.000 --> 32:12.000
And when making a decision, the manager must assess the risks.

32:33.000 --> 33:02.000
In other words, for the manager, there is an indivisible degree of risk, first of all, the obtain of adverse results for him due to the uncertainty of the situation.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
The risk can be very high.

33:33.000 --> 34:02.000
In the case when the manager makes a justified decision in the condition of risk, it is very important for him to reduce the number of basic components that are involved in the decision.

34:03.000 --> 34:29.000
The number of components, the criteria that are involved in determining the outcome, that is, to simplify the situation. Then it will be easier to assess the degree of susceptibility to possible losses or to assess the possibility of obtaining certain benefits.

34:29.000 --> 34:42.000
We have already said the word alternative more than once, that is, an option of possible solutions.

34:59.000 --> 35:26.000
The least risky alternative is the one that is more confident in the judgments of the outcome, where it is possible to more accurately assess the degree of risk.

35:26.000 --> 35:53.000
The most acceptable or the least risky alternative is the one that gives the most benefit in the event of an offensive.

35:53.000 --> 36:06.000
Accordingly, the least losses and the least possibility of being subject to an adverse outcome.

36:23.000 --> 36:44.000
This is the goal of the decision-making theory.

36:45.000 --> 36:57.000
This is not an easy task. In fact, the formation of efficiency criteria is one of the most complex problems in the theory and practice of management.

36:57.000 --> 37:07.000
It is connected with the transformation of goals and the ideal vision of the person making the decision in measurable quantities.

37:07.000 --> 37:22.000
That is, we emphasize once again that the criteria are set by the person making the decision, based on their preferences.

37:22.000 --> 37:36.000
I highlight two areas of practical application of the criteria.

37:36.000 --> 37:52.000
In the first case, they are used to assess the actual events. And the second is used in the process of making decisions to assess future outcomes.

37:52.000 --> 38:09.000
In both cases, the essential characteristics remain the same. That is, the purpose of the efficiency criteria is to measure the properties and relations in the system.

38:09.000 --> 38:21.000
The second general point is the orientation to the final goal and task of the organization, including its mission.

38:21.000 --> 38:35.000
If we talk about the criteria for assessing the future, then here it is necessary to note two points.

38:35.000 --> 38:58.000
The first is that as we move into the future, the uncertainty of the situation increases and the information potential decreases.

38:58.000 --> 39:07.000
That is, we can only estimate the probability of the onset of one or another event.

39:07.000 --> 39:32.000
And the second point is that as the predicted period increases, that is, we predict for a year, two or twenty years, the number of various alternatives increases many times.

39:32.000 --> 39:47.000
This is objective. There is no point in fighting this, but you need to be ready for this and form the efficiency criteria accordingly.

39:47.000 --> 40:00.000
There are four basic principles for forming the efficiency criteria.

40:00.000 --> 40:13.000
The first one says that in the conditions of a systemic crisis in the economy, the corresponding system of criteria and restrictions is required to solve the problems that have arisen.

40:13.000 --> 40:36.000
The second principle is that the formation of a system of criteria and restrictions must correspond to the principle of consistent reduction of uncertainty.

40:36.000 --> 41:03.000
The third principle says that the formation of efficiency criteria, as we have already said above, must be necessarily associated with and conditioned by the mission of the organization and its ultimate goals.

41:03.000 --> 41:25.000
And the last principle, the fourth principle, says that the system of efficiency criteria must be organically integrated into the human-machine system.

41:25.000 --> 41:52.000
Of course, the human component in these systems is decisive, but for complex, multi-plan solutions, oriented towards the long-term perspective, it is not possible to make a decision without taking part in the process.

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
This is the main advantage of modern information technology.

42:02.000 --> 42:15.000
In addition to the principles, there are certain conditions for forming the efficiency criteria.

42:15.000 --> 42:32.000
The first condition is that the efficiency criteria must be quantitative, that is, expressed in numbers and have a real physical meaning.

42:32.000 --> 42:40.000
That is, there should not be any abstraction, each in its own way understandable.

42:41.000 --> 42:55.000
The second condition for the efficiency criteria says that the criteria must be determined with sufficient accuracy, without large costs and time loss.

42:55.000 --> 43:11.000
In addition, the efficiency criteria must meet the requirements of completeness, that is, reflect the significant aspects of the object or phenomenon studied.

43:11.000 --> 43:30.000
An important condition for the criteria is that the criteria must be assigned an accurate action algorithm when solving any problem from a variety of data.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
What does an accurate action algorithm mean?

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
In fact, we set a certain kind of limitation.

43:38.000 --> 43:52.000
We say, if we get some kind of profitability value in 5 years, then we can make this decision.

43:52.000 --> 43:59.000
In this case, the profitability of the enterprise will act as a criteria for efficiency.

43:59.000 --> 44:09.000
Otherwise, if the criteria do not meet the critical value, then the algorithm should be different.

44:09.000 --> 44:18.000
That is, we must either refuse this alternative or change the task.

44:18.000 --> 44:33.000
And the last one. Each selected criteria for efficiency must clearly reflect the usefulness of a separate alternative.

44:33.000 --> 44:39.000
We will talk a little later about how the criteria for usefulness are considered.

44:39.000 --> 44:58.000
Here is an example of what criteria can be applied in this particular simple tactical solution.

44:58.000 --> 45:05.000
Although, no, probably not tactical. It can be evaluated not as a tactical solution.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
The task is to find a place for the public reception room.

45:13.000 --> 45:34.000
In this case, the minimum area of the room, maximum costs for this room, and the location of this room is considered an important criterion for the owner of this problem.

45:34.000 --> 45:44.000
Including in this concept of location and access roads and parking, possibly guarded parking, and so on.

45:44.000 --> 46:01.000
Since we said that the criteria must be expressed quantitatively and clearly interpret a certain order of actions,

46:01.000 --> 46:10.000
then in this case, all these three listed criteria are required to be assigned digital values.

46:10.000 --> 46:18.000
That is, what should be the minimum area, what should be the maximum costs, and so on.

46:18.000 --> 46:36.000
That is, only by fulfilling all the conditions that we have listed above, we can make our own one or another alternative solution.

46:36.000 --> 46:58.000
But if we look at these criteria from a different point of view, it is quite possible that some of them will have more value when making a decision, and some of them will have less value.

46:58.000 --> 47:21.000
That is, we are talking about the fact that it is important not only to determine the absolute size of the criterion, but also to give it weight, as they say, to calculate the coefficient of weight, or to give it certain points, fixing the importance of the criterion.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
You can fix the importance of a particular criterion in the form of points.

47:27.000 --> 47:36.000
And for clarity, you can make such a simple matrix table.

47:36.000 --> 47:50.000
Without even sticking to the above example, but in the general scheme, we have three alternatives and three criteria.

47:50.000 --> 47:57.000
We assign them point values, and then everything is very simple.

47:57.000 --> 48:12.000
In this case, alternative number two gets more points and, accordingly, is recognized as the best from a mathematical point of view.

48:12.000 --> 48:29.000
However, it should be noted that this does not mean that this particular alternative should be chosen as the best, because mathematics and life sometimes diverge in making decisions.

48:29.000 --> 48:56.000
Here, when making a decision, it can play a role in the preferences of the person making the decision and his intuitive feeling that, yes, alternative number two is good in all respects, but it is uncomfortable for me in this room.

48:56.000 --> 49:03.000
And I will not recommend it to the public reception organization.

49:03.000 --> 49:19.000
There are several ways to form criteria. Two of them are associated with a rather complex mathematical apparatus.

49:19.000 --> 49:37.000
And we will not consider them within the framework of this video course. We will focus only on the efficiency coefficient, which is calculated quite simply.

49:37.000 --> 49:55.000
In fact, you need to calculate how much resources will be spent in order to get the planned result.

49:55.000 --> 50:12.000
This criterion is most often used in conjunction with a whole system of restrictions that allow to ensure the reliability and reality of this indicator.

50:12.000 --> 50:31.000
When applying this method of creating efficiency criteria, the principle of comparison is implemented, in fact, the agreement of costs with results.

50:31.000 --> 50:55.000
That is, the efficiency of converting costs into results is assessed. The main drawback of this method of measuring efficiency is that the indicators of the numerator and denominator can be arbitrarily varied.

50:55.000 --> 51:13.000
And if the values of the numerator and denominator are chosen incorrectly or inadequately, this can lead to a distorted value of the efficiency coefficient.

51:13.000 --> 51:33.000
So, if you put a small number in the numerator, it can significantly affect the assessment of efficiency.

51:33.000 --> 51:50.000
That is, we are talking about the fact that if you plan to get a small result, but you think that you have spent a lot on it, then the efficiency coefficient will be greatly reduced.

51:50.000 --> 52:03.000
It can be said that a lot of good decisions is a combination of incomparable decisions, each of which is impossible to improve.

52:03.000 --> 52:20.000
Thus, this is a certain stage of making a management decision. The manager is given several options, each of which is good in its own way.

52:20.000 --> 52:36.000
And the next stage will be the informalization of the decision, that is, giving preference to one or another option.

52:36.000 --> 53:05.000
Thus, if there is no information about the probability values of the state of the environment, in fact, the theory does not give unambiguous, mathematically strict recommendations on the choice of criteria.

53:05.000 --> 53:25.000
As we have already said, the manager has several options, and he must, based on his intuition, his judgment, his preferences, choose one or the other.

53:25.000 --> 53:44.000
He still has the opportunity to get additional information by conducting research, but it still remains more or less subjective.

53:44.000 --> 54:03.000
This can cause a complaint that the theory is weak. But the point is not in the theory, but in the fact that the situation cannot become definite to the end.

54:03.000 --> 54:18.000
Then one wonders why so many words, so many theories, definitions, and so on, for the description of the process of preparation for making a decision. What is the point?

54:33.000 --> 54:51.000
And to some extent they protect the person who makes them from manipulation, insure them in the event of future decisions, and so on.

54:51.000 --> 55:10.000
That is, of course, all this is extremely important, necessary and useful.

55:10.000 --> 55:27.000
The management decision-making process offers several methods of removing uncertainty from the future situation. One of these methods is the method of predictive scenarios.

55:27.000 --> 55:52.000
This method includes certain methods, step by step.

55:52.000 --> 56:03.000
In this tutorial, all steps are prescribed.

56:03.000 --> 56:14.000
The predictive scenario of the situation development is built in the event of making a decision.

56:14.000 --> 56:29.000
It should be emphasized, as I said, that the effective implementation of this method is possible only when special information systems are used.

56:30.000 --> 56:45.000
This is especially true for the last two or three steps, which cannot be done without special information systems.

56:45.000 --> 57:02.000
What else should be noted? The method of predictive scenarios is closely related to the analysis method.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
Analysis cannot exist without it.

57:32.000 --> 57:39.000
This is one of the tasks of the analysis method.

57:39.000 --> 57:49.000
The second task is to assess the potential threats and weaknesses of the organization in the future.

57:49.000 --> 57:55.000
And how this will affect its predictable state.

57:55.000 --> 58:02.000
This is also one of the significant sections of the analysis method.

58:02.000 --> 58:17.000
The third task is to assess the management decisions and how they will affect the trajectory of the organization's development.

58:17.000 --> 58:30.000
What is the area of permissible alternatives and the implemented solutions and their consequences.

58:31.000 --> 58:46.000
The scenario is a hypothetical, imaginary picture of the subsequent development of the situation, space and time.

58:46.000 --> 59:00.000
All those events that make up the overall evolution of the organization in the interest of the researcher.

59:01.000 --> 59:28.000
The scenario must contain and be clearly described the causal links that determine the possible dynamics of the system's state changes and the impact of which these changes will occur.

59:28.000 --> 59:43.000
The scenario can be formally described as follows.

59:43.000 --> 01:00:03.000
The abbreviation for this model is the past situation, the initial situation and the future situation.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:18.000
The real past and the initial situation are marked with solid lines, and the punctirum is a subjective representation of the person about the situation.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000
In fact, the area outside the intersection is the degree of uncertainty.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000
The right part of the picture is sometimes called a tube, a scenario tube.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:55.000
In different conditions, this tube can be wider or narrower, depending on the goals and tasks that are pursued and how far the horizon is from the initial situation.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The properties of the scenario allow to significantly narrow the initial uncertainty, including by introducing indicators of the state,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and allow to build a tube of permissible trajectories of the development of the research systems that can be used in the process of preparation, adoption and implementation of the management solution.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
An indicator is a parameter of the system that is critical to the state of the limit.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:41.000
As indicators, the parameters that can be expressed in numbers are chosen.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And the limit values of these indicators are set.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Why are they called indicators?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Because when the indicator goes beyond a certain limit, it will mean the system is unstable or its transition to a different state or even the death of the system.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:38.000
As an indicator, a certain share of the revenue, for example, can be a part of the revenue of the public reception room.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:48.000
As a criterion, the size of the rental fee can be an indicator.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
We will not go through the step-by-step methodology.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It is described in detail in the textbook.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000
There are also quite complex drawings, which are difficult to reproduce on slides.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Therefore, I suggest you get acquainted with it yourself.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Rational decision-making

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And we are moving on to the third topic of the technique of making rational decisions.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Within the framework of one video course, it is difficult to disassemble all the techniques.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
We will focus on three of them.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:49.000
This is the method of equal exchange, the tree of decisions and the cause-and-effect analysis.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Those who have made decisions in their life know well that tasks with a single goal are extremely rare.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Usually, there are several goals.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And in order to make a decision on several goals, the most rational and, at the same time, the most difficult option for solving the problem is to establish a compromise.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And the more compromises you have to look for, the more difficult the situation, the more options there are for solving this problem.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And the more goals the person making the decision pursues, the more preferences he has.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Peter Drucker, a well-known guru in the field of management, believes that the best solution lies between necessary and erroneous compromises.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000
A good leader is experienced enough to understand the difference between them.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The method that is offered for your consideration and which allows you to find a compromise solution to complex tasks with several options of choice was proposed by John Hammond with the authors.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And it was called the method of equal exchange, which is essentially a barter deal.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
To exchange one option for another.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:06:02.000
We cannot claim that the application of the method of equal exchange will help you make a difficult solution simple.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:14.000
There will still be a difficult choice between what is desirable to achieve and what will have to be sacrificed.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But the main advantage of the method of equal exchange is that it makes you use a rational, weighted approach to evaluating each compromise.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And, in fact, it allows you to make the right decision.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:48.000
The method of equal exchange is quite difficult to reproduce in a video course.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It is better to work it out with a pencil in hand and in front of a sheet of paper.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:10.000
The manual says that you need to first develop several alternative solutions to the problem, to draw up a so-called table of consequences.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
For example, this is all well disassembled.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And then, by the method of exception, reduce the number of possible alternative solutions and already between the remaining ones, find a compromise solution.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:45.000
The next method, which is widely used in the theory of decision-making, is the tree of solutions.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:55.000
The main principle of its construction is the following three points.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
First, you need to formulate a problem.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
This problem is written in the very top corner of the sheet.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:15.000
And from this starting point, so-called point, two or more branches go further.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Usually, there are two branches, because most often at the first stage we answer the question of whether to do it or not.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
To take or not to take, to give or not to give, for example, a loan, and so on.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And, in fact, these branches denote possible solutions to the problem.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
What direction will these branches take?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
In fact, it does not play a big role.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
There are options when the branches go down from the top point.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:55.000
There are solutions when the branches go to the right from the starting point.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
In fact, it does not change.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But at subsequent levels there are subordinate elements.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
There are three of them.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
These are the solution, the event or state, and the consequences.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Each of them is denoted by a conditional sign.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000
For solutions, this is a circle, for events and states, a square, and for consequences, a triangle.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:34.000
From these initial solutions, the following solutions, states or consequences can be branched off.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And thus a branched tree is built.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And so it continues until the level when the person making the decision, in general,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
branched off to the last level of consequences or preliminary results.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
The following is important when building a branched tree.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
The following is important.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
At each level, there should be only elements of one type.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Elements of only one type.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000
That is, either only a solution, or only a state, or only consequences.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.000
The most common practice of making a decision, building a branched tree,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
is a three-layer model.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
The first layer with possible solutions follows the initial question,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
one of which can be chosen.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Then the second layer of events is introduced, which can occur after this decision has been made.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
And the third layer already contains consequences in each relevant case.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:07.000
A branched tree allows to clearly imagine possible solutions along with their consequences

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and to get an idea of the probability of certain consequences.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.000
An example of a graphical image of a branched tree

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:30.000
for the task of vaccinating against the flu or not is shown on the slide.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It is also given in a textbook and has been analyzed in detail.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
What should be added to this?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The internal nodes of the tree, such as the presence of temperature, infection,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
are called the attributes of the database.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000
These attributes are called predictors or attributes of the split.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:04.000
In this place, or in the branching point,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000
there is a split into possible alternative directions of action.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Such a graphical image of the solutions, states and consequences

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
helps to make the right decision.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:35.000
To analyze the consequences, it is necessary to introduce something like a common denominator,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
namely, the criteria for assessment.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
These criteria can be both objective and subjective,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000
that is, a certain kind of judgment and preference of the person making the decision.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:00.000
If, as we said, the goal of making the decision is not one,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:08.000
then in this case, the tree of solutions should be built on several models.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:20.000
We have received a number of alternatives for making decisions.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It is advisable to build them in a certain hierarchical order, that is, according to priorities.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Perhaps, they can be given a negative rating, starting from 0, which is extremely undesirable,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
to 10, which is considered excellent, absolutely acceptable.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Thus, again, between a number of alternatives, you can choose the most favorable one.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:04.000
The construction of the tree of solutions is not as simple as it may seem at first glance.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:13.000
The fact is that, as you can see from the diagram,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
the probability of the onset of certain consequences is calculated.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
But as for determining the probability of the onset of these consequences,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
the task is not always easy, and sometimes it is impossible to fulfill.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Therefore, in practice, when building a tree of solutions,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
two methods are used.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:51.000
If it is possible to obtain statistical data and calculate the probability of certain consequences,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
then the task is simplified and the solution is more reasonable.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:09.000
If this is not possible, then the probability values can be given in the assumed order,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
which, as you understand, significantly reduces the objectivity of the decision.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:24.000
What is the meaning and value of the tree of solutions?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000
First of all, it is that the model clearly shows

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000
what consequences certain solutions may have,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and certain events, and thus help the person making the decision

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:54.000
to structure his thoughts, see the general picture of the development of the problem,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and the consequences of making a decision.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:08.000
The next method is the cause-and-effect analysis.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:19.000
We talked a little about it when we were considering the course of the method of making management decisions.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But then we were interested in how the method allows us to analyze

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:36.000
the cause-and-effect connections between the data and the events during the study.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
When preparing a management decision,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
the cause-and-effect analysis plays an extremely important role and importance.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Its main goal is to identify the cause-and-effect connections between the conditions and events,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
to see what is due to what,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000
and, based on this analysis, to determine the dependence of some variables on others.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Since there are no simple events in the world,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
let's say, two-level events,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:34.000
and, as a rule, this forms a whole chain of causes and effects,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:49.000
the cause-and-effect analysis aims to determine the hierarchy of these causes and effects,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:56.000
which starts from the point of the current state, the initial state,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:10.000
and leads back to the point where the problem needs to be diagnosed in order to be solved.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.000
An example of the cause-and-effect chain is shown on the slide.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:27.000
The problem that the manager faced is that a valuable employee is fired from the marketing department.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:38.000
The scheme allows us to trace what was the primary reason for the firing of a valuable employee.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:47.000
If we look closely at this scheme, we will see that there are many problems in this organization,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and the primary reason for the situation was the absence of a planning system in the marketing department.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Then, the problem of a snow coma actually arose,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:15.000
but the importance and value of such a scheme is to solve not only this minute problem,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:24.000
but also to determine the causes of this problem in order to correct the situation.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:33.000
When conducting an analysis, it is very important to follow a certain sequence.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And as I have repeatedly said, repeating the theorists in the field of decision-making,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000
the most important thing is a correctly, clearly formulated problem.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Then, there is a mandatory identification of the cause or several causes of the problem,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:08.000
an explanation of the circumstances that caused the problem, and then a check of the significance,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
that is, whether the connection of two variables is statistically significant or not.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:28.000
When we talk about statistics, about the assessment of probability states,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:40.000
it is necessary to mention the so-called mistakes of the first and second order,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:48.000
which are important not only for the cause of the investigative analysis when solving problems,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.000
but also in a number of other life situations.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:04.000
The mistake of the first order is that the conclusion is made about the truth of some statement,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:11.000
when this statement is not true.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
For example, if we talk about the cause of the investigative analysis,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
then you can mistakenly conclude that two variables are connected to each other,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
while in fact there is no connection between them.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:34.000
The mistake of the second order is that you consider some statement to be untrue,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
while it is actually true.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
That is, if we talk about the cause of the investigative analysis,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
then we conclude in the case of the second order of the mistake

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:57.000
that two variables are not connected, but they are actually connected to each other.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Usually, the mistake of the first order is considered more serious,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
trying to reduce the probability of its conclusion.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And minimizing the possibility of the occurrence of a mistake of the first order is much more important

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000
than reducing the probability of the second order.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Maybe it doesn't look very clear. Let's try to illustrate this with examples.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:50.000
The division of error solutions into mistakes of the first and second order

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.000
is also caused by the fact that the consequences of different types of error solutions

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000
are fundamentally different in that the lost win

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000
has less impact on the situation than the won win.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
For example, for a stockbroker, the consequences of not buying the stock

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000
when it should have been bought are different from the consequences of buying the stock,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
but it should not have been bought.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
This is the first mistake of the first order.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:41.000
The first situation in this case will mean that the lost profit could have been earned, but it did not.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And the second situation, when the shares were bought, but it was not necessary to do this,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
is direct losses up to the broker's bankruptcy.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And one more example.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:05.000
For a general, starting a military operation that will be lost is much worse

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.000
than missing a situation when a successful operation could have been carried out.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The last example can be actually completely transferred to the practice of real business.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Yes?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
What else should be noted?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And this is important.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000
When conducting a cause-and-effect analysis, it is always necessary to work methodically

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000
and study all the collected information very carefully.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And based on the collected data, make a mental conclusion.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Could the assumed cause actually lead to the observed effect?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:10.000
With all the apparent consistency of the cause and effect,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
in practice, this is not always obvious.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:24.000
We cannot say what is the primary reason, a bad working environment in the team

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
or poor performance indicators of the work.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
You need to study every specific case.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And one more point.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
It is necessary to keep in mind that if elimination,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
this is like a criterion,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:55.000
if the elimination of one assumed cause does not lead to the disappearance of the observed effect,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.000
then this clearly indicates that the primary cause has not been identified.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
In this case, the question arises, what to do?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Well, there are several possible methods of conduct.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000
On the one hand, you can try to check this, this and this by the method of elimination.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.000
In practice, most often there is not enough time or other resources

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
to check all the causes and primaries.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Here you can, again, refer to the Pareto principle

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and see, identify the main root causes,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:52.000
and leave the secondary causes for further analysis.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
If we talk about the features of the cause of the investigative analysis,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
then it is necessary to focus on the following points.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000
The cause and the consequence, the primary cause, we have already talked about them.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
The depth of the chain of causes and consequences,

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
and also the multiple causes of one consequence,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
or vice versa, the multiple consequences of one cause.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Both options are possible.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
We have partially already talked about the cause and the consequence.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
It should be added that the cause and the consequence can be conditioned on each other.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And the task of the person who conducts the analysis is to see

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:45.000
what this mutual influence is and what affects what.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:57.000
The primary cause is the starting point that provoked the emergence of the problem of the snowball coma.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Or the cause chain.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And the third aspect is necessary to talk about.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:18.000
The depth of the cause and consequence chain, in principle, can be very large.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000
But it is not always reasonable to do this.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:30.000
The task of the person who conducts the cause-and-consequence analysis

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000
is to have an accurate understanding of where to stop.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
That is, you don't need to dig until, I don't know, some archaic times,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000
but it is quite enough to stop, let's say, at the third or fifth level.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Everything else will be without almost unproductive waste of time and resources.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.000
As for the multiple causes of one consequence,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
this is a very common phenomenon in organizations.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Yes, and in private life too.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Probably, everyone is familiar with the fact that suddenly events are formed in such a way

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000
that one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing happens,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:28.000
and their complexity causes the emergence of one or another problem.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:40.000
But in reverse order, a number of consequences can arise from one cause.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:51.000
If we take as an example what you have described in the textbook,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:59.000
then, for example, the presence of an ethnic group can cause a number of problems

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:06.000
for the leadership of this organization or company.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:17.000
In order to make a decision, you need to develop certain criteria.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
We talked about efficiency criteria.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Let's look at the term criteria in a slightly different way.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
According to the term criteria, in the theory of decision-making,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
criteria denote a significant, understandable person making a decision,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
the characteristics, results of the operation.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And there are many alternatives in the field of criteria definition.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
For different alternatives, which is very important,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
a person's criteria can take on different meanings,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:04.000
which reflect the consciousness of the person who makes a decision

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:13.000
and express the degree of his preference for certain alternatives.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:22.000
In theory, there is a rule for decision-making.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.000
If one alternative is more preferable than the other,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:38.000
then this more preferable alternative should have a more preferable rating.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:45.000
That is, if we choose an alternative with a better rating,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.000
then it is believed that we choose the best alternative.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
As one of the criteria, when making a decision,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
the so-called rating of usefulness is applied,

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
which refers to direct methods.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:20.000
It is based on the assumption that the attitude of the person making the decision

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:25.000
can be represented by the function of usefulness.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And it can be expressed by the formula that is presented on the slide.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
It is read as follows.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Alternative A is no less preferable than alternative B.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Therefore, the function of usefulness should be no less important than that of alternative B.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Thus, it is only necessary to find an alternative that is most useful,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:20.000
and it will be the best for making a decision.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
From the perspective of mathematics,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:34.000
there can be several best alternatives with the highest ratings of usefulness,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:39.000
since the maximum of the function of usefulness can be achieved

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
by several elements of a multitude of definitions.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
In this case, we repeat once again,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:58.000
interpretations will help the manager to choose the best solution from the best with the help of preferences.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:08.000
When making a decision based on the criteria,

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000
the so-called Okama principle is very often used,

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
or the razor blade.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.000
This principle states that a razor blade does not multiply an entity without necessity.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And if we translate this into a simple language,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:40.000
it essentially means that if the same phenomenon can be explained by several different circumstances,

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000
and one of the circumstances is much simpler than the others,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000
then the preference should be given to a simpler explanation.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
To make it clear what the coefficient of the assessment of usefulness is,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000
let's take an example from the work of the marketing department.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:17.000
The criteria for the usefulness of marketing information are assessed as a ratio of the amount of useful,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:25.000
that is, the information they need, to the total amount of information coming from the source.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:34.000
For example, if a fax comes to the marketing department with a currency exchange rate of 10 foreign currencies,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
and the department uses only one position,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000
then the usefulness of the incoming information in this case will be equal to 1 tenth.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And then the criteria for usefulness are established, that is, its critical value.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:59.000
In this case, we can consider this source of information as useful,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.000
because the lower value of the criteria is set as 5 hundredths.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Another example.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:19.000
We all know that our computers are constantly subjected to the destructive effect of various viruses,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
and have long been accustomed to installing various antivirus programs.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:41.000
To this day, we understand that an antivirus program should be able to recognize and protect our computer from all known viruses.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:55.000
The function of the usefulness of a computer program in this case is determined by the ratio of the number of viruses caught to all existing ones.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000
However, the development of science and technology, including information technology,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:11.000
suggests that such an expression of the criteria for usefulness and safety no longer corresponds to reality.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:22.000
At present, it is already proposed to assess the usefulness of an antivirus program

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:31.000
by the ability of the antivirus program to detect unknown viruses.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:39.000
That is, it must recognize what is not embedded in the database.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
As we can see, the criteria are changing.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:55.000
It should be noted that when choosing a criteria, there are a number of restrictions that vary and depend on both the situation and the specific leaders.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
They are listed on your slide.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:05.000
This is the inadequacy of resources, that is, the lack of the necessary resources.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
These are personnel restrictions, financial restrictions.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I think this is understandable and does not require special comment.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
The restrictions of scientific and technical progress.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:23.000
That is, science, so to speak, does not yet offer solutions in this matter.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
These are market restrictions, including the actions of competitors.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:38.000
These are legal and moral ethical restrictions, which very often do not allow to make one or another decision.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And the restriction of authority when choosing a criterion.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:54.000
That is, not everyone who makes a decision has all the authority.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:05.000
In addition to these listed restrictions, there are also criteria that are called killers.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
This is a term that has developed.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:20.000
And killers are called those criteria that must be taken into account, otherwise the decision will simply not make sense.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
This can be explained by an elementary example.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:35.000
If a person has no driving license, he cannot look for a job as a private driver, so to speak, or just a driver.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:52.000
If a person, so to speak, has an allergy to flowers, then he will not go to rest where the grass is just blooming now, and so on.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And the second point by which the criterion can be called a killer is all those circumstances that a decision-maker would like to avoid.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Here we again face a subjective point, but this is a very important concept.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
It can be illustrated by the example.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:39.000
If a person is an introvert, it is difficult for him to work in communication with people, then he will probably not look for a job in the service sector, a job with clients,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.000
and most likely he will find a job in the production sector or in the back office.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Well, the time has come to choose an alternative.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
How is it done?

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.000
First of all, all possible options for solving the problem must be identified.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Then you need to limit the number of options for comparison with several alternatives using the above criteria, preferences, judgments, compromises, and so on.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Next, it is necessary to evaluate all the effective alternatives and compare them with each other for the next choice of the best of them.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:46.000
In this case, the assessment assumes the determination of both a positive and a negative effect of introducing an alternative solution.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Well, the final point is to choose an alternative.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:15.000
To choose the right alternative, it is necessary, as a rule, to take into account the previous experience, although, as we noted, you can not always rely entirely and completely on the past experience.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.000
The second is to conduct an experiment.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
And the third is to conduct a study and analysis.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:44.000
The past experience becomes a useful tool in making decisions if it is a thorough analysis, and not a blind follow-up to what has already been done.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
That is, a blind copy of what has already been done once.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Conducting an experiment.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Perhaps, for some alternatives, conducting an experiment is difficult or impossible.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:09.000
But if there is such an opportunity, then the experiment must be conducted.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
What is meant by the word experiment?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.000
This is an experiment to test alternatives in artificially created conditions.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Let's suppose that the developers of the passive safety systems of the car offer an alternative option of a safety pillow.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Artificial conditions can be created to test how the pillow will behave in certain artificially created extreme conditions, how it will contribute to the safety of the passenger, and so on.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:14.000
As for the study and analysis, the solution of the problem should be considered based on the search for the connections between its alternatives and the restrictions that are considered regarding the set goals.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:21.000
It is also useful to decompose the problem into separate components.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000
This is the essence of the analysis.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:38.000
To study each of these elements separately, so that after making a synthesis, you can come to a justified solution.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Thank you.
