How can we decompose strategic business goals and get to the Structural Division?

00:05.000 --> 00:18.000
Let's talk about how we can decompose strategic business goals and get to the Structural Division.

00:18.000 --> 00:30.000
If we have about 20 goals in the corporate map, we start decomposing them with the projection of personnel and business processes.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Usually, all the goals that we have stated in the projection of personnel and business processes are decomposed.

00:38.000 --> 00:49.000
We think about the activities and projects that need to be accomplished to achieve these goals, as well as the principles that need to be followed to achieve them.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Let's go back to the company that works in the kitchen furniture market.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
In the business process section, they have a goal that sounds like an increase in the quality and functionality of the product.

01:02.000 --> 01:17.000
At the strategic planning stage, the work in the mini-groups was decided that there are 6 main ideas that will contribute to the growth of the quality and functionality of the product.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
The company is going to implement the quality management methods of the 6SIGM system.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
There is such a fashionable system 6SIGM, and some thoughts seem very good to the company, and it is going to implement it.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
To increase the quality and functionality of the product, it is important for the production personnel to be interchangeable.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
The third point is that innovations should be introduced quickly.

01:41.000 --> 01:51.000
The company does not invent innovations, it actively learns from the Italians, Germans and Scandinavians and tries to master it quickly.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
It is clear that high-quality products need to be equipped with high-quality components.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
The company needs high-tech equipment with high level of automation.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
The production site where it is produced already has it, but it needs to be installed on two new production sites.

02:13.000 --> 02:24.000
In addition, the company is going to develop a corporate production standard, in which all the nuances of the production of the product will be described in as much detail as possible.

02:24.000 --> 02:37.000
Typical or most common mistakes will also be indicated, which employees at different stages of production of the product can make, and which can affect the quality and functionality of the finished cuisine.

02:38.000 --> 02:50.000
The goal of improving the quality and functionality of the product was broken down into sub-goals, which can be called events, tasks, projects and principles.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
The second example is the same company, the same business process project.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
The goal is to build a strong brand.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
A brand can be defined as a competitive idea.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
The company is trying to sell its clients Italy along with its own furniture.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
The promotion of the company is in every way a way to show off the Italian side.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
One of the principles stated in the event system is the bet on Italian.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
The channels of communication with clients are also prescribed.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
This is an advertising video on TV, an ad on the radio.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
This is a fairly important value for the company, as it gradually acquires advertising on the Internet and in the SME.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
In addition, some money will be spent on external advertising and corporate booklets plus catalogs.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
The website that the company has is now considered to be outdated.

03:56.000 --> 04:05.000
The company is going to remake it and invest money in it, considering it a very important tool for building a strong brand.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
This is how the goal of building a strong brand looks like in this business.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
This slide shows a list of their goals and indicators of the business level in general.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
You can see that the goal of increasing the business value is monitored through the indicator of the size of the capital.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
What is the value of the capital at a given time.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
The goal of increasing the profit is monitored through the indicator of the economic profit.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
The goal of increasing the satisfaction of the clients is tracked by two indicators.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
This is a complex index of satisfaction of the clients.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
They offer the clients to fill out a questionnaire.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
We listed the main factors.

04:48.000 --> 04:57.000
These are quality and functionality, design and passive, service support, deadlines, how the salon works.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
These are the main factors.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
The second indicator that the company uses to monitor this goal is the number of clients' ads.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
If we go down to the business processes, there is a goal of increasing the speed of order execution.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The indicator is quite clear here.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
The average deadline for order execution.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Here they have another indicator, which is not indicated here.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
This is the number of orders made on time.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
We promised clients such deadlines.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
There is some number that we managed to meet the agreed deadlines.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
There is some number of orders that we could not meet the agreed deadlines.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
Another goal of the business processes is the introduction of design and technological innovations.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
The number of these innovations that were implemented.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
The expansion of the network of salons is monitored through two indicators.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
This is a deviation from the schedule of opening of salons and the budget.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
The main indicator is the increase in the staff qualification.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
This is the percentage of jobs filled out by competent staff.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
And the last goal is to increase the satisfaction of the staff.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
There are two indicators, which are also quite clear.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
The index of satisfaction as a pre- and the current as a late.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
In this slide you can see that the company connects the system of goals and indicators of the business level in general with the organization.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
The organization is composed of four divisions.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
This is the division, which is headed by the financial director of FED.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
This is the division, which is headed by the director of production.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
He is in charge of all production, all logistics, design, as well as the service center.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
The marketing director in this company is in charge of marketing and sales, which are carried out in the salons.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
And finally, there is a HR manager in the company.

06:49.000 --> 07:06.000
The crosses in this matrix indicate that this structural division bears a certain responsibility for the good or bad value of a given indicator.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
Two crosses indicate that the responsibility for the good or bad is greater than that of the others.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
For example, the value of the business's own capital.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
To some extent, everyone is responsible for the size of their own capital.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Everyone contributes to the increase of the value of their own capital.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
But it has been decided that the role of the financial director is slightly greater than that of the others.

07:34.000 --> 07:44.000
The average term of the order is decided by the division, which is headed by the financial director,

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
by the division, which is headed by the production director, and by the division, which is headed by the marketing director.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
The fault or merit of the production managers is usually greater than that of the others.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
Therefore, we put two crosses in the column DP, the production director.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
The flow of personnel is undesirable, which can be a problem for the company.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
This also applies to absolutely all managers of the second level.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
But it has been decided that the main fault or merit is usually the fault or merit of the HR.

08:21.000 --> 08:31.000
This matrix is a good basis for making clear and understandable maps of structural divisions.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
A small example of the responsibility for the value of the indicator is the undesirable flow of personnel.

08:38.000 --> 08:50.000
Imagine that the financial director of a company receives information from the manager on the personnel via email.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Here is the content.

08:52.000 --> 09:04.000
The manager, digging on the Internet, found a resume of an employee who works in an accounting firm subordinate to the financial director.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
She is secretly looking for a job from the employer.

09:06.000 --> 09:16.000
The task of the HR is to periodically look on the Internet and see if the employees are looking for a job in secret from the employer.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
So, the resume of one employee was found on one of the sites, and she is looking for a job.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
HR informs the financial director that her subordinate is trying to find a job in secret from the employer.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
The financial director calls her subordinate and asks her,

09:35.000 --> 09:42.000
Masha, we found your resume on the Internet, you are looking for a job in secret from us.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
What happened? What is wrong? What are the problems?

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Masha asks, are you satisfied with my work?

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
The financial director says, yes, Masha, we are very satisfied with your work, you are a great fellow.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
You are doing great in your journal No. 7, which we entrusted you with.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
We have big plans and visions for you, you are our personnel reserve.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
We hope that you will develop very well in our company.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Masha asks, please tell me about the level of salary that you offer me.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
How much does it compensate my efforts?

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
The financial director says, I am sorry, Masha, I don't know how much your experts earn in the market.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
If this amount is not enough for you, why didn't you come and tell me that you are not enough,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I think I should earn more, I would gladly raise your salary.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
You should have told me about it. I think that if people don't ask, they are satisfied.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Masha says, my parents raised me differently.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
They told me that I shouldn't ask, I should work well,

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
and employers should see it, appreciate it and add to it.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
But I shouldn't ask.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Masha says, it is easier for me to quit the company than to ask.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So, what did she do?

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
She already talked to other employers, they raised her salary urgently,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
they tried to raise it, but she left anyway.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
The general director is in a very bad mood, because the future financial director has left.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
He had high hopes for Masha, he thought that she would be the future financial director.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And here is the question.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Who should be executed in this situation?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
The financial director or HR?

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Whose fault is it that this employee left the company?

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
We can conclude that it was both of them.

11:37.000 --> 11:46.000
I think that HR's task is not only to sit on the Internet and look at the results.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Ideally, HR should have drawn a portrait of Masha for her direct manager and told the financial director,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Masha is specific, she won't ask.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
And the second thing is the level of salary in the market for such specialists.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It is up to you to decide.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
It is your budget, if you think that you should raise the salary, do it.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
If you think that it is unnecessary, don't do it.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
I told you in time that the portrait is like this, the salary is like this.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
If HR did all this, there would be no claims to it.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But in this situation, there are obvious questions for both.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
And for the direct manager, who must do his job,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
he must provide his resources, including the budget, to HR,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
which helps the functional managers to do it.

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
In the next slide, I want to show you an example of the system of goals and indicators of a factory

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
that is part of a large machine-building enterprise.

12:48.000 --> 13:01.000
The head of the factory has 12 key indicators in front of him.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
One of the financial indicators is the indicator of the profitability of sales.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
A few words about the specifics of the work of this factory.

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
Almost all the products produced at this factory are consumed by the holding company.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
And the prices are internal, prescribed by the headquarters.

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
The factory director is told that the products produced at the factory are sold to the holding company at a certain price.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
If your costs are lower, you earn a profit.

13:37.000 --> 13:45.000
If your costs are higher than the prices we brought from the headquarters, you earn a loss.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Some amount of products is sold to external clients outside the company.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
A small amount.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
The planned profitability of sales, the share of the internal profit, was 10%.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
In fact, it turned out to be 8%.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
In fact, they were able to make only 8%.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
The costs at this factory were slightly higher than planned.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
The prices are fixed, they remained the same as planned.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
But the costs were obviously higher, so the profitability of sales was actually lower.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
In the projection of the client, there are three indicators.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
This is the number of advertisements for 100 deliveries,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
the number of new clients who were able to attract,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
and the number of contracts.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
In fact, the number of clients who left, who stopped working at this factory.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
In the project, there are five key indicators.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
This is the average delivery time to the client in a day.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.000
The second indicator informs about the percentage of compliance with the client's delivery deadlines.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
According to the plan, we would like the factory to be 97% compliant with the deadlines.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
In fact, they managed to do it even at 99%.

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
The third indicator at this factory is how well the suppliers with whom this factory works

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
fulfill their obligations by deadlines.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
The fourth indicator is the share of the marriage.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
The fifth indicator is the productivity of production.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
This is the last indicator in this projection.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
In the project, the staff monitors three values.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
This is the disease, the injury, the injury-prone production.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
People can injure their hands or get sick with a cold in winter.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
These are undesirable phenomena.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.000
Ideally, no more than 5% of the working time is lost due to the fact that people got sick or injured.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
The liquidity of the staff and the satisfaction are two indicators that add to the disease.

16:01.000 --> 16:10.000
The arrows in the second column inform us about the indicator for increase or decrease.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
The more, the better.

16:12.000 --> 16:19.000
This is the profitability of sales, the number of new clients, or the compliance of the client's delivery deadlines.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
The less, the better.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
This is the number of advertisements for 100 deliveries, the liquidity of the staff, the share of marriages.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
In the third column, the planned values are recorded for a certain period.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Next, we see the fact.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Next, we see the fact, the actual value.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And the third column is very interesting.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
They use such a value as the degree of the goal.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
How close are we to the goal?

16:50.000 --> 17:00.000
As if 12 carrots were hung high above us, and we have to reach each of them.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
How high did we jump?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Did we reach it?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
This is what the third column reports.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
The degree of the goal.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
The profitability of sales is 10%.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
In fact, we managed to achieve 8%.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
8% profitability of sales.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
The degree of the goal is 80%.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Next, the number of advertisements for 100 deliveries.

17:28.000 --> 17:36.000
We were told, or we wrote such a goal ourselves, or we agreed with the superiors to this value.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
No more than 3 advertisements for 100 deliveries.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
No more than 3.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
But in fact, it turned out 4 pieces.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
4 times the clients sent advertisements.

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
Accordingly, the degree of the goal will be 67%, if we round off.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
67%.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
We can find in this list the quantities that were overrun.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
For example, the number of new clients.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
The agreed goal is 10 new clients within a period.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
In fact, the company managed to attract 12 new clients.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Overrun, 120% execution.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
The same is true for the compliance with the delivery deadlines.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
The target value is 97% of deliveries on time.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
In fact, we managed to do as much as 99%.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
We register 102% in the third column.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
The degree of the goal.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
The disease rate of the staff.

18:34.000 --> 18:42.000
We wanted no more than 5% of the total working time to be spent on a cold.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
On the sick.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
In fact, we got worse.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
8.5% of the total working time was lost due to the fact that people were sick.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Accordingly, in the third column we calculate the degree of the goal.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
It will be very small. 30%.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
The carrot was hanging high enough.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
We jumped, but not very high.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Not very high.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
According to this parameter.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
What's next?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Next, you can just add up.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
These 12 are divided by 12.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
To calculate the average value of the degree of the goal.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
On average, it turns out 81.3.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
If you just add up all the values, you get 12.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
To calculate the average value.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
You can do it a little differently.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
This is probably more interesting.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
You can take into account the weights.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
You can assume that not all indicators are equally significant.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Not all indicators are equally significant.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Not all indicators are equally heavy.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Some are lighter, some are heavier.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
For example, in this slide we see the version with weights.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
The most important indicators are the profitability of sales.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Its weight is 0.15.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
The number of advertisements for 100 deliveries from customers is also 0.15.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
The compliance of delivery dates to customers is also 0.15.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
The share of marriages is also included in this list.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
These are very significant indicators.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
All other indicators are important.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
They have some weight, but it is slightly less.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But the sum should be 1.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And then we weigh the SDC column.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
The degree of goal achievement.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
On the weight column.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
And add it up in the third column.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
The degree of goal achievement is slightly less.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
In the previous slide, it was 81.3.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Here it is 80.

20:42.000 --> 20:53.000
Looking at this slide, we see that the plant has 80% of the indicators that we set.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Or that were agreed with it at the stage of strategic planning.

20:57.000 --> 21:04.000
As a rule, we write the goals for the structural units according to the principle of a two-way road.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
According to the principle of bottom-up and top-down.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
It is very important that the employees of the structural units participate in the development of the goals that they will achieve.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
They are slightly different in this regard.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Most people feel bad if they are married without their consent.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
If the employee was invited to the stage of the development of the goals,

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
if he was listened to, at least his opinion was heard.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Even if he left with an opinion imposed on him from above.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
But at least he spoke up, at least he was heard.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
He will have a slightly different attitude to the goals that he must achieve.

21:42.000 --> 21:51.000
So, we see that the plant, headed by some person, achieved 80% of the goals that were set for him.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
There are only 12 parameters.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
We are trying to look at this plant from all sides.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
A convenient visualization format is not a table, but a graph.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
In particular, this plant uses such a web, which I would like to offer to your attention.

22:09.000 --> 22:16.000
All the same indicators, only not in a table, but in the form of a so-called petal diagram.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
Or as they call it, a web.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Ideally, this line should go through 100%.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Ideally, each indicator is made up to 100%.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Ideally, we jumped up and got every carrot that was hanging high enough.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
Somewhere we even jumped the carrot by two indicators.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Somewhere we did it at a high enough percentage, and somewhere we had failures.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
The deeper the curve bends inward, to zero, the worse.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
The more the head of the unit should be on guard.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
But we see that there were quite serious failures with the disease of the staff.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
Too much work time was lost due to the fact that people were sick or injured.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
We see that the marriage was not so good.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
The curve is quite far from 100%.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
According to the terms of delivery, the suppliers were not so good.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
But there were quantities where the plant worked well.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
This is just a tool for visualization.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
But since most people are visual, they want to look at some graphs, not at the table.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
For example, these.

23:26.000 --> 23:36.000
It is logical to assume that the system of goals and indicators of the structural unit should be tied to the system of labor payment.

23:37.000 --> 23:45.000
The work of this structural unit, this plant, as part of a large machine-building enterprise, we control by 12 key indicators.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
The report can be submitted in the form of a web, in the form of a table.

23:51.000 --> 23:59.000
In addition to the fact that we tie the system of goals and indicators to the system of reporting, we usually tie it to the system of labor payment.

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
The system of labor payment for the head of this plant is as follows.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
He has some fixed amount and a bonus.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
Let's assume that the planned value of the bonus is 1000 conditional cash marks.

24:16.000 --> 24:24.000
This 1000 conditional cash marks will be paid to him if all indicators are met 100%.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
If the SDC, the degree of achievement of the goal, is 100%.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
If there is a re-performance, then more will be paid.

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
Let's assume that there was no re-performance, but there was a 100% execution of each indicator.

24:37.000 --> 24:45.000
Accordingly, the planned value turns into a fact, and the bonus will be 1000.

24:45.000 --> 24:55.000
But if, as in this example, we see that the degree of achievement of all goals is not 100%, but 80%,

24:55.000 --> 25:05.000
then the bonus that is paid to him in addition to the fixed fee will be equal to 803 euros.

25:05.000 --> 25:21.000
So, we see on this slide that the value of the bonus added to the fixed fee is tied to the achievement of the goal values of 12 indicators,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
sorted by four projections with a balanced system of indicators.

25:26.000 --> 25:36.000
In any case, we should have indicators that inform how well the staff works in this department,

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
what is its qualification, what are its competencies.

25:39.000 --> 25:49.000
In any case, we should have indicators that inform us how fast and high-quality the processes are in this department.

25:49.000 --> 25:56.000
We should have a projection of clients that allows us to get feedback from external clients or internal clients.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
And finally, all structural units live in the budget.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Some structural units, in addition to the budget, have a planned value of income.

26:05.000 --> 26:16.000
Therefore, the compensation system should take into account the value of the indicators from all four projections.

26:17.000 --> 26:34.000
In order to successfully implement the strategy, it is necessary to spend time on transforming it into a goal and task understandable for individual employees and structural units,

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
provide indicators, set checkpoints and tie the labor payment system.

26:41.000 --> 26:57.000
One of the most controversial issues that can be discussed at the stage of the implementation of the strategy is the question of who in the company we explain the business strategy to.

26:57.000 --> 27:08.000
We explain this only to deputy managers of the second level, whether we should go down to the third level and whether we should reach the rank and file.

27:09.000 --> 27:19.000
It is clear that in a construction company, the foreman on the construction site cuts tasks for his subordinates every day.

27:19.000 --> 27:31.000
He tells the stone workers that today we lay the wall, the height at the end of the day should be such, we lay the bricks like this, and explains some special nuances.

27:32.000 --> 27:44.000
He tells other workers that today we dig a trench, we will dig from the fence to the lunch, the depth of the trench is such, the width is such, and so on.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
If all this is done, then the compensation at the end of the week will be as follows.

27:51.000 --> 28:00.000
The task cutting today somehow contributes to the achievement of strategic goals of the construction organization as a whole,

28:00.000 --> 28:13.000
but should we explain to the staff, to the public, how this will affect the achievement of corporate goals, and why we should do it this way, and not in another way.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
Why do we have to bypass the wall that we see in front of us, and why should we not jump over it?

28:19.000 --> 28:32.000
If we stay with the construction business, then I remember the logic of my one acquaintance, who is in charge of a construction company.

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
He says that he understands the importance of a business strategy. It is an important thing in a competitive market.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
Without a clear strategy, you cannot survive in a competitive market.

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
But if you go down to the second level, to the hierarchy, if you come to the chief engineer, he tells me, and talk to him about the strategy,

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
then the chief engineer will say that the strategy is a game that is sold in the child's world.

28:57.000 --> 29:05.000
He bought his son recently, and he does not know more about the strategy, and it is unlikely that he will guess that the strategy is useful for the business.

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
He is not able to clearly formulate the strategy of the construction organization, although he is the chief engineer, the second person in the company.

29:12.000 --> 29:21.000
Going down to level 3, we talk to the foreman. According to my acquaintance, the foreman does not know the word strategy at all.

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
The chief engineer knows, but thinks that it is a game, and the foreman does not know the word strategy at all.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
Finally, we go down to the fourth level in the hierarchy, where, according to the chief engineer, the irreplaceable work.

29:34.000 --> 29:47.000
This is how he calls them in his company. He does not consider it necessary to explain the strategy to them, because he has an extremely low educational and intellectual level in the company,

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
and they are extremely unloyal. Today they work for him, tomorrow they will move to another place, and then they will come back to him.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
The foreman's settings. They are given tasks to do today, to dig from the fence to lunch.

30:00.000 --> 30:10.000
It is clear that the achievement of these tasks contributes to the fact that the company has some goals in the client or financial sector.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
The general manager does not collect the strategy of the staff of the private sector in this company.

30:16.000 --> 30:32.000
It seems to me that people are different. There are people in the company who work better if they understand why we bypass the wall on the left, and not on the right, and why we do not jump over it.

30:32.000 --> 30:48.000
It seems to me that there are a number of such people in any organization. There are a number of other people who work well, very well, if they were told that they dig from the fence to lunch.

30:48.000 --> 30:58.000
Why exactly from the fence and why exactly before lunch, why is the trench so and not so, and how it correlates with the achievement of the goal in the client sector, they do not know.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
But at the same time, they work very well and do not want to bother themselves with the reflection on why we do it.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
If the management of the company begins to explain this to them, they say, do not waste your time, both yours and ours.

31:10.000 --> 31:18.000
Tell them what we should do today or tomorrow, but do not explain to us why it is so and why it is not otherwise, and how it is related to higher goals.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
We will do everything well. But I think that such people should not be explained.

31:22.000 --> 31:46.000
I had a discussion with my friend who works in a telecommunications company. We argued whether the company's strategy could affect the list of the goals and indicators of an ordinary employee.

31:46.000 --> 31:58.000
For example, a driver who drives a boss to a meeting, takes him to the airport, meets the boss at the airport, sometimes throws the accounting into the bank.

31:58.000 --> 32:12.000
It would seem that everything is the same, first, second, third, fourth gear, do not drive through pits so that the car does not often break, do not violate the rules of traffic, and so on.

32:12.000 --> 32:26.000
I worked in a business school with a certain strategy, or in a telecommunications company with a certain strategy. Its actions are basically the same. And the map of the person's goals and indicators should coincide.

32:26.000 --> 32:40.000
But after discussing, we decided that it does not coincide completely. In the business school, in this industry, there can be a strategy, there should be a strategy.

32:40.000 --> 32:58.000
In this industry, the business school can differ from other organizations in that it offers Western diplomas on the market. One of the competitive advantages. We offer a diploma program of serious Western business schools.

32:58.000 --> 33:13.000
In this business school, there are always some foreigners, Swedes, Germans, French, Americans, and periodically you have to go to the airport to meet another foreign guest.

33:13.000 --> 33:30.000
No one requires a perfect English from the driver in this company. But to ask, how was your flight, he is in condition. The driver in this organization is told that he must know English.

33:30.000 --> 33:51.000
At least at a simple level, because the strategy of our business school involves internationalization. We work with Western programs, Western diplomas, we have a lot of foreigners, you need to build relations with them, support these relations.

33:51.000 --> 34:09.000
You also participate in this, periodically you meet them at the airport and take them there. You don't have to just look at the road, support the conversation, ask how are you, how was the flight, and so on. You need to know English. This is a small strategic feature of your work in our business.

34:09.000 --> 34:28.000
Everything else is the same. First, second, third gear, do not drive through pits, do not violate the traffic rules. If a person is fired from this company and goes to work in another, even in the telecommunications industry, he will also be told there, first, second, third, fourth gear, do not drive through pits, do not violate the traffic rules.

34:28.000 --> 34:45.000
But, I will add, in our business, it is very difficult to distinguish yourself from your competitors. The telecommunications industry is quite difficult in terms of making distinctions from each other. The only way to distinguish yourself is by the brand colors and logos.

34:45.000 --> 35:05.000
In one organization in this industry there are red and white colors, in another there are yellow and red, and in the third there are blue and green. And in one organization in this industry there is a small fleet of corporate cars that are painted in corporate colors. But it's not good for the company's face to drive around the city dirty.

35:05.000 --> 35:29.000
And in the map of the driver in this company, it is written to wash the car five times a day. Not every day, but if the weather on the street is bad, then he has to wash the car six and seven times a day. This is an element of a marketing strategy. Popularization of corporate colors, corporate color propaganda is one of the important factors of competitive struggle in this business.

35:29.000 --> 35:53.000
And the driver is told, here is a small specificity of your strategic work in our business, that you have to wash the car more often. You may not know English, in another company, with a different strategic specificity, you must know English, but in our business you can be without a language at all. But you have to wash the car often. And this is your small strategic specificity.

35:53.000 --> 36:18.000
And to finish my speech, I would like to quote one American manager, who says that you may have a fantastic strategy, but if it is not translated into understandable for individual employees, let it be for ordinary people who fill the fuel tank on the gas station,

36:18.000 --> 36:35.000
and this process is not controlled, then all your wonderful plans may simply end up in the box of the desk and not be implemented in practice.

36:35.000 --> 37:01.000
The conclusion, the most important one from our course, is that the strategy in the company is the business of everyone. The fundamental concept of the development of the organization must be broken down into a package of actions understandable for individual employees, provided with indicators and designated by certain points of control, tied to the reporting system and necessarily with the stimulation system.

37:05.000 --> 37:28.000
The main conclusion of this course is the following. The strategy of the company, as a rule, is a short-formulated one, it must be translated into a package of actions understandable for individual employees.

37:28.000 --> 37:49.000
Very often in companies you can face the following problem. An employee comes from the sales department to the manager and says, boss, I read on the company's internal website, our internal website, our strategy is briefly formulated, it excites me very much, I am two-handed for it.

37:49.000 --> 38:05.000
I will do everything I can to achieve these goals, but please explain to me what I should and should not do at my workplace in order to help my beloved company achieve its goals.

38:05.000 --> 38:32.000
I would like to say that this short-formulated strategic concept, we have to break it down into pieces, into component elements, into the actions of the project, set them as tasks for the structural units, provide indicators so that it can be measured, deadlines and surnames, and tie them to the reporting system and necessarily with the stimulation system of the staff.

38:32.000 --> 38:53.000
I would also like to say that this tool that we have considered has been tested in companies of various industries in the last few years, both in production, in trade and in the service sector. It was tested in companies of various sizes, in large corporations, in small hairdressers.

38:53.000 --> 39:18.000
In addition, it was tested in classic businesses focused on making profits and in so-called non-profit organizations that do not seek to maximize profits. At one of the conferences in Germany, I managed to listen to the head of the police department from the city of Offenburg.

39:18.000 --> 39:39.000
In Germany, there is a small city called Offenburg, there is a police department, a police station. The employees who read the book Guru on this topic decided to make a strategic map and a balanced system of indicators for their small organization.

39:39.000 --> 39:58.000
There is a specificity, because they cannot declare profit, capitalization, cost, revenue, purely a flow of money as the final goals they strive for. They have the same four projections, finance, clients, processes and staff, but tied in a slightly different way.

39:58.000 --> 40:21.000
Finance is a budget that they must fit into. As clients, this structure understands the residents of the city in which they exist. There is no competition in this city. There is one police department that cannot work in other cities, and police officers from other cities do not come to this city.

40:21.000 --> 40:42.000
They want to position themselves as an organization that provides security, a quiet sleep for the residents of the city. They themselves periodically question the residents of the city, conduct inquiries about what is good and bad in the work of the police, what they like and do not like, what they could do better.

40:43.000 --> 41:03.000
And inspections from the regional center of Stuttgart come, which also question the residents of the city about what they like and do not like in the work of the police. There are business processes, standard values, the disclosure of crimes, the average arrival time of the car at the scene, there are some decisions on the staff.

41:04.000 --> 41:24.000
This tool is used not only in classical businesses focused on making a profit, but also in the non-profit sector. Non-profit organizations and non-commercial structures also benefit from the use of this tool,
