00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, dear colleagues!

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
My practical experience allows me to share with you some of the techniques that have been developed over this time.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
Today we will discuss the topic of the promotion of goods, the promotion of new goods to the market or existing goods.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
The demand for advertising from the owners of companies is growing every year.

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
Promotion of goods to the market, support of loyalty of customers and, as a result, increase of profitability of the company

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
become the main goal and the main guarantee of the success of the company on the market.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
Only a competent setting of goals, as well as clear planning, allows to achieve successful results.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
Today we will discuss the various promotion tools that will allow you to achieve success and stand on the high competitive market.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
There are several main tools that we will discuss.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
The first is advertising.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
We will look at the existing advertising tools, which of them are more effective, less effective

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
and what are the trends of development in the advertising market today.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
The next tool that we will consider is, of course, PR.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
PR helps companies to better present themselves on the market, position themselves,

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
and also look more positive in the eyes of the public,

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
thus maintaining loyal customers and optimizing costs for advertising and marketing.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
The next tool is sales promotion.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
Sales promotion is the most effective tool for short-term goals, for increasing the company's turnover.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
We will also consider several practical methods that will allow you to achieve such results.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
The next tools are direct marketing and personal sales,

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
which are also quite effective if you act according to the given algorithm.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
In conclusion, we will look at how to calculate the effectiveness of certain events.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
This is perhaps the key point and key issue for marketers and advertisers in companies.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Marketing communication is divided into at least two parts today.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
You can see it on the slide.

02:37.000 --> 02:50.000
This is ATL or above the line, and below the line.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
There is a legend that one of the managers of one of the large companies,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
they say it was in Procter & Gamble, decided to calculate the costs for marketing.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
He calculated the costs for exhibitions, advertising, media,

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
additional events that need to be held to support sales.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
He drew a line, but remembered that he forgot a few more things.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
This is the promotion of sales, this is the holiday of the city.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
Thus, having calculated the final cost, he received all the costs for marketing.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Since then, all costs for marketing are divided into two parts.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
You can see this division on the slide.

03:36.000 --> 03:45.000
Although today this line is erased, and today there is no clear division.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
Nevertheless, in the field of marketing, in the theory of marketing, it got its continuation.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Everything above the line is considered a general advertising,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
and it includes advertising in the media, advertising on television,

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
advertising on the Internet, and transport advertising.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Everything below the line is related to the promotion of sales,

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
promotion in trade channels, promotion of the end consumer,

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
exhibitions, sponsorship, all this is related to BTL.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
Thus, in this division, we will consider these tools.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
First of all, let's talk about market trends, advertising costs.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
On the slides, you can see what trend of advertising costs exists today,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
and even the forecast of market experts, what will happen in the future.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
We see that a large part is taken by advertising on television.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Despite the fact that it becomes less and less effective,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
since the information flows are very large,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and many people simply do not perceive this advertising,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
often switch channels, which we often do.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Nevertheless, advertising on television, its costs, its turnover will grow.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
And they will grow due to the fact that new goods will be promoted,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
the market will be more competitive,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
and more and more television channels will appear.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Naturally, due to this, the turnover of advertising will grow.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Advertising is approximately stagnant in mass media,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
in other, printed, industry publications.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Nevertheless, the turnover with the growth of the market will increase in the same way,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
the share will remain approximately the same.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
And if we look at the costs of external advertising,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
we see that the share of external advertising is decreasing,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
and will decrease, because the streets of our cities

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
are already practically overflowing with external advertising.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
There is a tendency to reduce such advertising.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Let's also pay attention to the trend of the development of the BTL market.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
The BTL market is growing, and in three years,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
looking at the table, you will see that in three years it has grown by two times.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
This is a very serious trend.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
It comes to us from the Western market.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
In the West, about half of the costs are general advertising,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
and about half are costs for BTL.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
In our Russian market, the trend is different.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
To date, only 5-10, a maximum of 15% of the most advanced companies

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
spend on BTL.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Nevertheless, as you can see, they are growing dynamically.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Why is this happening?

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
This happens for several reasons, and we will discuss them now.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
The first reason is a large number of branded goods with the same properties.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
We come to the store and see a lot of products under different brands,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
but they are practically impossible to distinguish by properties.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
They differ in price, they differ in name, but have the same characteristics.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
As a result, we have a hard time choosing what to buy.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
BTL helps us choose a product, because there are auctions,

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
because we are reminded of a particular product, and we pay attention to it again.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
BTL gives immediate results in sales.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
The next reason is the lack of an original image idea for advertising.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Yes, creativity is great, and it is wonderful to come up with a new idea.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Many companies are now making a breakthrough in this market,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
but as we can see, competition is getting tougher.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
It is very easy to repeat this idea, and competitors do it.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
By repeating the idea, creativity and exclusivity are lost.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
And we merge again in a single stream with all the other products.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Therefore, to maintain creativity, you need a lot of costs.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Various agencies, different views on a particular product.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
That is why we are again inclined to BTL advertising,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
which allows you to achieve immediate results.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
The next reason is the lack of trust in Russian managers

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
who play the leading role of the trademark.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Yes, there are Coca-Cola managers, there are Pepsi-Cola managers,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
who have been developing their image for years,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
and now they cost billions of dollars.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Of course, not every manager believes that his brand

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
can be just as famous and profitable.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
Although the tendency to think that the cost of non-material assets

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
is increasing, some companies are starting to do this,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
but this is only a small step.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Unfortunately, many managers do not go for this,

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
considering the costs of image advertising as just a waste of money.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
After all, costs for image must be made constantly.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Single-time investments will not help to preserve the image of companies.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
Many brands are forgotten only because they stopped spending money on them.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Naturally, not every owner is ready to constantly invest in such resources.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
The next reason for the increase in costs for BTL

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
is the desire to pay for costs in the short term.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
BTL shares allow you to get immediate results,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
as we have already said, and pay for your costs immediately.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Naturally, costs for image will not be paid immediately,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
because this is a long-term strategy of the company.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Not every owner, not every company manager

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
is ready to invest their money for a long time.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Why? Because today the economy is unstable.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
It has become much more stable than it was five years ago,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
but, compared to the Western market,

09:39.000 --> 09:48.000
we are still at the stage of waiting for some crisis,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
some legislative changes,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
which does not allow owners and companies

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
to hope for a long-term return of their invested money,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
their invested financial resources.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
The next reason is speculation about the desire of the buyer to receive bonuses.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
This is psychology. We all love gifts.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
We are pleased to receive them, as it is pleasant to give.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
Therefore, any programs to stimulate sales

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
have such a good result, such a success,

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
because all customers, including you and me, buy gifts.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
The next point is to eliminate the seasonal factor

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
when selling products.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Any product is seasonal.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Some products are sold for half a year,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
and some are not sold for half a year.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Take, for example, mosquito cream.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
We can buy it in spring, in summer,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
but we do not need it in winter or in autumn.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
And any other products are also subject to the influence of seasonality.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
The programs to stimulate sales allow us to do a lot.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
The first is to increase sales in the low season

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
in order to stabilize the situation in the company,

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
and in the high season to take away an additional share of the market from the competitor

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
or at least keep your share.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The programs to stimulate sales also help.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
The next reason is to establish a close relationship with the consumer,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
or, as they call it in the West, personalization.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
This trend is also going to us from the West,

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
and there, today, the fashion for personalization has captured all the minds of business.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
It is still going to us,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
but it is a trend of the future,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
when we will have to go out to almost every consumer individually

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
and meet their requirements.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Naturally, we are allocating segments today

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
and trying to adjust our proposals to the requirements of a certain group of consumers,

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
but in the future we will be getting closer and closer to the individual requests of our clients.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
Let's look at the place of integrated marketing communications

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
or promotion tools in the general planning structure.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Here is a slide of the structure of the marketing plan,

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
a standard document that determines the company's activities for the entire next year.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
And despite the fact that this document is called a marketing plan,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
it determines the activities of the entire company,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
because all the structures involved in it,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
who it can be,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
this is, of course, the sales department and the marketing department,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
this is, of course, the procurement department,

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
because they buy products at the requirements that the consumer or market presents to us.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
This is, of course, the quality department, which monitors the quality of our products.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
This is the production department, if we have it,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
this is the department that produces our products.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
The next department is the personnel department.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Why does it participate in the marketing plan?

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
Because it provides qualified personnel for achieving the set goals.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
And, in fact, this is how we can say about any department that works in the company.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I probably forgot about the finance department,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
it is also key in the implementation of the marketing plan,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
because it provides financing for the developed document.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
Well, the marketing plan is a fairly standard document,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
and it is divided into two parts.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
The first part is the analysis that marketers do in order to understand where we should go.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
And the second part is, of course, the development of the very strategies

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
on the basis of which the company will operate.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
The first of them is the assortment strategy,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
when we determine the assortment,

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
by which we will position and promote ourselves in the market.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
The second strategy is the price one,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
when we determine at what price, with what discounts or prices,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
we will offer our products on the market.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
The third strategy is distribution.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
Here we consider which channels of sales we will sell our goods and offer it on the market.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
And the fourth is just the communication strategy or promotion strategy,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
in fact, how we will present ourselves,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
how we will talk to our customers about ourselves

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
and what events we will do in order to implement our plan.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
What is included in the communication policy?

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Four main tools of promotion are included in the communication policy.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
The first is, of course, advertising, and we will talk about it separately.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
The second point is the promotion of sales,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
these are all events that relate to BTL.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
The third point is, of course, PR, and it is highlighted by a separate tool,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
because it is really a separate tool of the company,

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
which allows you to optimize resources and support,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
one way or another, to have companies on the market.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
And the fourth section, the fourth tool of marketing communications,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
is, of course, personal sales.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Personal sales also relate to marketing communications,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
because, in fact, in the process of sales,

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
communication with a specific consumer is carried out.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Let's consider what communication policy is.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Communication policy is the whole set of means

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
that unites the interaction with all objects of our communications.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
The objects are presented on the slide,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
and we will talk about each of them separately now.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
The first object is, of course, the employees of the company or the personnel of the company.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Very often we forget about this and do not work with our personnel,

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
but, in fact, the whole communication with our clients begins with them.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And you need to work especially carefully with the personnel.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Try to ask your sales managers a question,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
what is best for sale?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Well, there will be one of the following answers.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
The first is what I know, the second is what I like personally,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and the third is what is known.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
The products are always sold well, and you need to make the least effort.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
That is why our task is to convey to the personnel of the company

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
the attractiveness of the product that we promote and sell.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
I will give an example from my experience.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
When I worked in one of the companies on the alcohol market,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
in addition to the alcohol sector, we also had a tobacco sector.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
And in the canteen of the company cigars were sold,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
which the company itself offered for sale on the market.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
But they did not do very well on the market,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
they were not used by the active demand.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
And we set ourselves the goal of finding out what was going on,

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
why they were not so popular,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
and tried to start, of course, with the personnel of the company.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
We simply organized a tasting of these cigars during a lunch break,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
when we invited all the employees of the company,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
who naturally smoke, to try to taste these cigars

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
and fill out the forms that were previously developed.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
We killed two birds with one stone.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
The first of them was, of course, a survey,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
in fact, a market survey,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
given that there are quite a lot of employees in the company,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
about 2,500 people,

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
and they represent completely different categories of people,

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
starting with loaders and ending with top managers of the company.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Naturally, we managed to survey all categories of potential clients.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
This is the first point.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
And the second point, naturally, was to make such an internal PR,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
because people, having tried this product,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
first began to buy it from wall companies,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
and secondly, to recommend it to their colleagues, friends, acquaintances,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
because they themselves knew that it was attractive,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
it was interesting, and they liked it.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
And such points are very important for the company,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
because the more correctly we tell about the product,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
the more correctly we position it within the company,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
the more it will be sold on the market.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
This is the very first step that needs to be taken.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
The second point, or the second object of our communications,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
is, of course, consumers.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, what can I say about this?

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
The main communications are aimed at our consumers,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
because it depends on them whether our company will work successfully on the market,

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
whether our product will be in demand and loyalty,

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
whether clients will come again and again for what we offer on the market.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
We will talk about this separately.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
The next object is marketing intermediaries,

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
or, to be more precise, our dealers, distributors,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
wholesalers, retail networks.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
This is a trading channel,

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
this is the channel that helps to deliver our product to the end consumer.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
And here, active events of trade marketing are used.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
This is a very important point,

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
because without this, today, you will simply not be competitive on the market.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
We will consider several interesting discount programs,

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
which can be used for the trade marketing channel.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
The next point is our suppliers.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Naturally, suppliers are very important for the company,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
because if relations suddenly deteriorate,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
or something happens to our suppliers,

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
we no longer have the products that we have conceived and that we offer on the market.

19:35.000 --> 19:42.000
It is imperative to maintain a very loyal and good relationship with suppliers.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
After all, not only the quality of your product depends on this,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
but also discounts for you, cost-effectiveness.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
The more loyal your relationship with suppliers,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
the more likely it is that the cost-effectiveness of your product will be lower and lower.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
The next object is competitors.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
It is strange to talk about competitors in communication policy,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
but nevertheless, let's say.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
With competitors, you need to follow the rules of the game.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
You need to have a civilized competition.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And we are gradually approaching this,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
although not all competitors behave civilizedly on the market.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
Nevertheless, my favorite saying is about competitors as about dead.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Either good or nothing.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Here is the compliance with the rules of the game.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Another object is contact audiences,

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
or those who recommend our product to the market,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
but may not sell it themselves.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
These may be agents of influence,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
these may be people sitting on the streams of information,

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
these may be famous people who drive your cars,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
dress in your clothes,

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
and thus promote one or another way of life.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
With them, of course, you also need to maintain a constant relationship.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
Here are also the media that you invite to your conferences,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
briefings, events,

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
and they cover the life of your company in their sources,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
provide information to the buyer.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
Let's take a look at all the instruments that have already been listed.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
The first tool is advertising.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
What is it?

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, this is not a personal message through the media,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
television, radio.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Any source of printed information,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
industry advertising,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
or general glossy magazines,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
which we sometimes buy.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Advertising, of course, has its pros and cons.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
The first plus is a wide coverage.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Imagine you ordered, made a video on TV,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
showed it in good time,

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
and now you have a coverage of several million people in our country.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Very tempting and very interesting.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Moreover, advertising is repeated,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
and this is also a big plus.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Why?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
There is such a law in psychology.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
If you have seen or heard one or another ad seven times,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
even if it made a negative impression on you,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
it doesn't matter,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
this information is already recorded in your subconscious.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
When you come to the store,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
your subconscious works for you.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
It chooses those moments, those brands,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
which were already known to you.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I'll give you an example.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
You probably all watched the cartoon Troisprostokvashino.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
A rather popular cartoon.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
So, in this cartoon there is such a plot.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
When Uncle Fyodor and his father brought a cat home,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Mom saw this cat and said to Dad,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
choose, either a cat or me.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
What did Dad answer?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Maybe you remember?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Dad replied literally,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
of course, I choose you.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I've known you for a long time,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
and this is the first time I see this cat.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
That's how we act in the store as buyers, as consumers.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Our subconscious chooses what we have already seen or known.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Therefore, of course, from the point of view of promotion,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
from the point of view of advertising,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
it's great if your product is well-known.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
If not, advertising will help with this.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Repetitiveness allows you to ensure

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
the recognition of your product on the shelf among other products.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
But, of course, advertising has its downsides.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
First, inadaptability in the contact process.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
What is it?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Your video came out, you see something is wrong,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
but you can't change anything anymore,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
the ad has already come out.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Or you printed something in the publication,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
you didn't like the result,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
but you can't change anything.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
That's it, your work on this is over.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
You can only take part in one or another mistake next time.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
And the costs are quite high,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
because advertising is usually expensive.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
The next point is low informativeness.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
You can't give a lot of information in advertising,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
because it will be overloaded,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and people will simply not perceive it.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
Therefore, it is very difficult to give information about a new product in an advertising video.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Information articles help,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
but this is already a mixture of advertising and PR.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Okay, let's move on.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
The next tool is the stimulus of sales.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
A very good tool, very interesting,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
as we have already discussed today,

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
gives immediate results.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Let's look at the first definition.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
These are short-term methods of sales stimulation.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
Accordingly, the tool is aimed directly at increasing the sales of the company.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
What are the advantages of this tool?

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
The first is, of course, high efficiency.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Because, as we said today,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
everyone loves gifts, discounts, bonuses, and so on.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
And this is exactly what the stimulus of sales works on.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
Almost most customers are affected

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
and react well to various programs.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
The second point.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
When stimulating sales, we can convey a very large amount of information.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Why?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
For example, promoters work.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
If they are instructed well,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
they can convey a lot of information,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
tell about the product,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
show its advantages, applicability, and so on.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
And, of course, the probability of buying increases in this case.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
And, of course, another plus is high adaptability.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
We can change something in the process of contact with you.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Well, if not us, then the promoters.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
That is, they adapt to the desire of the buyer.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
This also plays a big role and has a good impact on sales.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
But, of course, there are also disadvantages to stimulating sales.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
The first is, of course, high cost.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
We spend a lot on the program for stimulating,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
because there is a very large list of costs.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Despite the fact that the effect comes at once,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
we also need to spend well.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
The next point is short-term.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
The program for stimulating sales has passed,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
the effect is over,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
and we need to think about further actions again

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
in order not to lag behind competitors.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
This, of course, is also a minus.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
That is, stimulating sales does not have a long-term effect.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
And the next point is relatively low coverage.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
We cannot, as in advertising,

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
make contacts with several million of our consumers at once.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
We choose trading points,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
we choose companies with which we carry out

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
certain programs for stimulating.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Therefore, coverage is limited here.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
There is also one minus that I would like to mention.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
Our buyers or our clients get used to stimulation.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Sometimes the effect is as follows.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Without stimulation, they do not want to buy a product.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
That is why we need to alternate,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
change the program for stimulation

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
in order not to cause habits.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
The next point or the next tool is personal sales.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
When we offer a product to a particular client

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
who will use this product.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
A wonderful communication tool.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
What are the advantages of this tool?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
The first is high adaptability.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
When we are together with the client,

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
we can understand his desires, hopes,

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
offer what he wants

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
and adjust the conversation in order to get the result.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
The next big advantage is the possibility of signing a deal.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
We immediately held negotiations

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
and we can immediately sign a contract or a contract

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
and make a deal.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And the next point is confidentiality.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
What is the advantage of being alone with a client?

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
You can offer him additional conditions

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
that no one will know about except you.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
There are also disadvantages.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
The first is a small coverage.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
If you have 2 or 5 thousand clients,

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
you simply will not be able to personally talk to everyone.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
It will be unrealistic.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Therefore, of course, a small coverage.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
You can only sell directly to key clients.

28:17.000 --> 28:24.000
Or only if the number of your clients is strictly limited.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
The next point is organizational difficulties.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Each client needs to get there,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
make his own contract,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
adjust to individual conditions.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
This creates additional difficulties, of course,

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
but nevertheless, personal sales remain an effective tool

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
for promotion and sales of products.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
And one more very important point

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
is the need for professionals.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
If you send a person who is not a professional

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
to an important negotiation,

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
your negotiations may fail.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And often personal sales,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
when we hold personal sales,

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
large sums are at stake.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
And it is better not to allow non-professionals

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
to make a deal.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
The next tool we will talk about

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
is PR or public communication.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It is a very interesting tool.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And its main feature is that

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
it is not aimed at increasing sales directly.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
This is the only tool, perhaps,

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
from which you cannot demand an increase in sales tomorrow.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
This is a work on the image of the company.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
This is a work on the impact,

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
on the feelings, thoughts of our clients,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
on increasing loyalty.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
We hold PR-sessions

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
and thus maintain contact with our target audience.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
It is a very important tool,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
but we need to understand that

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
tomorrow, of course,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
our sales may not increase.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Although, of course,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
we must use this tool

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
to develop the image of companies on the market,

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
to maintain our competitiveness.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
I can give the following example as a comparison.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Imagine that you want to increase your image.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
You buy a very expensive suit and wear it.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
But this does not mean

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
that tomorrow you will earn a million dollars.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Of course, this will work on your image,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
but not immediately.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
This is how public communication or PR works.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And this tool has its pros and cons.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Let's look at them.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
The main advantages are, of course, a large coverage.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
These promotions can be held en masse,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
with the involvement of the media,

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
television, various print publications,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
which will cover your promotions.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
And this is a powerful emotional impact.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
This is the main advantage,

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
because it is emotions that are best remembered by a person.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
We let them through,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
they remain in our soul,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
they remain pleasant memories.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
It is these memories that then encourage

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
you to treat a particular company well,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
to buy a particular product.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
This is the main advantage of PR.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
What are the cons?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Cons are high cost,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
because PR promotions cannot be cheap.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
We usually invest a lot

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
to hold such promotions.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
The next point is, again, the need for professionals.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I recommend, as a specialist,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
not to do this on your own,

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
but to contact a specialized agency.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Because here you need sociologists, psychologists,

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
in order to hold this promotion properly,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
so that everything is clearly planned,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
and everything goes smoothly.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
And most importantly, to give your result,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
to be remembered by the end consumers.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And one more point.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
This is, of course, a complex technology,

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
which is why professionals will do everything better

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
than the company itself.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Today we have discussed the main tools

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
that are the tools of communication policy.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Throughout the course,

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
we will now go into more detail

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
in advertising, sales, PR, and personal sales.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
We will look at the main practical methods

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
and tools of this or that kind.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
Advertising

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
Well, let's first look at advertising.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Let's look at the main types of advertising

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
that various companies in the market use now.

32:46.000 --> 32:53.000
And these types of advertising are divided into three main groups.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
The first is general advertising,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
which refers to television, mass media,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
and information aimed at any audience.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
The second part is industry advertising,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
which refers to industry media,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
corporate publications, and so on.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
And the third group is new types of advertising

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
that somehow invade our lives,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
make changes, and help this industry develop.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Let's start with general advertising.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
What is general advertising?

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
What is effective and what is not very effective for work?

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
The first is, of course, television advertising.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
As we have already said today,

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
this is very effective advertising

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
because it is repeated and allows us to remember

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
and stay in the memory of our end consumers.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
But here you need to pay attention to the following point.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
If you advertise on television in the regions of the Russian Federation,

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
and our country is large,

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
we sell our goods in different cities.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
So if you promote your goods in another city,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
not the one you live in,

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
pay attention to the control system.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Because today there is a tendency to steal.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Stealing, of course, in quotation marks,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
but nevertheless they steal our time,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
which we have paid for advertising.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
They put their news there,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
and the general advertising,

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
for which time has been paid, does not come out.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
And your consumer just does not see it.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
Therefore, if you are engaged in such events,

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
please control, ensure control

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
of the release of your advertising

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
at the time when it was planned.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Advertising leaflets.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Well, actually, everyone is familiar with the tool.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
You are surrounded by leaflets from the city or from the transport.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
You are given them in your hands,

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
you are thrown into mailboxes.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Sometimes it irritates us.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Nevertheless, in relation to its cost,

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
advertising leaflets work very well.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
And about 3-5% of customers react to these leaflets.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
And this is a very good way out.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Therefore, if your product fits

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
such a specificity,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
where you can advertise yourself in this way,

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
and these are services, this is a product of popular consumption,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
it fits very well here, you can easily use it.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
The next point is advertising in the media.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Various ads, information advertising,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
advertising blocks or modules in general magazines.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Of course, they also work well,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
but it is especially great when you put on the ad

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
and it is supported by advertising in other sources,

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
for example, on television,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
or supported by promotion campaigns,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
when there is a complex impact.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Advertising in the media has its own peculiarity.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
If you give it only once, it will not be remembered.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
It will just be wasted money.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
At least you need to give such an ad at least three times.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Better, of course, more often.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
But it is important to keep it in your head,

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
in the thoughts, in the knowledge of your customers.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
The next source or next tool

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
is outdoor advertising.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
Outdoor advertising is also a good tool for promotion.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
In general, outdoor advertising

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
tells about the actions carried out,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
for example, in a particular store.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Sale, discount, receiving gifts.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
It works very well,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
because the place of sale and the idea of ​​the promotion are announced there.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Customers see it and go to a particular store.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
It is also great to carry out image support in outdoor advertising,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
when you somehow remind about yourself,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
about your brand, about your company.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
If you have other goals,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
for example, to bring a new product to the market,

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
then, in fact,

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
it is risky to give outdoor advertising.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Just risky.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
Because without knowing the product,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
it is unlikely that customers will associate your trademark

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
with your product and it is unlikely that they will remember it.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
This, of course, can be done within a general advertising campaign,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
integrated, which runs through all sources.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Then at least some kind of association and support

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
will be available to customers.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
If this is the only means you are using,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
then most likely the money will be spent in vain.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
The next type of advertising is advertising in transport.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
In buses, trolleys, trams,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
metro, minibuses, taxis,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
advertising is now appearing.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Yes, advertising in transport works well,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
because a person is forced to be in a closed space

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
while he is going to his stop.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
He looks at the walls, monitors,

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
everything that is there.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Of course, this works well.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
The only subtlety of advertising is to effectively give

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
the product or the point of sale

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
that is located along the movement of this transport line.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Otherwise, the buyer,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
when leaving the transport,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
will simply forget about your product,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
The next point is industry advertising.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Let's see what is related to industry advertising.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Of course, this is industry advertising

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
on specialized television.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
For example, cable television,

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
there are some special programs

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
that relate to your industry.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
For example, medical products,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
you can advertise in medical programs,

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
in specialized programs.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
It works very well,

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
because it reaches the target audience of your clients.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
The next interesting point

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
or interesting trend that is gaining momentum

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
is the development of corporate publications,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
corporate magazines, corporate newspapers.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
Many companies are now doing this.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Here are the main conditions.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
If you want to publish a publication,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
it should not exceed 999 copies,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
because if you make 1000,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
you will need to license and register,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
and this is additional funds and additional costs.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
Actually, 999 copies allows you

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
to develop and produce printed publications

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
such as magazines and newspapers

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
within the company,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
and the company supports this.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
The company provides internal PR,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
supports image,

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
and allows customers to get acquainted

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
with the release of new products,

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
with various programs,

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
with winners of certain competitions.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
It works very well.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
If you have such an opportunity or a desire,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
it is very convenient to advertise,

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
to tell about your company,

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
to remind about your existence,

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
to tell about the release of new products,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
how they solve certain problems of clients,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
to write about some problematic articles.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
This is a very good effect in corporate magazines,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
because the specialists who turn to them

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
are looking for answers to certain questions.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
The next point is to distribute all the information

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
that we have already listed

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
at the corporate exhibitions, fairs, conferences.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
This is very effective and profitable,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
because you do not spend additional funds

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
and thus you distribute information

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
about your company, again,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
specifically for the target audience.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
The next direction is new types of advertising,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
which allow advertising industries to develop,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
not stand still, to bring out all new interesting products,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
to attract the attention of end consumers,

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
because new types stand out among all the others.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
The first thing I would like to say

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
is multimedia.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
There is a very interesting trend now.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Many companies develop multimedia presentations,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
develop games in which the client

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
follows a certain path, constantly meeting products

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
along the way of the game.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
Either it is catalogs or presentations,

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
which are animated and very interesting for viewing.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
In each of us lives a child.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Maybe somewhere deep, but nevertheless.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
This helps to influence not only knowledge,

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
but also the consumer's feelings,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
because living in a certain environment,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
experiencing a certain game,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
a certain information, a person remembers

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
the information and product of your company very well.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
The next type of advertising,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
which is distributed in the Internet system

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
by various signs, geographically,

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
ethnically, professionally,

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
is various associations, various clubs,

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
which are now being created.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
You can promote your product in one way or another,

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
getting your audience in the same way.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
The next very interesting point is

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
the development of blogs in the Internet system.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
This is not only an advertising source,

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
but also an information source.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Many serious corporations have already actively

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
engaged in the blogosphere system.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
Blogs grow daily by several thousand additional

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
users. Naturally, in such a large field of information,

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
the first thing you can do is to analyze

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
how your product is perceived, whether your customers

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
like it or not, what they say about it.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
Moreover, there is no censorship,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
which is good for the developers,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
for the manufacturers of the product.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
They can see and hear the very first information

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
coming from the first mouth, as it is called.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
This is a very good way to promote the blogosphere.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
You can launch your information there,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
launch a discussion of a particular topic,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
which will remind about your brand

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
and promote your product.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
The next point is free boards in the Internet system.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
Advertising boards have existed for a long time,

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
but nevertheless work well.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
The advertising system for the sale or purchase

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
of a product in a particular region

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
helps us to see all the requests

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
in a particular place in a particular region

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
and, accordingly, to promote our product

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
with almost minimal costs.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Another new advertising option

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
is a running line.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
It may be not so new,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
but today we see big screens

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
with multimedia ads,

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
advertising videos and a running line,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
which allows us to provide information

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
about our product.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Another interesting trend is that

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
today in many cities,

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
according to the experience of Europe,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
special boards are being introduced

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
at public transport stops,

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
which is a new trend.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Nevertheless, even there is a running line

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
and you can provide information

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
about your nearest shopping center

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
or a possible promotion in a particular place.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
A customer can easily reach the shopping center

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
and participate in your promotion

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
or buy your product.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
This is also a new trend

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
in the advertising industry.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
The next thing I would like to show

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
is a method of choosing an advertiser.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
There are many of them,

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
but how to choose the most effective one?

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
I want to suggest you to consider

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
the method of choosing an advertiser,

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
what to focus on,

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
what to stop,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
and how to choose an advertiser.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
I want to show you this method

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
using the example of the elite alcohol market.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
We chose advertisers for the end user,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
not for the specialists in this market,

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
but for the end user.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
We had three options.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
The first one is the industry magazines.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
There are many industry magazines,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
such as the Wine Club,

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
which can be read by the customers

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
in the specialized shops.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
There is also a TV channel

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
where we can advertise our product.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
However, there is a special feature.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
According to the law,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
you cannot advertise alcohol products

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
on TV screens.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
If we decide to do this,

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
we will have to look for some other options.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
The third option is the media,

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
such as newspapers.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
It is not interesting to advertise alcohol products

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
in the newspapers,

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
but there you need your own approach.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
You need to find interesting stories,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
historical events, facts

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
and the way of life of the consumer.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
We chose these three options

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
and we had to decide

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
where we will present ourselves,

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
where it is more profitable,

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
where it is more interesting and where it is better.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
We chose the following criteria for the assessment.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
The first criterion is the volume of the publication.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
How many customers can apply to this media?

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
If you look at the table,

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
you will see that the largest audience

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
is television, newspapers and the press.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
The next criterion is the volume of the appeal.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
This is the volume that shows

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
how many of the end consumers

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
will watch this newspaper.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
Here you can see that newspapers and newspapers

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
account for a little more than television.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
The next criterion is the audience of the carrier.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Here we look at the main audience.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
We see that in specialized magazines

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
the main audience is the elite alcohol market specialists.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
If we take television or newspapers,

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
there are, of course, end consumers.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Our goal in this assessment is, of course,

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
end consumers.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
The next criterion is the probability of getting acquainted.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
That is, the probability that people will get to your information,

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
read it, see it, hear it, and so on.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
The greatest probability of getting acquainted

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
is, of course, industry magazines,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
because people take them on purpose

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
to read, watch, and so on.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
The next criterion is the probability of getting acquainted

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
is, of course, television,

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
because if people watch this program,

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
they will see our advertising, our product.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
The least likely to get acquainted is, of course, newspapers.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
Newspapers are large, there are many strips,

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
and the probability is very small

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
that our customer will read one or another note

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
or see one or another ad or one or another interesting story.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
The next criterion is the rate of accumulation.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Here we assessed

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
how often a certain program, newspaper, or magazine was published.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
That is, how often this information

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
will be accumulated by our customers.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
And here the rate of accumulation

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
is the lowest, of course, for an industry magazine,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
because it is published only once a month.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
The next criterion is the cost of advertising space.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Well, of course, the cost is the most expensive for television.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
The second place is for industry magazines,

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
the cost of space is quite high,

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
and the third place is for newspapers.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
And the last criterion is the useful audience and the degree of penetration.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
What is this criterion?

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
This criterion shows how many of our clients' audience

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
we target advertising.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
And here you see that the largest percentage

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
is, of course, television.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
And the smallest is industry magazines,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
because among those who will read these magazines

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
there are very few end consumers.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
When we assessed all the criteria,

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
we carried out the so-called scaling.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
That is, we determined the scale according to each criterion

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
in order to score.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
We scored, added these points,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
and as a result we got a total score,

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
according to which we actually determined

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
the most attractive media carrier.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
In the example presented,

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
the largest point was received by television.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
And, in fact, we did.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
We advertised our product in the program «Столько одному».

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
And even the fact that it was not allowed to advertise alcohol

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
did not prevent us, because we released a special

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
batch of non-alcoholic wine under the same trademark,

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
which was not prohibited to advertise.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Nevertheless, the brand was heard and constantly

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
associated with our customers with one or another product.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
And when they came to the store,

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
of course, the customers recognized the brand,

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
but they bought, most often, not non-alcoholic wine,

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
but, of course, ordinary wine of the same trademark.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
Thus, such a method will help you

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
assess the attractiveness of a particular media carrier.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
You can adapt and should adapt it

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
to your company, to your product.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
You can replace some criteria.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
You can choose a larger number of media carriers

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
in order to determine the popularity and

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
the prospectivity among your target audience.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
The main thing is to understand what target audience

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
you are counting on and to clearly set all the numbers and points

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
so as not to make a mistake and to achieve

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
the result you planned.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Let's consider the main reasons

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
for the low effectiveness of advertising.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
There are several of them.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
The first one is, of course, the incorrect setting of the goal

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
and task of the advertising campaign.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
What does it mean?

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
It means that your goals are set without numbers.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
They are not clearly and concretely set.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
And, of course, you cannot assess whether your campaign

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
has increased the market share.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
According to the results of the advertising campaign,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
you increased your market share by about 1%.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
Is it good or bad?

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
Nobody knows whether it is good or bad.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Maybe the competitor increased its share by 5% at that time.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Then you were late.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
That is why in order to clearly understand whether your campaign

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
has worked or not, you need to set goals very competently,

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
then you can assess whether you have worked effectively or not.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
The next mistake we make

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
is that we do not have the information of the buyers.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
We do not know where they get the information.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
I will give an example.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
I worked on a consulting project

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
with the director of a company

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
that produced equipment for the food industry.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
The main problem was that the company's

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
production was not well-known to the public.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
The main problem was to advertise our products.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
So, advertising was done everywhere,

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
in principle, competently,

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
in industry sources,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
in mass media,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
at exhibitions, conferences, everything as it should be.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
But there was no result.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
The clients did not come.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
We found out that they get the information

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
from their colleagues in the workshop,

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
consult, ask for recommendations.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
And this is the main source of information

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
about a particular product in this case.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Therefore, ask.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
This way you can optimize your resources

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
and not advertise everywhere.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
The next mistake is the lack of feedback from the consumer.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
You can evaluate the effectiveness

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
if you do not know where they come from,

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
whether they learned about you from this source.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
Companies that specialize in this person

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
do it very well.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
And they ask,

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
where did you learn about our company,

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
from which source?

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
Only then you can evaluate

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
and you will never be able to understand

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
whether you spent your money effectively or not.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
The next main mistake is segmentation.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
Very often we just forget about it.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
It seems to us that we know the circle of our clients,

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
we know who they are, what they do, what they do.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
But in fact, segmentation gives very high costs.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
We shoot at the sparrows with guns

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
because we want to advertise for everyone.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
We ask our customers.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
All ages from 15 to 60 years old.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
This is not segmentation.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
Segmentation is the allocation of a clear group of consumers

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
who make certain requirements for your product.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Based on these requirements,

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
you can make an advertising campaign,

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
and not just general words, general videos, general advertising,

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
which will not give a result,

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
but will be just general information for your customers.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
The next main point, which can be divided into two.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
The first is low qualification of employees

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
who advertise for you.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
Most often we save and say,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
this can be done by any person.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
We hire unqualified employees,

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
save their salary.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Or we just make those who are already in our company advertise.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
But they have never faced this.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
They learn for our money and spend no less

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
than if you paid a qualified specialist.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
And the second point.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
You can contact an advertising agency

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
and they will do this job for you.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
Then your company just needs an organizer,

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
coordinator of activities.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
This is easier and more important.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
You can contact an agency,

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
which will work either professionally or not.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Here is the recommendation.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Choose the agency you work with carefully.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Try to work with an agency that has already had experience

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
in your market.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
With the same goal,

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
so that they do not learn for your money.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
The next mistake is the lack of consistency

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
and the lack of communication.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
What does this mean?

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
It means that we act according to the policy of digging a hole.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
We have a problem, we need to solve it.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
We run to marketers and say,

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
guys, let's urgently do something with this.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
And so we eliminate the consequences of certain actions.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
We do not prevent our failures,

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
but we solve them.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
We try to minimize all these things.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
Therefore, an advertising campaign should be developed,

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
which takes place regularly,

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
which warns of the development of certain situations,

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
which are unfavorably reflected in our business.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
In the light of mistakes,

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
let's look at examples of so-called stupid advertising.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
These are the examples of the most common mistakes.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
The first mistake is that the company does not have a plan.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
These posters, these banners,

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
are posted on the Internet.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Here are two examples.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
The first is an upside-down banner with its head down.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
You know, there was an idea,

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
maybe they did it on purpose

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
to attract attention,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
but then at least they wrote the phone number.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
And so, imagine, who will see this ad?

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
And they will never read it.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
The money is thrown into the wind.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
Another ad.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
Our company Euroseed is famous for its hypocrisy.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
I don't know how to evaluate it,

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
whether this is stupid advertising or not.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
Of course, it is remembered.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
Maybe it was the purpose of the advertising campaign.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
Then it's probably good.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
How does it combine?

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
It's not clear.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
Three more examples from the same series.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
The first is beer advertising.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
The taste of the frozen sun tells us

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
a slogan that is written there.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
You can't come up with a more ridiculous slogan for beer.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
The frozen sun gives away the coldness,

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
gives away something unpleasant,

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
negative.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Of course, it is unlikely to be in favor of this beer,

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
this product.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
Another ad,

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
you know, in the style of the 40s-50s,

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
when the war was going on,

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
and there was advertising,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
you signed up as a volunteer.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Here is something like that.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
This is not a combined ad with a brand.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
It is very interesting how the buyers of this brand

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
reacted to such advertising.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
Another ad, car wash.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Men like it most of all.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
They say that if they saw such advertising,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
they would definitely stop by this car wash.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Nevertheless, you see what is written there.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
No comments.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
PR

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Now let's move on to the consideration of PR functions.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
PR or public communication

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
is what allows companies to maintain

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
their target audience,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
to constantly communicate with customers.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Moreover, more often

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
these are free means of communication

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
with the media.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Attracting media,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
journalists, various publications,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
newspapers,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
to cover the events in your company for free.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
What are the main functions that PR has?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The first is, of course,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
establishing trust between the company itself

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and the public,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
as well as as consumers

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
and as a media outlet.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The second is to create a positive image of the company.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
After all, nothing works like that

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
on the image of the company,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
as a positive image of the company

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
that performs a charity activity,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
holds sponsorship projects,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
constantly announces itself,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
reminds about itself.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
It seems, why do this?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Nevertheless, even Gazprom,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
which seems to be not needed for advertising,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
performs a constant PR activity,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
constantly reminds about itself.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
The Russian Railway Company,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
for example,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
performs a special activity

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
in the form of loyalty to the client,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
in the form of a reminder,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
in the form of a strong, stable, powerful image of the company.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
The next point is to preserve the reputation of the company.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
When is this function applied?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
When there is a crisis in the company

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
or some negative things happen.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It is important to preserve the reputation of the company,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
to come out with a proud face from any situation,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
to interact with the media

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and with the company itself

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
so that some negative information

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
does not seep into the market

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
for the clients and consumers.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
The next main function is internal PR.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The employees feel that they work

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
in a strong and stable company.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
This works to preserve the personnel reserve,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
to preserve the personnel potential,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
to attract new employees, more qualified,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
if the company positions itself as strong,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
if it constantly announces about itself.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Moreover, it works very well

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
for sales in this sense.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
If the employees are loyal to the company,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
they work better and achieve better results.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Another point is to expand the sphere of the company's influence.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It is especially important

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
when the owner of the company

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
or the manager plans

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
to carry out political or social activities.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Naturally, PR is more important here

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
because it influences the relationship

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
with the authorities,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
with the public.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
We have already said that PR is expensive

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
and it should be done constantly and regularly

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
because single programs

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
will not give you a targeted result.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Remember the example of expensive costumes.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
If you bought an expensive costume,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
it does not give you anything.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You need to go further,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
to announce about yourself,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
to support your business.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The company should continue this activity

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
by constantly supporting the opinion

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
of its customers at the same level,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
without falling below.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
What are the main stages of the development

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
of PR events?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
There are several of them,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
but we analyze them first.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
We look at where and how we can hold

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
this campaign.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Naturally, this is followed by a task.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
We must clearly understand

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
what we want to achieve with this event,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
what we do it for,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
what opinion we want to leave in the eyes of customers.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
When the task is determined,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
we choose the agency and develop a program.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It is great when this program is developed

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
for a long time, for example, for a year,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and not a one-time campaign.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
In any case,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
if you do it once or make a plan for a year,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
the agency will need your help.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
When you have made a plan,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
the next step is to develop a cost.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
We calculate how much we need

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
to implement this program.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
The next step is to implement the program itself.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
What I would like to say here is that

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
usually PR events are very clearly scheduled

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
and timed,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
because they are strictly limited in time.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Of course, this timing must be adhered to.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
In the same way,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
this work together with the agency and the company

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
needs to be controlled.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The last and final step is to assess the event,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
how it went,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
what went well, what went wrong,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
where we made mistakes, what we did not take into account.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
This is an important point,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
because any event you have held

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
is not only about PR,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
but also about any other event you hold in the company.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
These are advertising campaigns,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
promotion campaigns, PR campaigns.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Put everything into the database,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
create your own database,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
because only by the results of certain events

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
you can predict the future effectiveness

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
and decide whether to repeat this event or not,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
continue this activity or not.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You can only help the company you attract.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
If they have held certain events,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
they will be able to help you

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and predict the future effectiveness

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and the result,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
whether you will get what you expect or not.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I would like to emphasize one more thing.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
When assessing the event,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
you must be sure that

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
any event related to public communication

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
does not give you a increase in sales for the day after tomorrow.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I have already repeated this,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
but I had an experience

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
when we held a sponsorship event.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Our company was a sponsor of the Kremlin Cup of Ballroom Dancing.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
The event was wonderful,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
we had a lot of participants,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and we were able to make a lot of money.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
We worked with the organizers of the event,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
we were always present,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
we held promotions,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
we awarded winners.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Everything was great.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
The only thing that upset me a little

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
after this event

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
was that the owner invited me to his house

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
and asked me where the increase in sales was.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I told him to warn his managers

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
that the increase in sales would not happen for the day after tomorrow.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
This is a work on an image

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
that is built on a long-term basis.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
What are the main methods of PR?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
What actually helps us to work on this?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
What events?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
The first is the relationship with various journalists,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
with the media, mass media, etc.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
We can release various press releases,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and there is a new product,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and the press releases are usually free.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
The main thing is to make an interesting press release

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
so that the media, newspapers, magazines,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and TV channels can tell about it.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
This is interesting for your clients and consumers.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
The next thing is the interaction with the media.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
This is an interview with your management,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
your owners, managers, top managers,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
who give interviews about the company's activities,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
its plans,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
the results of the activities,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
which are published in various magazines,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
in industry magazines,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
in the general economic,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
in any media that your clients read.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
This is a very important moment,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
because they will remember you,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
they will know about you,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
they will talk about you.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
The next method of PR is various printed products.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
These are our catalogs, booklets,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
press releases,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
which we distribute at exhibitions,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
seminars, conferences,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
where we talk about our experience,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
what we have achieved,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
what results we have obtained,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
what plans we have.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
This is what we want,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
this is what positions us in the eyes of our clients.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Corporate publications can also serve as a PR method.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
The next one of the main methods is photo and film production.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
What is it about?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It is very popular today,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
because we build our trademark,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
our product into certain film and photo plots.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Why?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
In order to constantly remind our customers

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
that this is our product, this is our brand,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and how we position ourselves.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
This is a very effective method,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and the costs for product placement are growing year by year.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
If you buy a certain film or article

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
and you see that certain trademark is being repeated,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
or you hear about them,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
then it is definitely product placement.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
The advantage of this method is that it is repeated.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
You pay once,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
and the film or series is released several times,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
and customers constantly see it and remember your brand.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Of course,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
you can buy it again and again,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
gaining loyalty.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The next one of the main methods is oral speech.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
This is the presentation of companies

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
at any public event.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Conferences, exhibitions,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
press conferences,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
some scientific reports.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Any speech by your company

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
is a PR method.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Therefore, the company must clearly monitor

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
where its employees are speaking,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
what they are saying,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
because they are currently the face of the company

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
and a representative of its target audience.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Another method is sponsorship.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Participation in various associations,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
trade chambers,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
or associations that care about social issues.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It is great if you participate in social projects

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and talk about it.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
It increases the image of the company on the market,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
it increases its value, attractiveness

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
for the main customers.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Therefore, sponsorship events are very often covered.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
We see it at every step.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
There is a sponsor of any project.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
In some cases, there are sponsors of concerts,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
sponsors of orphanages,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
medical institutions.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
We remember and see it.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
We do not forget it as customers.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
If you have an opportunity to apply these methods,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I highly recommend it,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
because it is a long-term work

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
for your positive image of the client.
