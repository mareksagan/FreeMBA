WEBVTT

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.360
So, ladies and gentlemen, we move on

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
to the study of macroeconomics.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.740
See topic 5 on the slide.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.140
Macroeconomic aggregates are

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.820
a large domestic product.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800
Well, let's first remember

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.800
again what macroeconomics actually studies.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.500
Microeconomics – what is it studying?

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.860
The behavior of individual economic

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.140
agents and their interaction in individual

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.880
markets.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.560
Macroeconomics studies the

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.820
economy as a whole.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.920
And the most important methodological

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.980
feature of macroeconomics

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.240
is aggregation, that is, generalization.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.020
The macroeconomic view of the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
national economy distinguishes four

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.780
generalized economic subjects.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.680
This, look at the slide, first

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.320
of all, households.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.180
These are all private economic

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.860
units within the country whose

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.560
activities are aimed

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.700
at meeting their own needs.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.180
Further, macroeconomics distinguishes

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.580
the entrepreneurial sector, that

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.740
is, the whole set of firms

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.140
registered within the country.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.490
The next macroeconomic aggregate

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.910
is the public sector.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.250
It includes all state institutions

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.370
and institutions of the country.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.830
And finally, the fourth aggregate is

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.190
the overseas.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.290
Foreign includes all economic

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.550
entities – both households,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.650
firms, and foreign states,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.590
that is, all entities

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.610
that have a permanent location

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.830
outside the country.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.230


00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.850
That is, four large

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.910
aggregated economic agents

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.550
operate in the macroeconomy

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.690
– households, firms, the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.630
state, abroad.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.330
Macroeconomic aggregation

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.850
extends to markets.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.390
The macroeconomic view distinguishes

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.870
four aggregated markets.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.270
It is the commodity market, labour market,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.030
money market and securities market.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.470
Note that in macroeconomics

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.590
there is no market for

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.830
separate goods, separate

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.870
goods.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.770
There is no oil market, wheat

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.310
market, or gold market.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.250
In macroeconomics, there is a single market

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.170
that unites all the benefits.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.390
In this market, the total

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.630
volume, the total volume, the national

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.870
production, the social production,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.470
the domestic product

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.690
are sold and bought.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.590
Let's talk about the domestic product.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.670
The domestic product is the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.010
market value of all

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.670
goods and services intended

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.350
for final consumption

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.150
and produced in the country

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.850
over a certain period

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.770
of time.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.410
If, to imagine a domestic

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.250
product, it is best to imagine

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.230
the economy in the form of a

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.010
giant supermarket.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.030
This supermarket exhibits all goods

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.250
and services produced over a certain

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.650
period of time in the territory

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.430
of the country.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.870
All goods and services are intended

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.370
for final consumption.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.830
Here in this corner, for example, nuclear

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.450
submarines, in this corner, bakeries,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.270
there costumes, here cars, there

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.650
are the services of doctors, teachers

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.390
and artists.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.850
The whole set of goods and services

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.550
intended for final consumption

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.290
forms the domestic

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.950
product.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.730
I want to draw your attention to the fact

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.450
that the domestic product includes

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.450
cars, but does not include steel, does

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.010
not include metal, which went to

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.030
the production of cars.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.870
The domestic product of the

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.730
wool consists of goods

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.330
intended for final consumption.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.370
Products intended for intermediate

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.830
consumption are not included

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.550
in the wool domestic product.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.470
There are cars, but no

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.630
metal.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.710
Dresses are included, but no wool is included,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.550
no fabric is included.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.230
Includes gasoline if it

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.650
is sold if it is sold to car enthusiasts.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.610
It is considered the final product.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.830
But the price of oil in the domestic

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.810
product is not included.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.150
Oil is the raw material for the production of gasoline.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.190
Gasoline is in, but there is no oil.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.450
The only necessary reservation.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.270
The price of oil is taken into

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.250
account when calculating the

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.490
domestic product if oil goes

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.850
for export.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.870
Oil is the final product

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.850
of our economy.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.030
The problem now is how to measure

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.870
GDP – the domestic product.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.330
There are three ways to measure GDP.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.600
To better understand these ways, let'

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.140
s go back to my conditional example

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.920
with the supermarket.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.940
This conditional supermarket

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.260
exhibits all goods and services

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.300
intended for final consumption

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.140
and produced in the

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.840
country.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.220
How can we find out the value of this

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.060
total GDP?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.800
Well, the easiest way is to circumvent

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.160
all the shelves, rewrite

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.000
prices, multiply by volumes,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.720
and then fold.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.780
This means that we measure

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.200
GDP by cost of production

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.380
or production methods.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.100
See, the first way to

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.300
measure GDP by cost of production.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.240
How can we measure?

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.470
We assume that if a product is

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.050
produced, it will be bought by someone

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.730
else.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.430
If a product is produced but not yet purchased,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.410
here is a small statistical

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.450
nuance of its accounting when calculating

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.750
GDP.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.870
But let's first assume that everything

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.470
that is produced is bought by someone.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.030
How can we measure

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.050
GDP?

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.970
You can, conditionally speaking, after

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.930
the end of the trading day to remove the cash.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.300
If a product is purchased by someone,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.700
the value of the product

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.660
is equal to the sum of the

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.960
costs of all consumers.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.560
The second way to measure GDP is

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.380
by the sum of all consumer expenses.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.140
This method of measuring

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.560
GDP is called the end-use method.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.400
The third method is based on the

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.100
sum of primary income or the sum of the

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.260
income of all the participants in production.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.820
This is called the

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.000
distribution method.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.140
What is this method based on?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.500
It is based on the fact that

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.160
if consumers paid some amount of

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.680
money, the product they bought,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:25.840
that money did not disappear.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.940
They became the income of those who participated

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.100
in the production process.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.350
Well, look, let's give an example

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.330
so that you can, maybe, better

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.470
understand it.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:55.090
You bought this audio course.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:05.620
It is printed in a 100 copy printing.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.960
Each copy, let's say, costs

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.940
100 rubles.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.070
How can this rate contribute to

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.450
the GDP of Russia?

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.230
Can be calculated how.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.250
10 copies or 100 copies.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.610
Each copy costs 100 rubles.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.250
This is the final product.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.730
The cost, cost, total cost

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.050
is 10 thousand rubles.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.710
This is the first way.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.610
GDP is measured by production method.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:49.990
and further.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.850
Someone bought this course.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.790
Can I do anything?

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.590
Put all the costs, all buyers

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.410
on this, to purchase this

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.490
course.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.690
It will be the same 10,000 rubles.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.310
And then what?

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.630
If you paid for this course,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.930
someone got that money.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.050
Who was who got?

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.030
For example, I am.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.670
Who else?

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.170
All those who have participated

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.230
in this course.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.150
So your course expenses

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.330
turned into what?

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.270
The income of those who participated in its creation.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.430
Here it turns out that GDP can be measured

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.390
once again in the patria in three ways.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.630
The first way how?

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.170
by cost of production.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.190
The second is the total cost of all consumers.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.050
The third method, by the sum of the

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.310
income of all producers involved in its

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.930
creation, in the creation of this product.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.990
If we use all three methods correctly,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.030
they should give the same

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.530
result.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:11.830
In this painting I tried to

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.870
paint the same thing, paint

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.090
the same thing.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.350
What is in the center?

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.430
The domestic product.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.550
This is the value of all final

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.510
goods and services produced

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.070
in the country.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.830
What is on the left?

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.070
expenses of all consumers.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.330
In macroeconomics, we distinguish

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.570
four main groups of consumers.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.890
Who buys our goods?

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.550
Who is, in our case, in the

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.810
rows in our supermarket?

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.290
Who is on one side?

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.650
households buying goods

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.310
for personal use.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.590
Who is on the other side?

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.610
Companies that buy goods for

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.050
production consumption.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.870
End products for production

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.230
consumption are machines,

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.550
machines, equipment,

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.270
buildings, structures.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.430
The cost will also be included in GDP.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.110
Who else is in our supermarket?

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.170
State officials.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.330
They buy goods

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.750
for the state.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.110
And finally, the last group

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.390
of buyers, who are you, see below?

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.430
The Foreigners.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.470
Foreigners we buy and understand everyone.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.370
Foreign firms, foreign

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.030
governments, and foreign

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.990
households.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.530
Is the value of GDP

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.550
equal to what?

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.650
Costs of all consumers.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.550
I repeat, states, households,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.390
firms and foreigners.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.670
What happens next?

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.110
The arrows are right in the revenue direction.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.330
This means that the expenses of some

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.210
have become the income of others.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.680
When the GDP is sold, who gets

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.540
their share?

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.310
Employees in the form of pay.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.860
Capitalists receive a percentage on the

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.860
invested capital.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.070
Shareholders receive dividends.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.610
Land owners receive rent.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.110
Entrepreneurs are making profits.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.210
These are the main types of income.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.550
This figure is intended

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.850
to make it clear that the sum,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.790
the cost of production, is

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.110
equal to the sum of costs.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.330
What is produced, who is bought.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.610
The expenses are turned into whose income.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.730
We see here the four main groups

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.010
of buyers and the main types

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.450
of income in the market economy.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:42.970
Now here is an important nuance.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:51.210
In the 92nd year, Russia'

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.150
s GDP was about 640 billion rubles.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.610
By 2007, it would be

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.050
more than 27 trillion rubles.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:15.810
Does this mean that GDP has grown somewhere

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.670
47 times over that period?

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.460
What is the real social production

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.520
increased by 47 times?

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.680
Absolutely not.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.220
GDP cannot be measured in pieces,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.340
in tons, in meters of

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.460
vehicles.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.440
GDP can be measured in rubles.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.940
The tables are different.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.820
They can be brought to a single

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.120
denominator only by means of

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.540
a ruble measurement.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.720
And if so, the size of GDP is influenced,

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.920
on the one hand, by the change in the

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.560
physical volumes of products produced,

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.900
and on the other hand by the change

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.740
in prices.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.280
There is a distinction between

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.840
nominal and real GDP.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.820
We read the definition on the slide.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.870
Nominal GDP is GDP calculated

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.730
in current prices.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.820
And when I say that Russia's

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.360
GDP in 1992 was 640 billion

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.880
rubles, and now it will soon

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:58.520
exceed 27 trillion rubles,

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.360
I am speaking precisely of

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.680
a change in nominal GDP.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.230
Why is nominal GDP changing?

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.130
influenced by two factors.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.970
The first factor is the change

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.830
in physical production volumes.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.290
The second factor is price change.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.670
And if we do not want to take into account

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.210
the change in prices, we want

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.090
to level the change in prices, we want

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.570
to take into account only the change

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.770
in production volumes?

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.450
We have to calculate

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.490
real GDP.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.770
We read.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.730
Real GDP is GDP calculated

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.370
in constant prices, for which

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.070
prices of a certain

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.050
base year are taken.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:04.670
Well, let's get to understand this

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.090
better, again, let's go back to our example

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.730
with a conditional supermarket.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.130
Come to this supermarket in which

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.890
year, I repeat again, here are

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.850
all the final goods and services

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.230
produced in the country for

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:23.870
the year.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.110
Look in that corner.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.890
In this corner, let's say, there

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.970
are nuclear submarines.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.930
Two nuclear submarines each

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.630
cost a billion rubles.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.510
In this corner, let's say, 100

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.050
million baked beets.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.010
Each cake costs 10 rubles.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.130
In this corner of the costume,

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.670
there are cars, there are services and

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.590
so on and so on.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.230
What can we do?

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.750
We can multiply the prices by the volume

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.370
of all the different goods, then put together

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.830
the result, and what will we get?

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.580
GDP measured in current prices.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.600
at this year's prices.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.830
I'll go to the supermarket

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.710
next year.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.470
What will change?

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.180
On the one hand, the production volume will

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.320
change, on the other hand, the prices

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.620
will change.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.460
What do we see in this corner?

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.300
There were two nuclear submarines,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.840
each costing a billion, now

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.020
let's say one nuclear submarine

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.820
costs a billion and

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.140
a half.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.800
In this corner, there were

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.300
100 million baked beets worth

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.200
10 rubles each, and now 200

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.200
million baked beets worth 15

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.960
rubles each.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.280
What can we do?

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.160
Again, we will multiply the volumes

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.500
by prices, put together the results and

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.800
eventually get the GDP already calculated

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.880
in new prices, in new year prices.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.000
Again, we will get nominal GDP already

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.260
at new prices, at new year's prices.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.410
Why has it changed compared to

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.070
last year?

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:30.650
A. the

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.810
The price has changed, B.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.610
The volume of production has changed.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.350
And I want to exclude the change

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:46.750
in prices, to see how the change

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.870
in production only affected GDP.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.770
What would you advise me?

00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:00.120
You can take new volumes of the production

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.000
of different goods and services and multiply

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.440
by the old prices.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.810
It is estimated how much the

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:14.110
GDP would cost if prices remained unchanged.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.710
As a result, we got what?

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:24.110
Real GDP or GDP measured in

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.230
base year prices.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:29.790
What year is the base?

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.310
It depends on the goals.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.530
If we want to see how the real

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.010
GDP has changed since the start

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.450
of market reforms, the base year

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.510
must be taken 91th year.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.410
Reforms began in the year 92.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.090
If we want to see how the GDP changed

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.490
in the new millennium, we need

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.490
to take the 2000s as the base.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:07.800
Now let's fix this with a simple

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.860
conditional example.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.860
Suppose that there is only

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.640
one product in the economy

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.500
– baked beef.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.620
Let in a certain base year 100

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.720
pancakes were produced, and

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.980
each sold for 1 ruble.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:51.030
In the reporting year, 50 pancakes

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.110
were produced, each being sold for 4

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.430
rubles.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.520
Let's fill the table together.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.900
Nominal GDP and real GDP.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:54.420
This is a base year, this is a report year.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.300
Try to fill.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:14.040
What was the nominal GDP in the

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:14.780
base year?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.540
How much he made?

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.640
How many baked?

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.260
100 is

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.720
Each was sold for rubles.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.420
The nominal GDP was 100

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.020
rubles.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:46.490
What is the nominal GDP in the reporting

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.370
year?

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.670
How much produced?

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.550
50 cups of cake.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.710
Each is sold for 4 rubles.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.510
The nominal GDP in current prices

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.930
in the reporting year is 200 rubles.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.250
What is the real GDP in the base year?

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.700
In the base year, nominal

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.240
and real GDP must coincide.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.150
Because prices have not changed yet.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.870
The real GDP in the

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.250
base year is 100 rubles.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.340
How do you calculate real GDP

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.020
in the year?

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.460
What should be done?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.460
The new volume of the issue must be multiplied

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.940
by the old price.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.280
It is 50 rubles.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.340
What are we watching?

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.830
Nominal GDP increased twice in the

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.110
reporting year compared to the

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.030
base year.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:38.530
Real GDP has fallen twice.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.090
This is a childhood example.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.430
And so clearly, real GDP has fallen.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.350
Why clear?

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.270
We have a single-products economy.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.910
Accordingly, we see that the

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.830
baking was 100, became 50.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.910
Production has dropped by half.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.990
When we have a single-product

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.090
economy, we can measure output in

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.630
pieces.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.770
But when we have a lot of goods,

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.650
we can measure both nominal and

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.690
real GDP only in rubles.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.710
And we see that in rubles real GDP

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.610
was 100, and became 50.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.110
He fell exactly twice.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.960
Now look at.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.900
The relationship between nominal

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.880
and real GDP can be described

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.640
by formulas.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.220
Look at the slide.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.280
The first formula.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.880
Nominal GDP is equal to real GDP

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.080
multiplied by the price index.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.540
Let's test this formula on our

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.020
simple numbers.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.760
What is the nominal GDP in the reporting

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.560
year?

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.420
200 rubles

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.840
What is the real GDP of the reporting year?

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.880
50 rubles

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.100
What is the price index?

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.300
The index is a factor

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.580
that shows how many times

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:51.280
the indicator changed in

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.700
the new year compared

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.180
to the base year.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.440
How much did the cake cost?

00:29:59.220 --> 00:29:59.920
The ruble.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.460
How much is it now?

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.540
4 of rubles.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.560
What is the price index?

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.320
The price of the bullets increased 4 times, meaning

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.700
the price index is equal to 4.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.870
All coincided.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.150
Nominal GDP is equal to real GDP

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.850
multiplied by the price index.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.650
And the second formula that can be used.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:37.310
The nominal GDP index is equal to

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.450
the real GDP index multiplied by the

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.350
price index.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.390
Check the formula.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.540
What is the nominal GDP index?

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.840
It was 100 rubles.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.140
Is it equal to what?

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:58.860
The word is 100 rubles.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.320
The nominal GDP index, the new indicator

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.460
divided by the old indicator

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:07.340
is equal to 2.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.800
What is the real GDP index?

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.320
How much was real GDP?

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.220
100 now 50.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.420
Divide the new indicator by the old,

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.860
we get the real GDP index.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.900
0 to 5.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.250
The price index is 4.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.110
Everything goes together again.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.850
And now let's think about how

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.110
we can use this theory to analyze

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.150
how the real GDP changes

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.250
in the Russian economy.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.210
The State Statistics Service publishes

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.850
data on the change in nominal GDP by year.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.190
What can we do?

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.410
Let's say we are interested in how

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:18.110
much real GDP grew or fell in 2007.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.750
We have to wait for nominal

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.750
GDP data in 2006 and 2007.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:33.530
Divide the nominal GDP of 2007 by

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.240
the nominal GDP of 2006.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.200
What will we get?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.300
The nominal GDP index.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:52.690
Then we need to find data on price

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.750
changes for this year.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.570
The price index used to link

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.190
nominal and real GDP

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.970
is called the deflator

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.370
of GDP.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.620
If we find a deflator of GDP, what

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.680
can we do?

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.760
The nominal GDP index is divided by

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.960
this price index or deflator of GDP.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.200
This is the real GDP

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.720
index.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.860
Suppose it was 1.07.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.820
What does this mean?

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.440
That real GDP for 2007 increased

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:55.500
by 1.07 times or 7%.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.080
In addition to GDP, there are a

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.840
number of macroeconomic indicators.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.960
Let us talk about them.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.930
First of all, we distinguish between

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.730
the domestic product and the

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.130
national income.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.300
Look at the slide.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:35.440
GDP is the product produced in

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:38.920
the country by both residents

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:42.300
and non-residents.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.020
Residents are considered persons, not

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.200
necessarily citizens of a country, but

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.060
those who have, as they say, the center

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.960
of economic interest in the territory

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:54.380
of that country.

00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:57.400
You can not be a citizen, but a resident.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.570
GNI (Bill National Income) is the sum of

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.850
primary income received by residents

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.050
of a given country as a result of

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.170
their participation in the creation of

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.770
GDP of that country, as well as GDP of

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.190
other countries.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.800
Let us give an example.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:27.990
Let's say that Russians work abroad.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.830
They are therefore involved in creating the GDP

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.230
of other countries.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.930
But by participating in its creation,

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.950
they get some income.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.770
Their income is the income of Russian

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.690
residents, although received abroad.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:53.470
Their income is part of the

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.270
Russian national income.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:04.820
On the other hand, if, say, an American

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.550
resident works in Russia, he participates

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.830
in the creation of Russia'

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.970
s GDP.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.780
The income will be included in the GDP

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.760
of Russia.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.780
But at the same time, it is the income

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.920
of the American resident, so it will enter

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.440
the VAT, the wave of the national

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.360
income of the United States.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:37.900
Look at the slide formula.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.280
GNI is equal to the national

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:45.200
income, GDP plus the balance

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.600
of primary income received from

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.760
abroad or transferred abroad.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:58.630
Let us take a look at this example

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.590
with you.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:08.550
Let the foreigners not participate

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.050
in the Russian economy by their

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.170
labor, their capital, or anything.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:13.630


00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.310
Russians work abroad.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.400
The GDP of Russia was 100

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.280
rubles.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:32.430
In addition, the Russians earned

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.410
10 rubles abroad.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.600
GDP is 100.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.620
In addition to the income received by Russians

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:48.980
abroad, there are 10 more.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.140
The GNV is 110.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.780
GDP, the largest institutional income

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:59.520
of Russia, exceeded its GDP.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.800
The reverse example.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.920
Suppose the Russians are not

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.320
in any way involved in creating

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:09.540
foreign GDP.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.320
Foreigners are contributing

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.880
their capital to the Russian GDP.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:25.400
GDP of Russia is 100 rubles.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.360
But, let's say, of these 100 rubles,

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.820
5 rubles is the income

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.920
of foreign residents.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.140
Therefore, in order to calculate the GNI of

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:46.460
Russia, these 5 rubles must be deducted from the GDP.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.320
100 rubles of the total GDP of Russia, including

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.200
5 rubles, is the contribution of

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.480
foreigners to the creation of our GDP.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.560
The gross national income of Russia,

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:04.360
the Russians, is 95.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.060
And if there are both, that is, we are

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.380
participating in creating

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.520
foreign GDP, foreigners are

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.220
participating in creating our GDP,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.280
what should we do?

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.540
It is necessary to add to GDP the

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.500
balance of income received from abroad

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.560
and transferred abroad.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.920
100 plus 10 minus 5.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.360
Our GDP is 100 and our GNI is 105.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:50.810
In general, GDP and GNI

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.030
differ little.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.470
Well, on the one hand, we participate

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.550
in creating foreign GDP, foreigners

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.190
participate in creating

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.290
our GDP.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.550
Approximately one is paying.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.350
Well usually.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.630
There is an exception.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.190
For example, in many post-Soviet republics

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.070
of the CIS, the national

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.090
income is significantly higher

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.350
than their GDP.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.930
Why is?

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.530
Because they, many of the

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.590
residents of these republics,

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.370
work in Russia.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:38.110
Their income is included in the GDP of Russia,

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.890
but in the GNI of their republics, whose

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.010
residents they are.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.310
And the last macroeconomic

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.750
indicator that I would like to stop at.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.710
This is the national disposable

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.470
income.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.890
Look at the slide.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.950
It is considered to be the sum

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.510
of the current national income and the

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.030
balance of current transfers.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.280
What are transfers?

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.020
These are unpaid payments,

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.680
unpaid receipts.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.600
The balance of current transfers

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.960
means that we send, for

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:35.840
example, humanitarian aid or transfers

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:39.680
free of charge to other countries.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.820


00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.570
So the money is leaving the country.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.010
Foreigners are helping

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.490
us.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:56.510
The GNI of Russia was 105

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.410
rubles.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.050
We just counted.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:03.810
We received from abroad

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:07.390
free aid, suppose, for 3

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:15.830
rubles.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.870
And sent abroad free assistance,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.310
in the form of all kinds

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.730
of transfers, relatives,

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.000
for example.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.970
4 of rubles.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.880
So it succeeded.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.460
Saldo minus one.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.180
The gross national

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.140
income is 104 rubles.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.160
So I need what?

00:42:53.760 --> 00:43:00.080
To the CIS to add the free

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.440
receipts overseas and deduct

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.720
what we send overseas free of charge.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.600
In the end, the gross national

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.900
disposable income is divided

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.140
into national final

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:18.280
consumption and national

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:20.780
savings.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:26.690
Well, ladies and gentlemen, let'

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.790
s start our next topic.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.290
Total demand, total supply

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.890
and macroeconomic problems.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.890
But first I would like to express

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.910
a scarce hope that you still remember

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.530
the topic of demand and offer

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.570
from the course of microeconomics.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.190
Well, let's all — so we'll try to

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.470
quickly remember something.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.450
We had such a simple model.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.700
What did X postpone?

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.440
quantity of the goods.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.720
How did we measure the quantity of goods?

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.920
in physical units.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.540
Maybe in pieces, maybe in tons,

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.060
maybe in meters, in purses,

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.320
in anything.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.800
in physical units.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.960
What have we put off on the axis?

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.320
price of this goods.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.700
What did we measure?

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.140
In currency, in rubles.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.540
We had a demand function.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.580
This is such.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.460
Demand and Demand.

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:49.220
It was a function of proposal.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.260
Swept the proposals.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.540
What allowed us to define this model?

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.580
We could find out the balance price

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.000
of this product by this model.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.880
and its balance in the market.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.390
In the microeconomics, it was

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.790
a market for individual goods.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.010
In macroeconomics, if you remember,

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.590
there are no individual products.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:31.870
Here we unite all the markets

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.990
of individual goods into a single common

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.970
aggregate market, where all goods

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.870
and services are sold and purchased.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.810


00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.010
Therefore, here on the axis

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.430
X we are no longer laying off

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.450
the quantity of the individual

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.870
commodity, but the total volume

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.670
of social production.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.650
But again, if you remember,

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:10.030
there is a nominal GDP and

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.470
a real GDP.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.070
So when we build the model

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.250
of total demand, total supply

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.630
on the X-axis, we

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.530
postpone the real GDP.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.840
It is marked by the letter Y.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.220
This is real GDP.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.340
What can it be measured?

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.260
Of course, only in rubles, only

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.120
in monetary units.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.580
Because in macroeconomics, cars cannot

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.220
be summed up with chocolate.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.380
Only money is the common measure of

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.840
the whole volume of production.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.260
Therefore, here we repeat again,

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.100
we postpone the real GDP measured

00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.820
in rubles.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.010
What have we repeated before, postponed

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.990
on the axis Y?

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.910
The price of this product in rubles.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.130
This is not possible in macroeconomics.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.090
There is no separate product.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.070
And here you can't sum up the price of

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.650
a car with the price of chocolate.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:26.010
Here we put the overall price

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.310
level in relative units or price

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.970
index on the Y axis.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:32.990
How to understand?

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.150
Also indicated p.

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:38.470
But it is not the price in rubles.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.470
This is a price level or price index.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.250
Again, how to understand?

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:49.410
We are the price of a year, what level

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.970
of prices we take for the unit.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.010
So, the number 2 what does it mean now?

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:02.770
Prices have doubled.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.770
Number 3 is that prices have tripled.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:10.610
So I repeat again.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:13.950
Previously there were rubles, now

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.410
there are price indices.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:21.550
On the axis x, I repeat, real GDP in

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.090
rubles.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.130
After this preamble, we can

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.150
actually begin to consider

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.690
the first question of this topic.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:33.890
Please look at the slide.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.940
Here are the topics of the topic

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:38.960
on this slide.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.360
The first question is the overall demand

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.660
and its factors.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.040
The first question is the

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:51.640
overall demand and its factors.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.060
First, the definition of total demand.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.160
It is very simple.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.300
Look at the slide.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.660
Total demand is the real GDP that

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.080
all buyers are willing to purchase

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.800
during a given time at

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.200
different price levels.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.080
And, as you can remember, there

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.340
was a law of demand in the microeconomy.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.940
How did it sound simplified?

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.600
The cheaper the goods, the more

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.360
equals will want to buy.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.920
The law of total demand

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.600
is similar.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.540
Please see the wording

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.540
of the law on the slide.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.180
The law of total demand.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.680
The lower the price level in the economy,

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.920
the greater the demand of all

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.940
consumers for real GDP.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:52.220
In other words, if all goods, if

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.840
the price level as a whole

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:57.960
is lower, then all goods as a

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.860
whole, consumers are willing

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.380
to buy more.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.740
Here we see the overall demand

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:08.660
function on the chart.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.820
You see, it has a negative tilt,

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:13.020
which corresponds to the formulation

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:16.240
of the law of aggregate demand.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.580
The lower the price level, the greater

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.120
the total demand.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.820
How does it derive this function

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.640
of aggregate demand?

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.440
It can be derived from the quantitative

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.760
theory of money.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.360
Look at the next slide, this is

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:39.020
the equation.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.620
Multiply by p is equal to multiply

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:43.840
by y.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.140
m is the amount of money in the economy.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.100
The rate of circulation of money is,

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:56.220
in other words, how many times during

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.920
a certain time each ruble passes from

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.140
hand to hand or in how many transactions

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.680
it participates.

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.440
Well, p you know, we have already

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:08.240
said p is the overall price level in

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:09.260
the economy.

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.680
and real GDP.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:18.140
This is not actually an equation.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:22.370
It is identity.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:27.470
If one variable changes,

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.610
the other or two,

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.950
or all three, must

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.790
change.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.860
How can this identity be justified?

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.780
Equation from the quantitative theory

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.220
of money.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.080
Multiply by p is equal to multiply

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:56.580
by y.

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:00.350
I will try to explain it on the simplest

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.490
example.

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:04.890
Well, let's the most primitive

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.690
situation, we have a single-products economy.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:11.170
Only one product is produced.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.170
Let the baked.

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:21.710
Suppose it is printed,

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.250
say, 100 rubles.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:27.770
That is, in the economy, it turns,

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:29.830
goes from hand to hand 100 rubles.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.460
M is 100.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.340
Let us also assume that every ruble

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:42.300
passes from hand to hand for a certain

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:44.240
period of time, let it be a year,

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.360
conditionally, 5 times.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:06.510
Let us also assume that everything was

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.220
produced during this time.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:16.660
Let's say 50 cakes.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.900
In this case, each piece

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:25.780
of cake should cost 10 rubles.

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:26.620


00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.240
Now let's think about

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:39.120
what will change if, say,

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.680
more money is printed.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.840
Instead of 100 rubles, print 200.

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:51.010
What can change?

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.290
There may be different options.

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:59.350
For example, it may be that the baked

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.110
beans are traveling.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.790
So, how much will each

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.090
cake cost?

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:11.770
Not 10 but 20 rubles.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.130
But the baked bread may not travel.

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:20.670
In the event that the growth of the money

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.130
mass will correspond to the growth of the

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.690
release of these pancakes, that is,

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:30.130
the parameter Y will change, not the

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.650
parameter P.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.860
And finally, the baked beans may not

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:39.820
be more expensive, even if their

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.360
quantity, the volume of production will

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:42.300
remain the same.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.880
But then what is needed?

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:50.970
The speed of money circulation slowed.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.210
And so always.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:54.450
If one parameter changes,

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:56.770
the other will change, or two

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.510
others, or all three others.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:07.060
Please look at the slide

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:10.480
again.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.860
Here it is written, rewriting

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:18.060
this equation, we get equal m multiplied

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:21.080
by v divided by p.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.640
This is the equation

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.360
of total demand.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.040
What does it show?

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:37.770
That with these values m and v together

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.560
with the rise of p, that is, the level of

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:47.400
prices, y will necessarily decrease.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.860
That is, the higher the price

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.660
level, the less the demand of all

00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.600
consumers for real GDP is.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:06.300
Again, if you remember the supply

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:07.680
demand model in microeconomics,

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:10.520
it was said that the demand function

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.960
can shift to the right or

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.860
to the left.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.120
The same goes for macroeconomics.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.920
The aggregate demand function can also

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:30.160
shift to the right or to the left.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:34.700
What does it mean if it moved to the right?

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.380
Look at the slide, please.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.920
This means that at the same price

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:47.580
level, all consumers want to buy

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.520
more of all goods and services

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.460
than before.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.240
On the contrary, if the combined demand

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.500
function shifts to the left,

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.880
it means that at the same price

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:04.000
level consumers want to buy all

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:06.900
the goods less than before.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.060
The demand for real GDP is decreasing.

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:15.900
And now the main question

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.020
to be answered is why the aggregate

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:21.220
demand can still increase, that

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.420
is, the aggregate demand curve

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:26.080
is shifting to the right, or it

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.460
can decrease and the aggregate

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.420
demand curve can shift to

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:32.360
the left.

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.060
Please look at the previous

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.980
slide.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:42.880
The previous slide.

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.040
As I said before, the total

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:51.320
demand is divided into four

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:53.120
components.

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.180
Four components of.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.920
In macroeconomics, we divide all

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.100
consumers into four groups.

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.800
Not by gender, not by age, not by

00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:08.940
income, but by the peculiarities of

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:10.400
their consumer behavior.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:15.400
In this regard, we distinguish four

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:17.640
groups of consumers.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.780
The first group of consumers

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:26.080
are households, families, individuals.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.780
The second group of consumers are companies.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:34.680
The third group is the state.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.900
The fourth group is foreigners.

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.900
Accordingly, the total demand, read

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:46.020
on the slide, is broken down into,

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.260
first, the costs of private

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:56.280
consumers, marked by the letter C.

00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:59.880
Consumption is consumer expenses.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.080
On the other hand, companies, if

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.440
you remember, buy machines, machines,

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.880
equipment, and so on.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.080
This is called investment

00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:12.420
demand.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.800
The second part of the total

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:16.680
demand is the investment

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.860
costs of the companies.

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.400
The third is the expenses of the state.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.240
The fourth part is foreign

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:30.380
expense or net export.

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.280
And if you look at the aggregate demand

00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:37.320
from this perspective, the equation

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:39.580
of aggregate demand takes

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:40.820
shape.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.020
Look at the slide.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:48.120
Y is C plus I plus G plus X N.

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.050
What comes from here?

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.900
The increase of any of these

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.580
components of aggregate demand at a given

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.180
price level leads to the fact that the

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.740
curve A and D, the curve of

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.380
aggregate demand, shifts to the right.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.780
And the opposite.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.840
The decrease of any of these components

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:19.900
of the aggregate demand at the same time,

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.580
at the unchanged level of prices, entails

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.620
a shift of the aggregate demand

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:27.920
curve to the left.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.660
That is, the overall demand is decreasing.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.780
Well, this is actually shown on the slide,

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:36.500
which you have already looked at a little

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:37.280
earlier.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.040
We can see it again,

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:41.360
on the same slide.

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:49.570
Curve A, D can shift to the right or to

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.690
the left.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.260
The question that we

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:59.320
must answer is the following.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.180
Why, in fact, can the consumer

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.910
demand of households, or the investment

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.830
demand of firms, or

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.070
the expenses of the state,

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.310
or the expenses of foreigners change?

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:14.770
What factors are these components dependent on?

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.080
That is what we will talk about now.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.340
See the next slide.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.080
We read.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.540
Consumer demand of households

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:31.980
depends mainly on the first

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.110
factor of the total income

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.050
of all consumers, or national

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.430
income.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.200
From accumulated wealth, from

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:46.100
the size of consumer

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:48.140
debt, consumer expectations,

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.080
taxes, transfers,

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.440
interest rate.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.820
Well, let's talk about some

01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.720
of these factors a little.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.480
Well look at.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:06.140
Suppose the national income has increased.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.600
Consumer income has increased.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.720
What does that mean?

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.960
That if you become richer, then at

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:18.980
the same price level, you will

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:21.840
buy different goods and services in

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:23.360
general more.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.000
Your expenses will increase and the curve of the

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:31.020
hell will shift to the right.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:37.610
Now, let's talk about the fourth

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.830
factor, consumer expectations.

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:46.290
Remember, we talked about expectations,

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.230
again, in the microeconomy, in the

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.830
model of supply and demand.

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:54.890
What expectations were there?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.520
If you remember, about the expectations

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.500
of price changes of goods.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.520
That is, if people expect that the

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:12.880
product will be more expensive,

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:15.840
they will buy it at the same price, usually

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.490
at the current price.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.100
In macroeconomics, we also talk about

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:28.340
expectations, but still most often about

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:32.700
expectations of changes in consumer income.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.640
Imagine such a situation.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.040
Don't give God you expect your income

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:45.080
to be reduced soon.

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:49.040
Your company is going through difficult times.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.900
Maybe you will even be fired.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.520
Today, your income has not changed,

01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:00.040
but your expectations for income in

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:02.420
the future are unfavorable.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.540
How will this affect your consumer

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.120
behavior today?

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:14.140
You will probably save.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.380
You will put more money off on a

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:20.180
black day.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.600
In other words, you will

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.300
save most of your income.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.500
Your expenses will decrease.

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:30.110
The curve of hell will then

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.190
move to the left.

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:33.370
If everyone thinks so.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.530
All consumers think that there

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:38.470
are tough times ahead.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.860
Let's look at the last factor.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.860
The interest rate.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.320
This factor plays an increasingly

01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:48.520
important role.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.240
Why is?

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:55.610
A significant share of our purchases are already

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.870
made in credit in Russia.

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:02.470
Accordingly, if the interest rate

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.190
is high, then we will most likely

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.050
take less money out of loan.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.790
So less and spend.

01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:13.670
That is, at a high interest

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.750
rate, the household's consumer

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.970
expenses will be less.

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:18.510
And lowly the opposite.

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:25.190
More details about these factors

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.210
are discussed in the texts of the lectures.

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:29.110
And we will go on.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.880
Now the next slide,

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:34.100
please look.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:41.510
It is devoted to investment demand

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.510
or investment costs of firms.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.300
What depends on investment demand?

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.860
From the real interest rate

01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:54.240
outlined, look at the slide,

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.340
the national income, expected

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.620
investment profits, taxes paid

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.740
by companies and received

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:06.060
on behalf of grants.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.380
Let us talk about how these factors affect.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:16.940
But above all, here I would like

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:21.820
to emphasize that in macroeconomics

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.660
we share the nominal interest

01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:30.640
rate and the real interest rate.

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:34.890
The nominal interest rate, look

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:38.550
at the slide, is the rate at

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.150
which a loan agreement is

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.850
concluded, at which

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.950
funds are borrowed on the financial

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.310
markets.

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:51.930
The real interest rate is a change

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.950
in the purchasing power

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.350
of interest income.

01:06:57.450 --> 01:07:00.190
The relationship between nominal and

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.810
real interest rates is determined

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.910
by the Fisher equation.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:09.350
It's very simple, look at the slide.

01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:12.490
The real interest rate is equal to the

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.950
nominal interest rate minus the

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.390
rate of inflation.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.400
Let us give the simplest example.

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:29.780
The loan contract is under 10% of the annual.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.320
This is the nominal interest rate.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.780
At the same time, during the year, prices

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:43.220
increased by 4%.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.340
I think we will come to a situation

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:47.560
when we have inflation

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:50.500
not above 4% a year.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:51.820
This is still considered to be a

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:54.680
lot of the standards of developed economies.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.580
Well well well.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.260
Let it be 4%.

01:07:58.270 --> 01:07:59.420
What does this mean?

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.060
10% minus 4%.

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:05.940
The real interest rate is 6%.

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:09.880
This is the percentage that the lender

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:12.460
actually receives from the money

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:13.960
borrowed.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.220
Dependence is not difficult.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.400
The lower the real interest rate,

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:24.640
the higher the investment costs of the

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:26.000
companies.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.080
Please look at the slide.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.580
At high interest rates, firms

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.200
will borrow little money in

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.500
banks and, accordingly,

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.920
invest, buy new equipment

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:39.680
will also be for small

01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:41.920
amounts.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:45.320
At low interest rates, firms

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.200
borrow more and their investment

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:52.140
costs increase due to the growth

01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:54.420
of borrowing funds.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.240
Return to the previous slide.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.340
Even one slide back,

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:00.820
let's go.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.800
What else depends on the investment demand

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.400
of companies?

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:08.680
of national income.

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.720
How to understand?

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:10.840
Why so?

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.600
Imagine that the national income

01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:14.540
has increased.

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.880
All consumers' incomes have increased.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.300
They started spending more.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.380
So the demand for the products of the companies has increased.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.000
First, companies are trying

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:31.320
to meet this demand by means of

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.160
active production in capacities.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.700
But sooner or later, with the expansion

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:39.360
of demand, they will have to increase

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:41.340
their production capacity.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.580
That is, to buy new equipment,

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:45.460
to buy new buildings,

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:47.540
structures.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.960
That is, to make

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:50.760
investment costs.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.420
The higher the national income, the

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:56.900
higher the investment costs of the

01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:57.660
companies.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.480
Expected return on investment.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.760
The third factor.

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.300
He is also very important.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.840
Why do companies make

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:13.760
investment expenses?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.180
in terms of future profits.

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.660
And there are expectations of future

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:23.520
profits for firms favorable, they

01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:26.280
will invest more with other equal.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.180
Consequently, investment costs

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:31.760
are increasing.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.880
The overall demand is growing.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.500
By the way, these dependencies

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:45.720
are often used by the government

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.280
to conduct economic policy.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.040
Well, imagine the country's economy is

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:55.860
experiencing a decline or stagnation.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.780
This was relatively recently,

01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:59.540
for example, in Japan.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.360
Economic growth has fallen to almost

01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:04.280
zero.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.520
Or at some times, at some years, I

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:08.320
think it was even negative, there

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.420
was a decline in the Japanese

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:11.700
economy.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.780
What did the government and monetary authorities

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:16.820
of Japan try to do?

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.040
They tried to lower interest

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.100
rates.

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:25.620
Why Why?

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.420
To encourage consumers

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:30.840
and to spend more

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:31.740
money.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.880
Increase in demand for Japanese

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.820
products.

01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:41.880
This is to pull the real sector out

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:44.020
of the crisis.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.700
But for a long time it did not work very well.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:47.300
Why is?

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:52.380
Because even despite very low

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:54.960
interest rates, firms did not

01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:57.260
want to borrow money and invest.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.280
Their expectations for future

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:02.660
profits were unfavorable.

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.340
The psychological factor worked

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:05.580
against investment.

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:07.880
The same with households.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.780
Even with low interest rates,

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:13.980
they didn't have to spend much.

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:16.580
Because their personal expectations

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:18.160
of future income changes

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:20.520
were unfavorable.

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:24.420
Let us now talk about the third

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:28.080
component of the total demand.

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:29.780
Demand of the State.

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:34.250
The state is more difficult with demand.

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:35.810
Or vice versa is easier.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.930
The first two components of the aggregate

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:41.990
demand that we talked about

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.570
are household consumer expenses

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:47.010
and business investment

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.490
expenses, these are functions.

01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:54.650
That is, we can determine what

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:57.890
the household company costs

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.810
depend on.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:02.570
But nobody has ever managed to

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.350
build a function of public spending.

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.300
The public expenditure is largely

01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:13.700
arbitrarily determined

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:16.380
under the influence of

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:18.340
factors not economic,

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:21.480
but often political.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.900
Public spending is usually

01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:27.680
increasing before the election.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.940
But next year we have elections,

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:33.120
we can expect the government

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.020
to be scattered and the election

01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.280
will increase its spending

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:40.560
so that we can vote for those

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:42.180
we need to vote for.

01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:46.170
After the election, the government usually

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.770
starts saving.

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.730
And before the election, it doesn't really

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:54.490
consider money, it increases its expenses.

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:57.270
And that's why in macroeconomic

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.610
models, we read on the slide,

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:02.250
government spending is usually

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.970
present as an exogenous

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:07.730
or pre-determined parameter.

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:11.250
This parameter can be

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.010
changed.

01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:14.550
Up and down.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.060
The fourth component of total demand.

01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:25.510
Please look at the

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.310
next slide.

01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:31.930
Foreign demand or net exports?

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.820
In fact, I have said that net

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:38.280
exports are the difference

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:42.980
between exports and imports.

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.400
Foreigners buy our goods, it is

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.340
our exports.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.420
We buy foreign goods, it is

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.240
our import.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.960
Net export is the difference

01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:58.860
between export and import.

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:03.840
It is obvious that it can be negative.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.240
Imports exceed

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.240
exports.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.960
Well, as you probably know, we

01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:14.440
have in Russia net exports more

01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:16.340
than a positive value.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.880
Exports are much larger than imports.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.000
Of course, the structure of exports

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:27.620
and imports is not always satisfying.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.800
A significant portion of our exports

01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:32.660
is raw materials.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.420
Let us now talk about what factors

01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:40.220
net exports depend on.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.940
Please look at the slide.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.440
It depends on three main factors.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.480
The first factor is national income in

01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:55.900
other countries.

01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:01.910
Let's think about how it affects

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.010
our net exports.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:08.620
Well well well.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:09.840
Such an example.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.460
Imagine that our neighbors' economies

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:15.080
are experiencing a decline.

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:18.950
How will this affect our economy?

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.380
Obviously, our exports will fall.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.660
The poor are buying little.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.820
On the contrary, with the rise of economies in

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:37.940
neighbouring countries, their income will increase.

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.180
They will buy the most of all

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:42.540
goods, including ours, and our

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:44.520
exports will increase.

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.440
Accordingly, the greater the national

01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:48.780
income in other countries, the greater

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:51.580
our exports to these countries,

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.760
that is, our net exports.

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.550
It is I to the fact that we should

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.830
never be angry about the failures

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.650
in other countries of

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.830
economic failures.

01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:09.190
We are all in the same boat.

01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:12.550
And in the modern era

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.090
of globalization, if one economy

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.190
is sick, the big economy

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.090
is more likely to be sick for all

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.110
the other economies.

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:26.190
The United States is now developing

01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:28.810
at a fair pace, its

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.270
GDP is growing.

01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:35.030
Imagine what would happen if the

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.050
US economy were to go through a crisis.

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:41.470
This will hit the economies

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.270
of Europe and China first.

01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.870
Why is?

01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:48.010
Americans are the world's largest

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:48.970
consumer.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.560
National income in the United States will fall.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.520
Therefore, they will buy

01:17:55.530 --> 01:17:57.940
less foreign goods.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:02.000
Exports to the US will decrease

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.380
in other countries.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.800
The second factor.

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:13.910
National income in the country.

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.030
Here is such a paradox.

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:23.630
Our economy is growing.

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:25.870
We are becoming richer.

01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:32.190
And very often, the trade balance

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.250
or, in macroeconomic

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.070
language, the country's net

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.370
exports begin to deteriorate.

01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.650
Why is?

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:45.430
As our income grows, we

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.470
start to buy more of all

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.010
goods, including foreign ones.

01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:52.430
As our income grows, our

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.370
imports grow.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.760
Accordingly, net exports at the same

01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:01.740
level are beginning to decline

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:02.620
again.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.220
Our exports depend on

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:08.960
national income in other countries.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160
And our imports from

01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:12.500
our own national income.

01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:16.030
This is what we see in Russia.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:16.490


01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.640
The country's economy has been growing continuously since

01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:23.380
the 19th century.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.680
And at a fairly fast pace.

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:31.070
What do we see at the same time?

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.890
Imports are growing at a

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.230
very rapid rate.

01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:39.410
We are buying more

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:40.570
foreign goods.

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:43.390
And if the low, not very

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.950
favorable global climate in the

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.410
energy markets, it is possible

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.030
that our net exports would

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.090
be negative.

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.740
And the third factor.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.640
Very, in my opinion, very interesting.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.780
Factor of exchange rates.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.040
I would like to talk about him a

01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:10.900
little more detailed.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:12.740
Please look at the slide.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.840
First, the nominal exchange

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:19.480
rate is determined.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.100
Read the definition.

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:26.350
The nominal exchange rate is the price

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.670
of the national currency

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.910
expressed in foreign currency.

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:36.010
In particular, the nominal

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:40.130
rate of the ruble today

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:44.070
is let us count $1.25.

01:20:44.290 --> 01:20:46.430
Do not confuse the dollar.

01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:48.690
The rate is 25 rubles per dollar.

01:20:49.090 --> 01:20:52.190
The rate of the ruble is $1, 25.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.550
For the ruble, you get $ 1, 25.

01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:00.780
The real exchange rate is different.

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:04.160
This is the price ratio of goods in the

01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:05.920
two countries.

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.340
It is calculated by formula.

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.180
Look at this formula.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:16.800
The real exchange rate is equal

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:20.420
to the nominal exchange rate multiplied

01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:26.110
by the price of some goods in our

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.250
country and divided by the price

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:34.010
of similar goods abroad.

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:41.960
Let's find out this formula.

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:47.540
So let's write this formula again.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:52.080
The real exchange rate is equal

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:57.200
to the nominal exchange rate

01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:04.620
multiplied by the pH divided by the

01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:10.380
PF home price, foreign price.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:14.180
The price of the goods in our country and the

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:17.380
price of the similar goods in the foreign country.

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.720
Well, let us understand.

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.500
We agreed that the nominal

01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:30.900
exchange rate is 1,25

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.400
For the ruble, you get $ 1, 25.

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:54.210
Well, let's say that a product in

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.950
the US costs $100.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:23.560
A similar product in Russia costs

01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:32.020
1250 rubles.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:47.520
What is the real exchange rate?

01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:01.870
One and the second.

01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:07.310
What is the economic meaning

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.730
of the result?

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.660
Think of.

01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:32.770
We can multiply $100 by $25.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.420
What will we get as a result?

01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:44.710
As a result, we will get the price

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:48.530
of the American goods, expressed in rubles.

01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:51.410
That is, it will happen that

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.750
the American goods in rubles will

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.370
cost 2, 5 thousand rubles.

01:24:57.210 --> 01:25:01.950
The Russian goods cost 1250 rubles.

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.490
What comes from here?

01:25:04.770 --> 01:25:09.190
Russian goods are twice as cheap as American.

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.580
This is the real

01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:16.720
exchange rate.

01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:22.070
I remind you, please look again on the

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:24.230
slide that the real exchange rate

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.930
is the ratio of the prices of goods

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.930
in two countries.

01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:33.490
And here it turned out that under

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:36.130
this condition the price ratio

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.890
one-to-two or Russian goods are twice

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.450
as cheap as American.

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:46.040
But if our goods are twice as

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.780
cheap, how should it affect

01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:50.580
our exports and imports?

01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:54.960
Most likely, Americans will

01:25:59.150 --> 01:26:01.860
be willing to buy our goods,

01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:03.200
and we will not be willing

01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:06.160
to buy similar American goods.

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.860
This product will probably

01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:12.240
be exported.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:18.680
And if the real price for another

01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:20.320
commodity was, say, more than

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.900
one, what does that mean?

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:29.360
Is our product more expensive than the American analogue?

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.020
And so, with the other equals,

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:35.920
we will import this product.

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:41.070
But there are a lot of goods.

01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:44.010
Therefore, there will

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.190
also be a lot of real exchange

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.150
rates.

01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:53.310
For some goods, the real exchange rate is

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.310
less than one unit, for others more

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.690
than one unit.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.680
If the actual rate is less than one unit,

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:10.690
then we are more likely to export these goods.

01:27:11.190 --> 01:27:13.830
If the actual exchange rate is greater

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:16.870
than one unit, we will import these

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.130
goods more likely.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:28.460
But we are more interested in the

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:33.400
dynamics of this indicator over time.

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.680
Imagine that over time

01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:49.180
the real exchange

01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:54.340
rate is growing.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.680
This will mean that the conditions

01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:05.560
for our exports are worsening, and

01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:08.120
the conditions for our imports

01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:09.460
are improving.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.280
Per, to make it more clear,

01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:15.920
let's discuss our recent

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:17.700
Russian economic history

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:19.400
with you.

01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:25.810
In the early 90s of the last century.

01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:29.350
Exports from Russia are unstoppable.

01:28:30.670 --> 01:28:31.090
Why is?

01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:35.870
For most goods, the real exchange

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.550
rate is less than one unit.

01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:44.810
Our products are cheaper than foreign ones.

01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:47.630
We are profitable to export

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.810
these goods.

01:28:49.650 --> 01:28:51.390
It is not profitable to

01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:53.730
buy imported goods.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.460
What happened during the

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:01.000
90s?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.950
Well, if you remember, the nominal rate

01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:13.200
of the ruble against the dollar at that

01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:16.560
time was constantly falling.

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.260
And fell pretty quickly.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.600
Well, if anyone can remember, in the

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:35.150
early nineties, for a dollar was

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.530
given five rubles.

01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:40.430
And by the time of the domination, by the

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.650
end of the ninety-seventh year, the dollar

01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:47.130
was already more than five thousand rubles.

01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:51.690
The ruble rate against the dollar

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:52.730
has fallen.

01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:55.390
The dollar rose and the ruble fell.

01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:01.550
Well, let's assume that prices

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:05.750
abroad were roughly constant.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.270
Inflation abroad was low in those

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:09.490
years.

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:14.040
Let us assume that this variable

01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:16.680
was, it was to show was constant.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.080
What happened to prices in Russia?

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.240
Our prices have risen.

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:28.780
They grew quite quickly.

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.180
So we look.

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:38.440
This multiplier decreased, this

01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:39.640
multiplier rose.

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.480
What depends on the result?

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.880
It is obvious that this

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:52.740
indicator has increased

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:55.500
or decreased.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.880
In the 1990s, prices rose

01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:04.580
about twice as fast as

01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:07.040
the ruble fell.

01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:18.490
This means that the real rate of the ruble

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.590
has risen.

01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:25.050
In other words, our goods were

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:28.430
priced in relation to foreigners.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:34.300
This has had a negative impact on our exports.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:35.780
It is becoming increasingly difficult

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:37.220
for us to export our goods.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.580
But it has had a very good impact on

01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:42.180
our imports.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.780
We are increasingly

01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:48.060
importing foreign goods.

01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:56.180
Remember your life in the early 90s.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.220
What was in our houses?

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.920
Tempo and Rubin TVs, ZIL

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.740
refrigerators.

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:05.480
Where did we rest?

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.300
Probably on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus

01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:10.740
or in the suburb of Moscow.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.040
End of the 90s.

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:16.840
All in the homes of Sony, Panasonic, Deo.

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.750
We are increasingly travelling in foreign countries

01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:23.230
and resting in Turkey.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:29.360
So what does this say?

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.500
Our imports have grown at an accelerated

01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:37.360
rate compared to our exports.

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:39.740
And it was observed.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.100
I said that in the early 90s, exports

01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:44.560
were unstoppable.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.500
This is a huge gap between exports

01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:48.460
and imports.

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:53.160
By the year 1991, net exports

01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:54.260
were still positive.

01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:58.040
But the difference is minimal.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.180
What are we watching now?

01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:06.370
Not even not.

01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:07.970
Let us talk about this first.

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:13.890
What we saw after August

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.710
98?

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:20.740
I will rewrite the formula.

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.800
The ruble has fallen sharply.

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.760
His course fell almost three times

01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:46.680
in one, only a month.

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:49.780
The nominal rate of the ruble has fallen sharply.

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.900
Prices also increased.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.960
But in the first half of the year

01:33:56.970 --> 01:33:59.800
98 and in the beginning of the year

01:33:59.810 --> 01:34:03.800
99 prices grew more slowly

01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:07.340
than the ruble fell.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.720
And what did it lead to?

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:15.340
That the trend of change of the real

01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:18.380
course has changed to the opposite.

01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.400
The real course has fallen.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:24.800
Our products are again

01:34:24.810 --> 01:34:27.700
cheaper compared to foreign.

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:30.540
This makes it harder for

01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:32.180
us to sell our goods abroad.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.940
On the contrary, foreign goods in

01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:39.000
one night became too expensive for us.

01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:42.780
We look at our

01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:44.400
local producers.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:45.780
The local producers took

01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:47.560
the spirit.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.560
All the parking spaces are

01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:52.280
filled with unsold cars.

01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:55.740
And suddenly one night the foreigners traveled.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.220
And what led to what?

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.940
The car has temporarily solved

01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:00.460
its sales problems.

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:06.420
In other words, by reducing our imports, we

01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:08.600
increased our purchases of what?

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:11.940
Import of replacement products.

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.660
The demand for domestic

01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:17.760
goods has increased.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:20.560
But all - let's make it clear again, let's

01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:21.800
get the outcome.

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:31.140
The lower the real exchange rate,

01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:34.680
the cheaper our goods are in general

01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:36.740
relative to foreign.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.300
The more our exports and the

01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:42.700
less our imports.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.160
This means that our net exports are greater.

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.940
This is the result of the increased

01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:51.560
demand for Russian goods.

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.520
Yes, here is something else.

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:56.680
What are we watching now?

01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:01.440
The trend has changed drastically here.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.280
Not only do we have prices

01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:08.260
continue to rise, although at a

01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:09.720
more copper pace than before.

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.500
But what else is happening?

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.160
The nominal rate of the ruble,

01:36:17.170 --> 01:36:18.560
at least against the dollar,

01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:21.400
is now also rising.

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:28.000
The real course has grown.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.300
This generally has a negative

01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:37.720
impact on our exports and is

01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:39.720
very beneficial for our imports.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.800
We are again travelling in foreign brands,

01:36:43.810 --> 01:36:48.780
resting in Turkey, buying imported

01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:50.260
clothes again, for example.

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:52.820
Well, I hope you understand why

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:56.540
Americans are making claims

01:36:56.550 --> 01:37:00.920
to China about the Chinese

01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:07.510
being lowering the yuan.

01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:10.250
Why are the Chinese down the course?

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.880
This is the usual strategy

01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:17.000
of a developing economy

01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:18.860
–ining a low rate of national

01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:20.100
currency.

01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:20.460
Why is?

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.880
Because the low rate of the

01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:25.580
national currency promotes the export of

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.120
the country and, on the contrary,

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.680
makes it difficult to import foreign

01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:33.100
goods to this country.

01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:36.760
That is, the low rate is a

01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:39.840
factor in ensuring competitive advantages

01:37:39.850 --> 01:37:41.100
of the national developing

01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:43.460
economy.

01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:47.060
So, we have finished considering

01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:51.200
the combined demand curve.

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.640
But, if you think about it, the

01:37:53.650 --> 01:37:55.840
combined demand curve itself does

01:37:55.850 --> 01:38:00.380
not yet show what the price level

01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:03.840
and real GDP will be in the economy.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.760
It only says that the lower the

01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:10.120
price level, the greater the

01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:12.260
total demand for real GDP.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.980
But what will be the price of GDP,

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:18.200
only one cannot say anything.

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.160
The overall proposal function

01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:23.900
will be considered.

01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780
Please look at the

01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:27.080
next slide.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:31.360
Total supply is the real

01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:34.320
GDP that all producers

01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:37.920
are willing to produce and sell

01:38:37.930 --> 01:38:41.580
during a given time at different

01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:43.780
price levels.

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.020
Total demand is how much all

01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:51.040
consumers are willing to buy,

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.920
and total supply is how much

01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:56.300
all producers are willing to sell.

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.500
To analyze the function of aggregate

01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:07.100
supply, we will have to distinguish

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:10.000
short-term and long-term periods

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:12.060
in macroeconomics.

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:17.090
A long-term period in

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:20.530
macroeconomics is a period

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:24.050
during which prices of both commodities

01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:27.090
and resources can freely

01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:30.970
fluctuate up or down.

01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:34.870
Accordingly, the long-term curve

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.770
of the aggregate supply, please

01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:40.930
look at the slide, vertically

01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:42.790
at the level of the

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.650
potential GDP.

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.940
In other words, the behavior

01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:56.780
of the economy in the long term

01:39:56.790 --> 01:40:00.360
is determined by the classical model.

01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:05.190
According to the point of view of economists

01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:07.970
called the classics, the free market,

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:11.130
if not interfered, will sooner

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:15.370
or later result in the real

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:19.070
GDP becoming equal to the

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.750
potential level.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.320
What is potential GDP?

01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:29.670
The potential GDP is the GDP that is

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.130
attainable at the fullest possible extent

01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:36.330
with the full use of all available resources.

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:39.840
I want to emphasize again.

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:43.020
The classics emphasized, and

01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:45.060
this corresponds to the

01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:50.590
observed real, that a market economy

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.010
ultimately leads to, in the

01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.870
long run, that all available

01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:00.330
resources are used at full

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:02.130
capacity.

01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:05.850
The balance GDP is equal to

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.050
the potential level.

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:15.180
The potential GDP depends on the

01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:17.520
amount of resources available in

01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:20.660
the economy and on technical progress.

01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:25.170
But the potential GDP or economic

01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:28.590
opportunities are not dependent

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:29.810
on the level of prices.

01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:33.150
Prices can be higher and lower.

01:41:34.290 --> 01:41:37.870
And again, the economy sooner

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:40.850
or later comes to

01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:44.190
potential GDP at higher or lower

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.890
prices.

01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:49.390
This means that the long-

01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.730
term summary proposition

01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:54.570
curve is a vertical line,

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:58.690
as shown in the picture

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:00.410
you see on the slide.

01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:04.730
The long-term function of the aggregate

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.430
offer can shift to the right

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.930
or to the left.

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.040
Imagine that the amount of resources

01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:15.840
available in this economy

01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:18.400
has increased over time.

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.740
Well, for example, the population increased,

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.890
capital accumulated.

01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:30.430
Under capital, I want to emphasize

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.410
again, we understand in macroeconomics

01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.570
the means of production.

01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:38.190
In the economy more machines, machines, equipment.

01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:41.010
Finally, there is technical progress.

01:42:41.150 --> 01:42:45.490
This means that the potential GDP

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.610
is increasing.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.620
And if that is the case, the long-

01:42:53.630 --> 01:42:55.480
term summary supply curve begins

01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:58.280
to shift to the right.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.300
If, on the contrary, there is a regression

01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:02.820
in the economy, the amount of resources

01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:04.820
is reduced.

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:07.600
Instead of technological progress,

01:43:07.610 --> 01:43:10.140
the regression is technical.

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:12.820
In this, quite rare case, the long-

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:16.400
term function of the aggregate

01:43:16.410 --> 01:43:19.500
offer shifts to the left.

01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:22.720
Now let's talk about the

01:43:22.730 --> 01:43:25.800
short-term function of the aggregate offer.

01:43:28.730 --> 01:43:33.510
In the short term, prices for goods and

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.250
resources are less flexible than in the long term.

01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:41.470
Moreover, sometimes they

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:44.010
are unchanged.

01:43:51.630 --> 01:43:53.630
Accordingly, the short-term

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:55.570
curve of the aggregate supply

01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:58.110
can be horizontal or have

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:00.290
a rising slope.

01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:02.270
A positive trend.

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:04.310
Please look at the slide.

01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:09.720
What does the left schedule say?

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:13.700
That the level of prices in the economy is

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.540
set, and producers have the opportunity

01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:23.020
to increase the volume of real GDP at a

01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:24.180
given level of prices.

01:44:24.190 --> 01:44:27.540
There would be demand for their products.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.960
Usually, such a function,

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:33.540
the horizontal function of the aggregate

01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.770
supply, occurs when the actual

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:40.930
GDP is significantly less

01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:43.290
than the potential.

01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:46.070
The economy is working with

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.730
a great underload.

01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:50.750
There are a lot of unused

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.270
resources.

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:56.190
Figuratively speaking, mass unemployment

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.770
in the economy, factories are

01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:01.570
stagnant, fields are not sowed.

01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:03.230
Why does this happen?

01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:07.350
Probably because of the low

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.090
overall demand for

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:11.350
domestic products.

01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:15.270
If the overall demand increased,

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.610
it would be not difficult for manufacturers

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:20.590
to engage today's unemployed in

01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:24.440
production, increase the use of

01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:26.820
equipment, that is, without

01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:28.960
raising prices.

01:45:30.630 --> 01:45:33.350
That is, at the same price level,

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.530
producers could freely increase the

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.510
volume of production.

01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:40.090
And the short-term curve of the

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:43.790
aggregate offer is, it turns out, horizontal.

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:48.140
Another case is more frequent.

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:51.320
Look at the right chart when

01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:53.580
the short-term aggregate

01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:56.640
bid curve has a positive tilt.

01:45:58.260 --> 01:45:59.460
What does this mean?

01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:03.360
That in a short period, producers

01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:09.260
respond to the rise in prices by the

01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.340
growth of real GDP, the growth

01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:15.220
of real production.

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.920
That means higher prices

01:46:18.930 --> 01:46:21.560
are encouraging producers

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:26.360
to produce and sell more products.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.340
The real GDP, i.e.

01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:32.300
the total supply from

01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:34.800
all producers, is growing.

01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:42.050
Remember, I said that the

01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:43.710
long-term aggregate proposition function

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:46.050
can shift to the right, sometimes

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.490
to the left.

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:52.190
The short-term function of the aggregate

01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.750
offer may shift downward, but more

01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:56.770
often all upwards.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.020
Why can this happen?

01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:09.760
In fact, the short-term function

01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:12.080
of the aggregate supply is related

01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:15.680
to the cost of the producers per

01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:17.840
unit of product.

01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:21.540
Imagine that the resources have been

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:29.000
spent by all the companies.

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:31.320
What will this lead to?

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:37.060
That all companies will be forced

01:47:38.690 --> 01:47:41.680
to raise their sales prices when producing

01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:44.760
the previous volume of products.

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.740
Accordingly, the short-term curve

01:47:46.750 --> 01:47:48.520
of the aggregate proposition, though

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.240
horizontal, though rising,

01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:52.400
shifts to the right.

01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:56.120
The simplest example.

01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:59.380
Imagine that the RAU of the EU

01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:01.960
has increased electricity tariffs.

01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:06.410
What will this lead to?

01:48:08.050 --> 01:48:11.050
All companies will have increased

01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:14.950
costs on equal terms.

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.520
This means that they will have to increase

01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:24.420
their prices at previous volume

01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:25.860
of production.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:27.780
And the short-term curve

01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:30.400
of the total supply will go,

01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:31.620
I repeat, up.

01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:38.110
Now to the third question of the topic.

01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:43.940
macroeconomic balance of the economy.

01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:49.460
What is it?

01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:54.770
Macroeconomic balance is

01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:57.450
achieved when the total

01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:02.150
demand is equal to the total supply.

01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:07.480
Please look at the slide.

01:49:15.010 --> 01:49:18.170
I have said that in the long run,

01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:21.610
the total supply is aimed at

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:24.870
the level of the potential GDP.

01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:31.510
Accordingly, macroeconomic balance

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.270
is achieved at the point of intersection

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:36.730
of the combined demand curve

01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:40.070
and the long-term combined

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.210
supply curve.

01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:48.190
What happens if the overall demand increases?

01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:51.290
For example, the central bank will increase

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.830
the money mass in the economy.

01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:57.220
Total demand will grow, but

01:49:57.230 --> 01:49:59.840
in the long run it will only affect

01:49:59.850 --> 01:50:01.740
prices.

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.660
The output will remain the same

01:50:04.670 --> 01:50:07.460
and equal to the potential GDP.

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.980
Well, the short-term curve of the

01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:16.940
aggregate offer, it does not play

01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:18.600
an independent role here.

01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:21.900
It simply goes through the point

01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:24.740
of long-term macroeconomic equilibrium.

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.420
It is as if it is adjusted to the intersection

01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:31.820
of these two functions.

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.080
The function of aggregate

01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:37.020
demand and long-term supply curve.

01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:42.730
In the short term, the situation is more complicated.

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:49.160
Please look at the slide.

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.180
Macroeconomic balance is at the

01:50:52.190 --> 01:50:55.720
point of intersection of the curve

01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:59.670
of aggregate demand and the

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.010
short-term curve of aggregate supply.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:07.760
At the same time, the balanced

01:51:07.770 --> 01:51:09.260
GDP may not coincide

01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:11.260
with the potential, as

01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:13.460
we see in the slide chart.

01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:16.910
Please look at.

01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:20.610
Balance GDP is defined by

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.350
the intersection of the

01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:26.150
short-term supply and the combined

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:28.630
demand function.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.150
At the same time, the balanced GDP is

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:35.130
less than the potential, that is, the

01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:37.370
economy is underloaded.

01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:39.270
Why underload?

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:41.980
Small total demand.

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.120
If it were more, imagine,

01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:48.140
well, that the state could

01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:51.560
stimulate the overall demand

01:51:51.570 --> 01:51:53.260
with its methods.

01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:56.400
Whatever his mind, imagine.

01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.160
Total demand would increase and the

01:52:00.170 --> 01:52:01.760
combined demand curve would

01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:03.480
shift to the right.

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.220
And it is possible that in this

01:52:05.230 --> 01:52:09.060
case the balanced GDP would be the same

01:52:09.070 --> 01:52:10.700
as the potential.

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:14.580
Here let's take this moment

01:52:14.590 --> 01:52:17.840
and look at it more carefully.

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:20.220
Next slide, please see

01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:23.220
the change in the balance

01:52:23.230 --> 01:52:24.820
of the economy.

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:28.460
Let us understand.

01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:29.920
It only at first glance looks

01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:31.800
like such a confusing picture.

01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:33.500
There is really nothing complicated

01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:34.200
in it.

01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:38.420
See also vertical function.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.120
Long-term function of the aggregate offer.

01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:46.640
It goes vertically from point U1.

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.480
So what is U1?

01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.580
The potential GDP.

01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:00.580
Short-term function of the aggregate offer.

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:06.020
SRAs0

01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:12.480
The total demand function AD0.

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:15.660
The macroeconomic balance is

01:53:15.670 --> 01:53:18.360
achieved at the point G0.

01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.000
Again, what are we watching?

01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:23.700
The overall demand is small.

01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:28.280
GDP is less than the

01:53:28.290 --> 01:53:29.860
potential level.

01:53:31.450 --> 01:53:35.570
Suppose the overall demand has

01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:37.370
increased for some reason.

01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:39.490
The state has tried to stimulate

01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:40.790
the overall demand.

01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:42.490
Maybe something else happened.

01:53:43.330 --> 01:53:44.890
But overall demand has increased.

01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:49.370
Accordingly, the AD curve, the aggregate

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:51.970
demand curve is shifting to where?

01:53:53.050 --> 01:53:53.770
to the right.

01:53:55.170 --> 01:53:56.670
Where is the cross now?

01:53:58.030 --> 01:54:00.150
At the E1.

01:54:00.690 --> 01:54:03.290
We have increased prices, the level of prices has risen.

01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:08.470
But the balanced GDP is now equal to the potential.

01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:10.170
The policy of stimulating

01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:12.430
overall demand has yielded its fruits.

01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:15.290
Total demand has increased, and the balanced

01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:16.470
GDP has also increased.

01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:23.170
What if the overall demand

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:24.770
increases?

01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:28.870
The AD curve will then move further to the

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:31.610
right, already in the position of AD2.

01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:36.260
In the short term, the point

01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:39.980
of balance will be E2.

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.220
Well, the point of intersection

01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:44.640
between the short-term curve of aggregate

01:54:44.650 --> 01:54:46.520
supply and the new curve of

01:54:46.530 --> 01:54:48.380
aggregate demand.

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.720
But what are we watching now?

01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.760
We are seeing a warming economy.

01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:59.680
The economy is overloaded.

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:04.780
GDP is higher than

01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:06.680
potential.

01:55:06.690 --> 01:55:08.560
In a short period of time, this is possible.

01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:12.780
This means not the normal, but

01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:14.760
the superintensive use of all

01:55:14.770 --> 01:55:16.180
resources.

01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.020
For example, a normal working day,

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:24.540
8 hours with a 5-day working week.

01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.620
But in a short period, people can

01:55:27.630 --> 01:55:29.420
work 10 hours, 10 hours without

01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:30.160
weekends.

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.240
We say that the labor resources

01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:35.700
are being used superintensively.

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:39.540
Some equipment is stopped

01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:42.060
for prevention periodically.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.120
But you can allow a situation in

01:55:45.130 --> 01:55:46.760
which the equipment for

01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:50.160
prevention is not stopped in a short period of time.

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:51.120
and so on.

01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:55.420
This is why we have learned that the economy

01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:57.460
is overloaded with resources.

01:55:57.470 --> 01:56:00.860
I repeat, it is used superintensively.

01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:03.260
GDP is more than potential.

01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:07.700
But when the resource is used

01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:11.040
superintensively, they become deficitary.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.780
The prices for them are beginning to rise.

01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:22.230
This leads to the fact that the costs of the

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.450
companies are beginning to increase.

01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:27.330
And when the costs of the companies

01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:29.650
per unit of product begin to increase,

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:32.430
the short-term function of the aggregate

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:35.530
supply goes up.

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:40.030
This is where it moved to S R

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:41.710
A S 1.

01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:46.060
Where do we end up in the end?

01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:49.740
Eventually, the balance returns

01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:53.260
to the E3 point.

01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:55.360
That is, the economy eventually

01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:56.960
returns to potential

01:56:56.970 --> 01:57:00.480
GDP, but at the highest

01:57:00.490 --> 01:57:02.500
possible price level.

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.600
P3 in my example.

01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:11.610
Let us go to the fourth question.

01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:21.650
The fourth question is called the multiplier effect.

01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:27.150
Look at the interesting

01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:31.110
macroeconomic patterns.

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:38.180
Suppose, with a given level of

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.530
national income, one of the

01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:46.170
economic agents increases its

01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:48.950
expenses.

01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:52.770
Well, let's say household incomes

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:56.110
have not changed, but they have

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:57.790
decided to spend more for

01:57:57.800 --> 01:57:58.890
some reason.

01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:03.590
Or the revenues of the firms remained

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:05.930
the same, but they believe

01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:08.270
the business prospects are favorable

01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.790
and decided to increase investment

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:14.250
costs with their current revenues,

01:58:14.410 --> 01:58:16.490
to purchase new equipment.

01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:19.930
The state has decided to increase

01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:21.210
its expenses.

01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:24.790
Or foreigners, with other equals, decided

01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:28.730
to increase the purchase of our goods.

01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:35.170
This means that so-called autonomous

01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:38.150
costs have increased.

01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:43.070
Autonomous expenses are expenses

01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:45.390
that are made with a constant

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.430
income.

01:58:47.670 --> 01:58:51.390
If your income has not changed, but you

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:54.290
have increased your expenses, it

01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:57.470
means that your own expenses have increased.

01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:59.730
If the company's income did not change, they

01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:02.270
increased their expenses.

01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:04.230
This means that the companies have carried

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:05.830
out autonomous expenses.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:09.140
Expenditure on previous income.

01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:18.810
Imagine this situation.

01:59:19.770 --> 01:59:23.110
The companies increased

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:26.310
their investment costs by some amount.

01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:31.890
Conditionally for 100 rubles.

01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:35.390
But that is interesting.

01:59:42.410 --> 01:59:45.450
Very soon we will see that

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:49.010
the combined demand and national

01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:54.350
income, and real GDP, will increase

01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:57.410
by a greater amount compared to

01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:59.490
the initial change in autonomous

02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:01.390
spending.

02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:06.110
Conditionally, you have increased your expenses

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:09.210
by 100 rubles, and then the economy

02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:11.830
will go through a chain reaction, which

02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:15.650
will lead to the fact that the overall

02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:17.550
demand of all consumers will increase

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.650
not by 100 rubles, but by a larger amount.

02:00:21.110 --> 02:00:25.430
This is what the multiplier effect is.

02:00:26.490 --> 02:00:29.630
Please read the definition on the

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:30.750
slide.

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:33.750
The multiplier of autonomous expenses

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.350
is a factor that shows how much

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.170
rubles the combined demand

02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:42.750
and national income change

02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:46.170
when autonomous expenses change

02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:49.050
by one ruble.

02:00:49.610 --> 02:00:52.350
Well, that is, if, say, the firms increased

02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:53.790
their expenses by 100 rubles, and

02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:58.910
the demand is ultimately aggregate,

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.610
this means that each ruble of autonomous

02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:07.970
expenses led to an increase in the

02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:10.550
aggregate demand and GDP by 5

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:12.570
rubles.

02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:16.010
The multiplier is equal to 5.

02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:22.110
So, I'll try to illustrate the effect

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.510
of the multiplier of autonomous costs

02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:28.410
on a simple numerical example.

02:01:30.210 --> 02:01:31.290
Well here, look at it.

02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:36.530
Companies have increased their autonomous

02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:38.930
expenses.

02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:41.970
That is, the expenses of this income.

02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:44.170
The national income did not change, but

02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:46.590
the companies increased their expenses

02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:48.730
with this income.

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.470
For 100 rubles.

02:01:51.330 --> 02:01:54.550
What does it mean that companies have increased their expenses?

02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:57.910
This means that they, for example,

02:01:58.590 --> 02:02:01.870
ordered new equipment

02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:04.630
for 100 rubles.

02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:09.390
The money is spent, the equipment is delivered.

02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:19.090
So, the combined demand and national

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:23.170
income increased at the beginning

02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.590
by 100 rubles.

02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:28.930
Here it is assumed that the

02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:31.230
short-term function of the aggregate

02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:33.110
offer is horizontal.

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:37.650
The growth of production is equal to the

02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:39.390
growth of the total...

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:42.690
Increase in total demand.

02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:48.450
The total demand increased by 100 rubles.

02:02:49.810 --> 02:02:52.430
In response to the increase in demand for

02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.210
100 rubles, the workers of the machinery manufacturers

02:02:57.220 --> 02:03:01.830
produced and sold machines for this amount.

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.840
So, these 100 rubles

02:03:09.850 --> 02:03:12.320
the engineers received

02:03:12.330 --> 02:03:14.700
as their income.

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.800
For customers, the cost is 100 rubles.

02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:23.020
But this cost turned into the income

02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:25.900
of those who produced the equipment.

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.320
What did the workers do?

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.200
Well, suppose, having received

02:03:35.210 --> 02:03:38.580
an additional income of 100 rubles,

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.460
the engineers spent part of that

02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:49.380
income, and saved the other part.

02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:52.880
In this simple model, we do not consider taxes.

02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:56.200
All additional income

02:03:56.210 --> 02:03:58.480
is divided into additional

02:03:58.490 --> 02:04:01.640
consumption and additional savings.

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.280
The increase in consumer spending

02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:14.100
with the increase in national income

02:04:14.110 --> 02:04:16.800
per ruble is called the

02:04:16.810 --> 02:04:21.060
limit tendency to consumption.

02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:34.170
The limit tendency to consumption

02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:38.070
is equal to the increase in

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:42.090
consumer expenses divided by the

02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:45.250
increase in income.

02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:50.530
Or it also shows how much of

02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:55.450
their additional income people consume.

02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:59.370
Well, let us suppose that the

02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:01.230
limit inclination to consumption

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:04.830
is equal to one second delta

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:11.250
C on the delta Y let one second.

02:05:13.190 --> 02:05:16.470
So, having received an additional

02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:19.610
income of 100 rubles, the

02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:25.030
engineers saved 50 rubles and

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.590
spent 50 rubles.

02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:31.610
What consumer benefits

02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.750
they need.

02:05:39.250 --> 02:05:40.810
The limit of consumption

02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:42.090
is one second.

02:05:42.370 --> 02:05:43.350
Half of the extra income is

02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:45.490
spent, half is saved.

02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:49.150
So 50 rubles workers of

02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:50.970
machinery builders spent

02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:53.370
on consumer goods.

02:05:56.210 --> 02:06:01.060
For example, food industry products.

02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:02.720
What did it lead to?

02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:10.720
The demand increased by 50 rubles.

02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:19.630
In other words, the additional

02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.930
expenses of the working machine makers

02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:25.790
have turned into additional

02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:30.650
income of the food industry workers.

02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:34.230
What did the workers do with their income?

02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:35.670
I got another 50 rubles.

02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:39.230
We assume that the ultimate tendency

02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:40.690
to consume is the same for

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:43.070
all, one second.

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:47.550
So, of these 50 rubles of

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:50.610
additional income they saved

02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:54.590
25 rubles, and spent another

02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:56.930
25, another 25 rubles.

02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:01.470
So, how much has the overall

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.910
demand increased?

02:07:04.130 --> 02:07:06.150
25 rubles more.

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.980
Who got those 25 rubles?

02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:18.800
Employees of those industries

02:07:18.810 --> 02:07:21.420
on the products of which the swimmers

02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:24.560
spent their additional income.

02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:28.140
Food industry workers.

02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:30.280
Workers of the food industry.

02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:36.520
What did the employees who received

02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:37.900
this income 25 rubles?

02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:41.220
Half of what we agreed,

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:45.100
saved, half spent.

02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:48.120
So how much did the combined

02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:50.000
demand and national income increase?

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:56.380
Another 12,5 rubles.

02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:59.290
and so on.

02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:05.260
So we have a chain.

02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:10.600
Expenditures are converted into income.

02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:16.730
Revenue is transformed into new expenses.

02:08:18.710 --> 02:08:22.170
And in the end we have a decreasing

02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.650
geometric progression

02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:27.050
here, plus multi-pointness, plus zero

02:08:27.390 --> 02:08:31.730
and equal will be two hundred.

02:08:34.570 --> 02:08:37.250
So, the initial demand momentum

02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:41.210
of 100 rubles resulted

02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:44.690
in a total demand and

02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:46.470
national income

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:52.560
growth of 200 rubles.

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:56.020
The multiplier of

02:08:56.030 --> 02:09:00.200
autonomous costs is equal

02:09:00.210 --> 02:09:01.100
to two.

02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:04.560
Look at the top formula.

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:06.720
Multiplier is equal to what?

02:09:09.650 --> 02:09:13.650
Delta Y is divided into Delta A.

02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:18.260
Delta A is the initial change

02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:20.840
of autonomous expenses.

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.380
As I said, it is 100 rubles.

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:29.920
In the end, the total demand

02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:31.080
and national income increased

02:09:31.090 --> 02:09:32.860
by 200 rubles.

02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:34.880
So the multiplier in our example

02:09:34.890 --> 02:09:37.040
is equal to two.

02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:44.850
The multiplier can be calculated by the formula.

02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:47.850
Please look at the slide.

02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:50.270
Multiplier is equal to the unit

02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:52.450
divided by the unit, minus

02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:55.250
the limit inclination to consumption.

02:09:55.330 --> 02:09:57.010
The limit inclination to consumption

02:09:57.020 --> 02:09:58.430
in my example, as I have already

02:09:58.440 --> 02:09:59.710
told you, is equal to what?

02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:01.130
One second one.

02:10:03.070 --> 02:10:04.390
One minus one second, one second

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:06.150
in the denominator, one divided

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:07.250
by one second, it turned

02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:09.270
out to be two.

02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:15.120
Well, knowing the multiplier, what

02:10:15.130 --> 02:10:16.460
are we?

02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:19.640
Can we multiply it by

02:10:19.650 --> 02:10:21.440
the initial increase in autonomous

02:10:21.450 --> 02:10:23.700
costs and get what?

02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:27.920
The final increase in national

02:10:27.930 --> 02:10:29.580
income and gross domestic

02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:32.720
product.

02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.980
Now, let's go to the last,

02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:41.920
fifth, question of this topic.

02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:46.660
Problems of the Russian economy.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:49.540
Please look at the table

02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:53.520
shown on the next slide.

02:10:55.590 --> 02:10:58.930
We have years in the first line.

02:10:59.170 --> 02:11:01.610
from 92 to 2006.

02:11:02.490 --> 02:11:05.990
The second is real

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.390
GDP.

02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:11.200
How is considered?

02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.580
The real GDP is calculated as a percentage

02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:17.040
of the previous year.

02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:20.580
The previous year is considered

02:11:20.590 --> 02:11:21.080
100.

02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:26.040
Please see what we are watching.

02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:28.260
It is 92 years.

02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.680
What is the real GDP of 55,8?

02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:40.440
This means that we took the GDP of

02:11:40.450 --> 02:11:41.640
91 years for 100.

02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:48.850
In 92 GDP was 85.5 percent

02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:50.270
of 100.

02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:54.210
In one year, Russia's GDP fell

02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:57.530
by 14.5 percent.

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.440
93 years.

02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:02.500
What can I say about him?

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:06.940
What do the numbers 91 and 3 mean?

02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.900
We have been taking for 100 for 92 years.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:19.140
The numbers 91 and 3 mean that in

02:12:19.150 --> 02:12:23.880
93 the GDP fell by 8.7% compared

02:12:23.890 --> 02:12:29.620
to 92 years ago.

02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:30.640
and so on.

02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:32.160
94 years.

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:34.040
What are we watching now?

02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.540
The decline has intensified.

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:42.520
Compared to the 93 year, which

02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:45.780
we now take for 100, the 94

02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:50.940
year was 87.3 percent.

02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:54.900
That is, GDP fell by 12.7 percent

02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:58.640
in one year.

02:12:58.760 --> 02:12:59.500
and so on.

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:03.640
We see that GDP has fallen up to 97

02:13:03.650 --> 02:13:06.040
years.

02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:13.020
In 1997, GDP was 100,9 compared

02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:16.640
to 96 years ago.

02:13:16.650 --> 02:13:21.380
So GDP increased by almost

02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:24.300
1% in 97 compared to 96.

02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:28.160
98 again falls.

02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:32.140
The economic growth began in the 99s.

02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:35.960
I will not talk here about the reasons

02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:39.400
for the decline in the 90s.

02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:43.540
From 92 to 98.

02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:45.720
This is a normal situation,

02:13:45.730 --> 02:13:48.460
called a transformational decline.

02:13:48.860 --> 02:13:51.340
It was survived by all the economies

02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:54.280
that had moved from the Soviet

02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:56.860
administrative-command system to

02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:58.440
the market system.

02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.140
It is more interesting to see

02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:08.370
why the Russian economy

02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:12.330
has been growing since the 99s.

02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:17.260
Let us remember what happened

02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:24.140
in 98 in August 98 in the

02:14:27.850 --> 02:14:30.680
financial crisis.

02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:32.200
What did he lead to?

02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:38.740
A sharp fall in the ruble.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.040
I have already that somewhere in one

02:14:43.050 --> 02:14:45.980
month the ruble fell, the nominal rate

02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:48.440
of the ruble fell almost three times.

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.240
So the nominal rate of the ruble

02:14:56.490 --> 02:15:00.500
fell, the real rate of the ruble fell,

02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:03.720
and this led to the fact that our net

02:15:03.730 --> 02:15:05.000
exports grew.

02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:08.300
Well, remember, I said that when

02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:11.340
the real rate drops, our

02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:14.980
goods become cheaper, cheaper,

02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:19.280
cheaper relative to foreign.

02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:25.320
So, it is easier for us to export

02:15:25.330 --> 02:15:28.100
our goods, and it is harder

02:15:28.110 --> 02:15:30.600
for foreigners to import their

02:15:30.610 --> 02:15:32.640
goods to our country.

02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:34.920
Foreign goods are getting

02:15:34.930 --> 02:15:39.360
too expensive for us.

02:15:41.850 --> 02:15:43.710
But if foreign goods become

02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:45.750
too expensive, we increase

02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:49.330
demand for domestic import

02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:51.750
substitute products.

02:15:56.130 --> 02:15:59.370
So our net exports are growing.

02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:04.110
It is a component of overall demand.

02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:06.590
Let me try to explain it, maybe

02:16:06.650 --> 02:16:08.330
more clearly.

02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:12.250
Let us once again remember together

02:16:13.050 --> 02:16:16.370
which components are divided into

02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:17.630
the total demand.

02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:33.820
The four components.

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:36.640
Consumer demand of households,

02:16:36.650 --> 02:16:39.500
investment demand of firms,

02:16:39.510 --> 02:16:43.700
demand of the state and demand

02:16:43.710 --> 02:16:47.180
of foreigners, called net exports.

02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:50.460
Net exports are the difference

02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:54.460
between our exports

02:16:54.470 --> 02:16:57.200
and imports.

02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:08.480
X exports and M imports.

02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:12.060
What happened in the

02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:15.560
August 98 crisis?

02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:19.500
Again, the ruble has fallen.

02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:22.680
The nominal rate of the ruble fell, and the

02:17:22.690 --> 02:17:24.200
real rate also fell.

02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:28.180
So our goods have been cheaper

02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:30.740
compared to foreign goods, or the same

02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:33.380
thing, foreign goods have been

02:17:33.390 --> 02:17:35.240
higher compared to our own.

02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:43.420
This makes it easier for

02:17:43.430 --> 02:17:45.040
us to export our products.

02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:48.980
Our exports have grown.

02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:53.680
On the other hand, the competitiveness

02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:55.740
of our products in relation to

02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:59.560
foreign products has increased.

02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:03.760
Foreign goods are relatively expensive.

02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:08.020
So imports have decreased.

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:13.860
But with the decrease of imports, imports have decreased.

02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.320
This means that we have turned

02:18:17.330 --> 02:18:19.720
our eyes on domestic

02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:21.320
import substitute products.

02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:23.260
We have increased our demand for it.

02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:27.540
Thus, as a result of the increase

02:18:27.550 --> 02:18:31.880
in exports and the fall in imports,

02:18:31.890 --> 02:18:33.660
our net exports grew.

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:37.240
This is a component of the overall

02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:41.840
demand for our products.

02:18:45.570 --> 02:18:49.010
The overall demand has increased.

02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:51.770
And when the overall demand increases,

02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:55.370
what do we see on the schedule?

02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:01.350
Please see the following slide.

02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:07.790
Total demand increased due

02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:09.250
to net exports.

02:19:09.670 --> 02:19:12.810
And the curve of hell is moving where?

02:19:13.930 --> 02:19:16.790
Right to AD1.

02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:21.130
What did it lead to?

02:19:21.490 --> 02:19:22.930
Prices have risen.

02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:26.030
The price level has risen from P0 to P1.

02:19:26.610 --> 02:19:28.110
But more important than another.

02:19:28.510 --> 02:19:30.770
GDP is balanced.

02:19:31.050 --> 02:19:33.230
From Y0 to Y1.

02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:37.450
So there was economic growth.

02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:41.990
Back to the table.

02:19:42.610 --> 02:19:47.950
Here we see that in 99 years, the effect

02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:52.690
of the devaluation of the ruble

02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:56.110
increased our real GDP.

02:19:56.930 --> 02:19:58.470
As they say, there would be no happiness,

02:19:58.510 --> 02:19:59.850
but misfortune helped.

02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:04.730
The financial crisis, despite all its unpleasant

02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:07.990
consequences, has led to the fact that

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.110
Russia's GDP has started to grow.

02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:15.110
This is due, again, to the growth

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:18.170
of the overall demand for our products.

02:20:18.570 --> 02:20:20.730
Many companies that previously lie

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:23.130
in Baku suddenly found that demand

02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:26.190
for their products grew.

02:20:28.570 --> 02:20:32.010
Again, I repeat, the curve of AD has

02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:37.440
shifted to the right and the balanced

02:20:37.450 --> 02:20:39.160
GDP has grown.

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:47.440
In the second half of 1999 the

02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:53.520
growth of GDP continued.

02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:55.080
Look at the table.

02:20:55.720 --> 02:21:01.780
In 2000, GDP grew by 10% compared

02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:02.720
to 1999.

02:21:03.180 --> 02:21:04.880
Remember, we take

02:21:04.890 --> 02:21:06.480
100 each year.

02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:15.220
Now the multiplier effect works.

02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:21.560
Remember I just explained it?

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:22.820
The multiplier effect.

02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:24.760
What is he expressing?

02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:25.980
Let's, in this case.

02:21:28.420 --> 02:21:31.700
Our net exports have increased.

02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:35.640
Our companies have found that there

02:21:35.650 --> 02:21:37.840
is a demand for their products.

02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:40.900
But if demand for their products

02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:44.120
grew, and they began to produce more

02:21:44.130 --> 02:21:46.340
products, the incomes of those

02:21:46.350 --> 02:21:48.780
who produce these products increased

02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:50.980
accordingly.

02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:53.600
Income increased, what increased?

02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:55.160
their expenses.

02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:58.100
Remember the multiplier effect?

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.020
Growth in expenses causes growth in

02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:03.340
income, growth in income causes growth

02:22:03.350 --> 02:22:05.100
in expenses.

02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:06.860
New growth of expenses.

02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:09.840
So what have we started to observe?

02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:13.680
Due to the increase in incomes, consumer

02:22:13.690 --> 02:22:15.860
expenses have increased.

02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:19.820
The companies have seen the demand for their products

02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:20.620
increase.

02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:23.280
What will this demand say?

02:22:23.290 --> 02:22:26.220
They began to expand, buy

02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:27.400
new equipment, that is,

02:22:27.410 --> 02:22:32.260
to make investment expenses.

02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:34.020
So what component has increased

02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:35.820
the overall demand?

02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:38.240
The Investment.

02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:43.640
So the overall demand has increased even more.

02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:48.300
And the curve of the total demand,

02:22:48.310 --> 02:22:54.080
see the next slide, it shifted even

02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:56.700
more from the position of AD1,

02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:59.460
on the previous slide we had

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:01.800
AD1, already in the position

02:23:01.810 --> 02:23:03.880
of AD2.

02:23:07.820 --> 02:23:09.940
And what have we come to?

02:23:12.900 --> 02:23:17.240
We have come to the fact that the balanced

02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:22.620
GDP has reached the potential level.

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.440
Look again.

02:23:24.860 --> 02:23:27.620
Function of total demand.

02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:30.580
She is constantly moving to the right.

02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:32.900
It has adopted the AD2.

02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:37.360
And now it crosses the

02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:39.560
long-term curve of total supply

02:23:39.570 --> 02:23:43.860
at point E2.

02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:47.460
This means that the balanced GDP

02:23:47.470 --> 02:23:49.840
has reached a potential level.

02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:53.440
Let us go back to the table again.

02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:59.020
Look at 90...

02:23:59.030 --> 02:24:01.080
by 2002.

02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:06.820
At the end of the year, economists

02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:08.700
were very pessimistic.

02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:11.960
They said the growth was out.

02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:19.780
In 2000, GDP grew by 10%.

02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:25.340
In 2001, GDP grew by 5.1%.

02:24:25.350 --> 02:24:31.400
In 2002, it increased by 4.7%.

02:24:31.410 --> 02:24:34.880
Economists have predicted that

02:24:34.890 --> 02:24:36.900
growth will soon stop.

02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:39.400
From what did they come?

02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:43.100
They assumed that the balanced

02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:45.980
GDP had already reached

02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:47.560
the potential level.

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:50.520
And I explained that when

02:24:50.530 --> 02:24:52.980
the balanced GDP reaches a

02:24:52.990 --> 02:24:56.080
potential level, further growth in

02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:59.280
the aggregate demand leads only

02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:02.980
to growth in production only in

02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:04.620
a short period of time.

02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:06.780
In the long run, as the economy

02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:08.080
is overloaded, prices start

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:10.940
to rise and the economy

02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:12.280
returns to potential

02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:14.460
GDP only at higher

02:25:14.470 --> 02:25:15.600
price levels.

02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:25.200
The year 2003 was a pessimistic year.

02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:29.120
Look what happened.

02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:31.160
GDP has increased.

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:35.620
Economists predicted that growth

02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:37.860
would stop or be minimal, and

02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:41.440
GDP in 2003 instead grew

02:25:41.450 --> 02:25:44.500
by 7.3%.

02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:47.190
What contributes?

02:25:48.390 --> 02:25:49.910
Please look at the third line

02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:53.430
of investment in capital.

02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:00.490
What happened to the investments in 2003?

02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:07.920
There was an investment boom.

02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:10.560
Increased investment costs

02:26:10.570 --> 02:26:11.920
of companies.

02:26:13.610 --> 02:26:17.470
But investments in the macroeconomy

02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:19.070
play a dual role.

02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:26.270
On the one hand, investment is a

02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:29.890
component of aggregate demand.

02:26:30.090 --> 02:26:32.350
When companies make investments,

02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:34.250
it means they order new equipment,

02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:36.330
for example, from machinery

02:26:36.370 --> 02:26:38.150
manufacturers.

02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:42.860
Investment is part of

02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:44.680
the total demand.

02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:47.000
When the equipment is purchased

02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:52.890
and installed, what happens as a result?

02:26:53.410 --> 02:26:56.230
The production capacity of the companies

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.770
is increasing.

02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:01.840
But if the production capacity of firms

02:27:01.850 --> 02:27:04.880
grows, the potential GDP, that

02:27:04.890 --> 02:27:06.640
is, the opportunities of firms,

02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:08.100
increases.

02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:14.710
So, on the one hand, investments contribute,

02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:17.830
are a component of the aggregate

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:19.510
demand.

02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:20.810
Growth in investment is an increase

02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:21.930
in overall demand.

02:27:22.090 --> 02:27:24.010
But on the other hand, the

02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:26.690
growth of investments means that firms

02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:28.930
have increased physical capital,

02:27:29.650 --> 02:27:30.970
more means of production.

02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:34.050
This means that the potential

02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:36.170
GDP will increase.

02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:39.630
This is the ideal situation.

02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:41.970
Please look at the schedule.

02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:49.490
We go back to the same schedule.

02:27:50.010 --> 02:27:52.290
You see, the overall demand

02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:53.930
continues to grow.

02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:56.090
The curve of hell has already moved to

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:57.850
the position AD3.

02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:03.120
But by increasing investment, when

02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:05.240
equipment is installed, the potential

02:28:05.250 --> 02:28:08.500
GDP grows.

02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:15.810
Consequently, not only is the combined

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:17.570
demand curve shifting to the

02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:20.530
right, but the long-term combined

02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:22.950
supply curve is shifting to the right.

02:28:23.010 --> 02:28:23.510
also also.

02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:26.890
This is an ideal situation.

02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:28.870
A kind of eternal engine.

02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:32.630
On the one hand, demand is growing,

02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.490
but the constant opportunities for

02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:37.130
its satisfaction, i.e. the total

02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:39.110
supply, are growing.

02:28:40.050 --> 02:28:41.990
Simultaneous demand of the total demand

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.950
and the possibility of its

02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:44.890
satisfaction, i.e. the

02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:47.270
total supply, contributes

02:28:47.810 --> 02:28:52.550
to the constant growth of GDP.

02:28:54.310 --> 02:28:56.010
And now, please look at the situation

02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:59.370
of the fourth, fifth,

02:28:59.390 --> 02:29:00.000
sixth.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:06.760
There is a fairly visible pattern here.

02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:12.480
High investment growth rates

02:29:12.490 --> 02:29:18.180
correspond to high real GDP

02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:19.820
growth rates.

02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:24.240
In the sixth year just over,

02:29:24.250 --> 02:29:28.560
investment grew by 13.5%.

02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:32.720
GDP has increased by almost

02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:35.560
7%.

02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:39.820
The key to long-term

02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:44.620
economic growth is a good investment

02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:46.120
climate.

02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:49.700
There will be investments,

02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:50.840
and they will be impossible, at

02:29:50.850 --> 02:29:52.800
least private investment, without a good

02:29:54.370 --> 02:29:56.420
investment climate, and there will

02:29:56.430 --> 02:29:57.840
be sustainable economic growth.

02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:03.480
Of course, it happens and so.

02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:07.200
It is possible that this is a situation

02:30:07.210 --> 02:30:09.940
where the investment climate is very good,

02:30:10.780 --> 02:30:15.320
and private investment does not

02:30:15.330 --> 02:30:19.540
grow so that it is significant, but

02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:22.020
the investment can be made by the state.

02:30:24.260 --> 02:30:26.640
It would seem that the result would be the same.

02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:28.500
High investment and high

02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:29.320
economic growth.

02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:32.920
But experience shows that

02:30:34.410 --> 02:30:36.980
this outcome is relatively

02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:39.460
short-term, for the simple

02:30:39.470 --> 02:30:43.400
reason that the state

02:30:43.410 --> 02:30:49.140
is initially a bad entrepreneur.

02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:52.440
It spends money badly.

02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:55.060
Most often not as efficient as

02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:56.260
the private sector does.

02:30:57.740 --> 02:30:59.920
Public investments are usually less

02:30:59.930 --> 02:31:02.660
efficient than private investments.

02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:06.500
Economic growth in such conditions

02:31:06.510 --> 02:31:09.700
is unlikely to be sustainable.

02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:11.660
And what?

02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:13.580
Let us talk a little bit

02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:15.400
about inflation.

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:18.280
Let us go back to our

02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:19.420
table.

02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:22.660
Inflation means price increases.

02:31:23.980 --> 02:31:25.160
The overall price increase.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
What are we watching?

02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:32.500
Well, at least in the 2000s,

02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:36.320
inflation, fortunately,

02:31:36.330 --> 02:31:38.960
has slowed down.

02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.860
Why this happens?

02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:46.320
To do this, we need to discuss

02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:50.140
the question of what causes

02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:51.460
inflation.

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:54.880
Please look at the slide.

02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:58.660
There are three causes of inflation,

02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:01.620
respectively, three types of inflation.

02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:05.830
The first type of inflation.

02:32:07.330 --> 02:32:10.790
This is inflation caused by increased demand.

02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:14.910
Prices are rising because

02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:16.950
the overall demand is increasing.

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:26.980
The curve of hell is shifting to the right.

02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:29.020
The curve of hell moves to the right.

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:32.560
Graphically, how can this be shown?

02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:41.920
The common model is the total

02:32:41.930 --> 02:32:44.000
supply, the total demand.

02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:48.000
The combined demand function, yes,

02:32:48.010 --> 02:32:52.220
and the short-term combined supply function.

02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:57.730
There is a level of P0 price

02:32:57.740 --> 02:33:02.390
balance.

02:33:03.170 --> 02:33:04.790
The overall demand is growing.

02:33:07.230 --> 02:33:08.650
What happens on the schedule when

02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:09.530
the overall demand grows?

02:33:12.090 --> 02:33:14.270
The combined demand curve, as I have

02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:18.330
already, is shifting to the right to the

02:33:18.340 --> 02:33:20.490
AD1 position.

02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:26.880
What are we watching?

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.880
Prices are starting to rise.

02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:37.410
That is, the increase in total demand causes

02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:40.330
price increases, that is, inflation.

02:33:41.430 --> 02:33:44.230
Usually, this growth in total demand

02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:49.010
is due most often to either an

02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:50.050
increase in public spending or

02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:54.410
to the growth of the money mass in

02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:55.230
the economy.

02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:58.150
The central bank prints more money, the money

02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:01.550
mass grows, the total demand grows, the

02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:03.670
curve of the value of the currency

02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:07.070
moves to the right, prices start to rise.

02:34:07.390 --> 02:34:09.270
This is the first type of inflation.

02:34:11.290 --> 02:34:13.450
The second type of inflation, look at

02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:17.910
the slide, is inflation caused

02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:19.710
by rising costs.

02:34:21.690 --> 02:34:24.370
Prices are rising because

02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:26.650
the costs of producers are increasing.

02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:32.900
When the cost increases, what happens?

02:34:44.990 --> 02:34:47.310
Where is the short-term curve of

02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:48.990
the total offer shifting?

02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:53.310
up to.

02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:55.150
What are we watching?

02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.870
Again, the rise of prices.

02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:08.400
This is the most unpleasant situation

02:35:08.410 --> 02:35:09.980
in the economy.

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:12.600
This is called stackflation.

02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:18.820
This is when price growth is accompanied

02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:23.400
by a fall in GDP.

02:35:23.410 --> 02:35:27.040
Costs for producers are increasing.

02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:30.520
With the previous combined demand,

02:35:33.130 --> 02:35:36.370
the balance GDP decreases.

02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:41.610
This inflation is most often caused by

02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:44.410
the rise in prices of the main types

02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:46.450
of production resources.

02:35:47.070 --> 02:35:51.510
For example, RAO Railways increased tariffs

02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:53.550
for freight transportation.

02:35:53.890 --> 02:35:57.330
Gazprom has raised gas prices.

02:35:58.210 --> 02:36:02.650
The EU has raised electricity tariffs.

02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:07.370
The costs of companies are rising, and they are

02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:10.630
forced to raise prices in response.

02:36:10.890 --> 02:36:12.910
There is inflation caused by the

02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:14.390
increase in costs.

02:36:15.050 --> 02:36:17.930
And finally, the third type of inflation

02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:22.530
is inflation caused by inflation expectations.

02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:27.820
Prices are rising here because both

02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:30.760
producers and consumers expect

02:36:30.770 --> 02:36:33.040
their growth.

02:36:35.770 --> 02:36:37.810
Look what an interesting thing.

02:36:41.010 --> 02:36:42.710
Expectation is a psychological factor.

02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:47.150
In economics, psychology has

02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:48.110
material power.

02:36:49.390 --> 02:36:52.690
If you expect something, it will

02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:54.030
definitely happen.

02:36:54.750 --> 02:36:56.970
And so with inflation.

02:36:57.350 --> 02:37:01.810
If everyone expects inflation,

02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:03.170
prices will rise.

02:37:03.490 --> 02:37:05.170
Why can this happen?

02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:09.590
Well, imagine, the company

02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:13.010
plans, makes a price list for

02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:14.490
next year.

02:37:18.370 --> 02:37:22.050
And it expects prices to rise

02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:24.130
by about 10 percent next year.

02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:24.670


02:37:24.810 --> 02:37:27.110
He doesn't know, but he can expect.

02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:29.070
There are certain inflationary

02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:30.190
expectations.

02:37:30.490 --> 02:37:31.270
What will she do?

02:37:32.130 --> 02:37:35.070
It will definitely put its inflation

02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:36.910
expectations in its

02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:38.650
vacation prices.

02:37:39.310 --> 02:37:41.270
If all companies do this, expectations

02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:42.670
will become reality.

02:37:42.850 --> 02:37:44.550
Prices will really rise.

02:37:46.430 --> 02:37:48.550
That is the danger of inflation.

02:37:48.930 --> 02:37:50.630
Inflation can be prolonged because

02:37:51.310 --> 02:37:53.490
existing inflation generates

02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:55.390
inflation expectations.

02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:58.050
Inflation expectations are

02:37:58.060 --> 02:37:59.550
contributing to new inflation.

02:37:59.950 --> 02:38:01.470
And so it can continue for a long time.

02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:04.550
It is difficult to fight inflation.

02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:07.990
We need to overcome inflation expectations.

02:38:09.210 --> 02:38:10.810
And look at.

02:38:10.850 --> 02:38:14.170
I would like to go back to

02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:20.120
illustrate the causes of inflation

02:38:20.130 --> 02:38:23.740
to the equation of quantitative

02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:25.200
money theory known to us.

02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:28.240
That I explained in the first question

02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:30.220
of this topic.

02:38:43.210 --> 02:38:44.470
M, V, P and Y

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.500
Let us rewrite this equation.

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:51.020
This is this way.

02:38:53.290 --> 02:38:59.710
p is equal to m, v, divided by y.

02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:06.780
What is on the left?

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:09.340
The level of prices.

02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:11.300
In the right side.

02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:14.860
The rest is what the price level

02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:15.500
depends on.

02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:18.640
A change in price level is inflation.

02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:21.100
Why can prices rise?

02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:23.660
Please look at the equation.

02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:25.840
Why then?

02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:30.500
Prices can rise because of growth,

02:39:30.510 --> 02:39:32.500
what?

02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:34.480
Money in the economy.

02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:37.140
The central bank printed more money than

02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:37.980
needed.

02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:41.810
The money mass has grown.

02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:45.450
And with the other equals, prices start to rise.

02:39:46.290 --> 02:39:48.130
This is a typical inflation caused by increased

02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:49.750
demand.

02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:51.690
Why can prices rise?

02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:58.580
Prices may rise because real

02:39:58.590 --> 02:40:00.680
GDP is falling.

02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:02.560
The goods are becoming less in the

02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:04.100
economy, and the money is still

02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:05.380
the same.

02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:08.820
So the former amount of money is

02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:10.320
chased for fewer goods, and prices

02:40:10.330 --> 02:40:12.320
are beginning to rise again.

02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:16.920
This is inflation caused by rising costs.

02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:17.460
Why is?

02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:19.920
Because with the increase of costs,

02:40:19.930 --> 02:40:21.700
production usually decreases.

02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:26.180
Why can prices still

02:40:26.190 --> 02:40:27.020
rise?

02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:32.680
The speed of money circulation increases.

02:40:42.130 --> 02:40:45.250
And this can actually be both inflation

02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:47.210
caused by rising demand and inflation

02:40:47.350 --> 02:40:48.370
caused by inflation

02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:50.150
expectations.

02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:51.210
And that expectation?

02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:52.090
See also.

02:40:52.730 --> 02:40:56.330
You get a salary and expect prices

02:40:56.340 --> 02:40:59.250
to rise soon.

02:41:01.770 --> 02:41:03.130
How will you behave?

02:41:03.170 --> 02:41:04.130
What will you do?

02:41:05.770 --> 02:41:09.130
You will try to get the

02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:11.130
money you get.

02:41:11.350 --> 02:41:12.730
Something to spend.

02:41:13.350 --> 02:41:15.250
Do not leave them at home, otherwise

02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:16.510
they will be dishonored.

02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:20.350
The one who gets your money, what

02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:21.350
will he do?

02:41:21.550 --> 02:41:22.210
The same thing.

02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:25.870
People will spend money faster.

02:41:26.430 --> 02:41:29.050
The speed of money circulation will increase

02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:30.870
and prices will start to affect.

02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:39.760
Why is inflation slowing

02:41:39.770 --> 02:41:41.240
down?

02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:49.000
On the one hand, it would seem,

02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:51.340
if you look at the statistics, the

02:41:51.350 --> 02:41:54.020
money mass is growing in our

02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:55.320
savings quite quickly.

02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:03.300
But the central bank, together with

02:42:03.310 --> 02:42:05.600
the government, is said to

02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:09.320
be bound by excess money or, as

02:42:09.330 --> 02:42:12.400
they say, sterilizing excess liquidity.

02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:19.400
This will result in the

02:42:19.410 --> 02:42:22.240
slowing of the money flow.

02:42:24.010 --> 02:42:28.050
In addition, the factor that inhibits

02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:36.900
inflation is the moderate increase

02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:39.060
in tariffs of so-called

02:42:39.070 --> 02:42:42.830
natural monopolies – Gazprom, RAO

02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:45.350
EU, RAO RZD.

02:42:46.810 --> 02:42:49.630
This leads to the fact that the costs of

02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:51.450
firms are growing quite moderately, which

02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:55.640
also does not contribute to inflation.

02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:59.740
And finally, a very important

02:42:59.750 --> 02:43:02.160
anti-inflationary factor is that

02:43:02.170 --> 02:43:05.460
people have not formed any

02:43:05.470 --> 02:43:07.480
serious inflationary expectations

02:43:07.490 --> 02:43:09.260
in the economy.

02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:14.880
And since inflation expectations

02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:21.200
are low, the rate of money circulation

02:43:22.810 --> 02:43:25.860
will also be low, which contributes

02:43:25.870 --> 02:43:30.680
to the slowing up of price growth.

02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:35.610
There is another very interesting question

02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:40.170
related to monetary policy, the

02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:42.990
connection of inflation with

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.310
the monetary policy of the Central Bank.

02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:50.910
But we will talk about this with you

02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:53.510
in the last topic, dealing

02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:55.770
with modern monetary policy in Russia.

02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:06.600
So, ladies and gentlemen, let's start

02:44:06.610 --> 02:44:08.400
our seventh topic.

02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:11.760
Fiscal fiscal policy.

02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:14.000
Please look at the main issues of

02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:16.700
the topic.

02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:19.400
The first is the budget system of

02:44:19.410 --> 02:44:20.820
the Russian Federation,

02:44:21.260 --> 02:44:24.280
the state budget and its importance.

02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:28.490
The definition is very simple.

02:44:28.770 --> 02:44:31.030
Budget is a form of education

02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:33.330
and spending of funds to ensure

02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:35.510
the functions of state

02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:38.370
authorities and local self-government.

02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:42.730
The Russian budgetary system consists

02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:45.550
of three levels.

02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:48.090
The first level is the federal

02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:50.650
budget and the budgets of state non-

02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:52.110
budgetary funds.

02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:55.950
The second level is the budgets of the constituent

02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:58.930
entities of the Russian Federation and the

02:44:58.940 --> 02:45:02.070
budgets of territorial extra-budgetary funds.

02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:04.970
The third level is local budgets.

02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:08.630
All of these budgets together constitute

02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:10.970
the consolidated budget of

02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:13.070
the Russian Federation.

02:45:14.970 --> 02:45:17.590
In terms of how large the expenses

02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:19.770
of the consolidated

02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:22.830
budget can be said about the

02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:24.910
degree of state intervention

02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:26.650
in the economy.

02:45:28.050 --> 02:45:29.910
Consolidated budget

02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:31.490
spending is approximately

02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:37.490
27.5% of GDP.

02:45:37.730 --> 02:45:39.910
Compared to economically developed

02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:43.010
countries, this is a rather

02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:46.050
moderate figure.

02:45:46.530 --> 02:45:49.570
However, for a country, which is

02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:51.630
not yet very rich, this figure is

02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:54.290
considered to be quite large.

02:45:54.510 --> 02:45:57.090
What would be good would be to reduce

02:45:57.100 --> 02:46:00.350
the share of the state in the economy a little.

02:46:07.020 --> 02:46:10.180
The leading link in the budget

02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:12.160
system is the state or

02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:13.480
federal budget.

02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:16.320
This is the basic plan for the formation

02:46:16.330 --> 02:46:18.420
and use of the centralized monetary

02:46:18.430 --> 02:46:20.040
fund of the state.

02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:23.760
The federal budget, like any other,

02:46:23.770 --> 02:46:26.780
consists of the income and expenditure

02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:28.620
parts.

02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:31.780
The income part of the state

02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:34.420
budget is formed by taxes

02:46:34.430 --> 02:46:37.240
and non-tax revenues.

02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:40.040
The federal budget is charged

02:46:40.050 --> 02:46:42.740
basic taxes, such as VAT, excise

02:46:42.980 --> 02:46:46.120
duties, customs duties, mineral

02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:48.540
mining tax and others.

02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:53.280
The income part of the

02:46:53.290 --> 02:46:57.380
state budget does not include

02:46:57.390 --> 02:47:01.460
funds from the realization

02:47:01.470 --> 02:47:03.060
of state property, as well

02:47:04.650 --> 02:47:08.340
as loans on domestic

02:47:08.350 --> 02:47:10.540
and foreign markets.

02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:13.940
This is the income part.

02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:17.080
On the other hand,

02:47:17.090 --> 02:47:18.380
the state budget is formed,

02:47:18.390 --> 02:47:21.000
the main most important

02:47:21.010 --> 02:47:23.440
expenses related to priority

02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:26.780
investment programs,

02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:28.940
support for the most important

02:47:29.380 --> 02:47:32.100
sectors of the economy,

02:47:32.110 --> 02:47:34.740
social and cultural

02:47:34.750 --> 02:47:37.820
development, defense, law

02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:40.640
enforcement, education,

02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.300
healthcare and so on.

02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:47.620
In addition, the expenditure part

02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:50.980
of the budget includes payments

02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:53.560
of interest on state loans.

02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:55.920
The payment of the main amount,

02:47:55.930 --> 02:47:59.460
debt, in the expenditure part

02:47:59.470 --> 02:48:02.420
of the budget is not included.

02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:05.560
These payments are made at the

02:48:05.570 --> 02:48:08.260
expense of new loans or

02:48:08.270 --> 02:48:09.640
a surplus of the state

02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:10.900
budget, if any.

02:48:14.540 --> 02:48:17.640
The budget consists

02:48:17.650 --> 02:48:20.960
of two main

02:48:20.970 --> 02:48:24.780
parts.

02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:28.200
On the one hand, it is interest

02:48:28.210 --> 02:48:31.240
costs, that is, it is the cost

02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:32.500
of paying interest on

02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:35.320
government loans, and on the other

02:48:35.330 --> 02:48:37.920
hand, non-interest or all

02:48:37.930 --> 02:48:39.540
other costs.

02:48:41.430 --> 02:48:43.810
Increased public spending

02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:47.030
over income is a deficit

02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:49.930
of the federal budget.

02:48:50.290 --> 02:48:52.650
In contrast, excess

02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:53.950
of government revenues over

02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:56.830
expenditure means a surplus

02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:58.510
of the state budget.

02:48:59.830 --> 02:49:02.190
If the state income exceeds only

02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:04.430
the non-procent expenses, we

02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:07.650
are talking about the primary

02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:10.410
profit of the state budget.

02:49:12.430 --> 02:49:16.130
In the 1990s, the Russian

02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:20.230
state budget was deficit.

02:49:20.430 --> 02:49:23.290
In fact, this deficit and

02:49:23.300 --> 02:49:26.210
the accumulated government debt

02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:29.450
actually led to the August

02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:31.050
98 crisis.

02:49:33.870 --> 02:49:37.730
But in the 99th year, we

02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:40.730
reached a small primary

02:49:40.740 --> 02:49:43.370
surplus of the state budget

02:49:43.380 --> 02:49:45.770
with a small overall deficit.

02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:49.950
Since the year 2000, the

02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:52.630
state budget has been reduced

02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:55.650
to a surplus.

02:49:55.660 --> 02:49:58.730
And with an increasing surplus, which is important.

02:50:00.210 --> 02:50:02.530
Please see the following

02:50:03.670 --> 02:50:04.770
slide.

02:50:04.850 --> 02:50:07.110
Execution of the federal budget of

02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:10.550
the Russian Federation in percentage

02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:12.210
of GDP.

02:50:12.750 --> 02:50:16.510
The first line is from the 99th

02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:18.350
to the 6th.

02:50:18.730 --> 02:50:22.350
The next line is income, expenditure and

02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:23.970
deficit or surplus.

02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:26.570
Income and expenses are

02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:30.570
not calculated in rubles, but

02:50:30.580 --> 02:50:33.810
in percentage of gross domestic

02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:35.930
product.

02:50:36.370 --> 02:50:39.650
In the year 1991, we had

02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:42.950
a small budget deficit.

02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:44.090
See the result?

02:50:44.470 --> 02:50:48.470
minus 1.3% of GDP

02:50:49.410 --> 02:50:52.330
Since 2000, there has

02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:55.630
been a surplus.

02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:58.250
It has been very big lately.

02:50:58.410 --> 02:51:03.410
7.5% of GDP just ended in

02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:05.930
2006.

02:51:08.890 --> 02:51:12.490
The state budget surplus leads to

02:51:12.670 --> 02:51:14.630
the fact that the state now does

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:17.670
not need to take new loans to

02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:19.610
cover the deficit.

02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:23.410
On the contrary, we started

02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:25.350
to pay off old debts at

02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:27.170
an accelerated rate.

02:51:27.550 --> 02:51:29.090
Moreover, as the surplus is large,

02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:31.210
a stabilization

02:51:31.220 --> 02:51:32.950
fund is formed.

02:51:36.340 --> 02:51:37.660
Please see the following

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:39.080
slide.

02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:40.800
The total amount of the

02:51:40.810 --> 02:51:42.860
stabilization fund in billions

02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:43.940
of rubles.

02:51:45.340 --> 02:51:46.960
We opened the stabilization

02:51:46.970 --> 02:51:49.020
fund in 2004.

02:51:49.500 --> 02:51:52.540
And then it grows very quickly.

02:51:52.980 --> 02:51:54.900
And so far it has reached

02:51:54.910 --> 02:52:02.600
2 trillion 812 billion rubles.

02:52:05.650 --> 02:52:08.990
There are many disputes about

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.810
the stabilization fund.

02:52:13.390 --> 02:52:15.110
It is a common view that

02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:19.250
since we are not rich,

02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:24.310
it is not right that

02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:27.070
this money should be

02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:31.210
left unmoving and not spent.

02:52:31.430 --> 02:52:33.050
It is proposed to allow them

02:52:33.060 --> 02:52:34.990
to support the poor,

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:35.850
to finance some priority

02:52:35.860 --> 02:52:37.590
programs for the development

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:39.490
of the national economy,

02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:40.430
and so on.

02:52:41.330 --> 02:52:43.810
Finance Minister Alexei

02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:46.690
Kudrin opposes this.

02:52:47.470 --> 02:52:49.170
But in general, it is now about the

02:52:49.180 --> 02:52:51.810
fact that the stabilization fund

02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:54.190
is gradually beginning

02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:57.750
to be uncumped, to allow it

02:52:57.760 --> 02:52:59.150
to be at least partially

02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:01.610
funded for investment programs,

02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:03.430
the most important

02:53:03.440 --> 02:53:05.510
investment, economic programs.

02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:11.800
And yet, I would like to discuss

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:19.470
whether the Ministry of Finance is

02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:22.450
doing the right thing, increasing

02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:24.010
the stabilization fund fund,

02:53:24.210 --> 02:53:25.750
increasing these funds at such

02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:27.970
a rapid pace.

02:53:28.490 --> 02:53:30.610
The stabilization fund has

02:53:30.620 --> 02:53:32.630
a double purpose.

02:53:33.470 --> 02:53:35.990
On the one hand, it is a

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.870
kind of pillow, some

02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:42.430
state savings in case the

02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:47.190
budget revenue suddenly drops.

02:53:49.470 --> 02:53:51.970
This is a state reserve.

02:53:52.770 --> 02:53:54.070
There is also another function

02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:55.850
of the stabilization fund.

02:53:56.530 --> 02:53:59.090
Through the stabilization fund,

02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:02.550
the government takes out the economy

02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:09.650
of the excess money that is effectively

02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:13.450
used in the economy can not be.

02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:17.330
That is exactly what many disagree

02:54:17.340 --> 02:54:19.250
with, believe that it is possible,

02:54:19.370 --> 02:54:20.270
it cannot be used.

02:54:21.810 --> 02:54:23.530
I would like to make this

02:54:23.540 --> 02:54:25.370
analogy here.

02:54:27.810 --> 02:54:32.970
Money in the economy is like water in nature.

02:54:36.530 --> 02:54:39.630
Well, it is obvious that if the earth is

02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:43.490
not watered, then nothing will grow on the earth.

02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:45.290
The harvest is zero.

02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.620
And if the earth is watered

02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:53.480
in a fracturable way, we will

02:54:53.490 --> 02:54:58.140
get a mud on which nothing will grow.

02:54:58.580 --> 02:54:59.260
The Conclusion.

02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:03.800
Water should be directed to

02:55:03.810 --> 02:55:07.460
the earth a little and a lot,

02:55:07.470 --> 02:55:09.440
and exactly as much as the

02:55:09.450 --> 02:55:12.400
earth can perceive and turn into

02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:14.860
some useful product, some crop.

02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:16.280
As well in the economy.

02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:21.040
If we have too little money in

02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:23.920
the economy, we will provoke

02:55:23.930 --> 02:55:24.880
a recession.

02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:28.060
If there is too much money in the economy,

02:55:28.070 --> 02:55:30.740
we will get inflation.

02:55:31.860 --> 02:55:32.620
So the conclusion.

02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:36.420
Money must be like water

02:55:36.430 --> 02:55:39.420
in nature, just as much as

02:55:39.430 --> 02:55:42.180
the economic soil can

02:55:42.190 --> 02:55:46.520
absorb and turn into useful products.

02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:51.630
If we are polishing the economy too

02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:55.290
much with money, we are threatened by inflation.

02:55:57.580 --> 02:56:01.100
Therefore, the Ministry of Finance,

02:56:01.110 --> 02:56:03.540
together with the Central Bank, is seeking

02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:06.440
to sterilize, to remove the excess

02:56:06.450 --> 02:56:08.380
money from the economy.

02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:14.270
In order to fight inflation.

02:56:14.570 --> 02:56:20.350
So if we want to send more money

02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:23.370
to the economy, we need

02:56:23.380 --> 02:56:25.730
to think about it, I repeat,

02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:27.850
the economic soil can

02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:30.850
take that money.

02:56:31.990 --> 02:56:34.990
This means creating a

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.370
favorable investment climate.

02:56:38.270 --> 02:56:40.430
If the investment climate is not

02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:43.710
good enough, then it is pointless

02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:46.630
to send money into the economy.

02:56:47.370 --> 02:56:49.790
Money or go to the sand, let'

02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:52.890
s say, will be robbed, and they will no

02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:55.030
longer become a stabilization

02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:58.170
fund of the Ministry of Finance, but

02:56:58.180 --> 02:56:59.930
a stabilization fund of specific individuals

02:56:59.940 --> 02:57:02.190
somewhere in the offshore.

02:57:06.140 --> 02:57:09.680
Well, I have already said that in the

02:57:09.690 --> 02:57:13.880
plans of the government is still to

02:57:13.890 --> 02:57:17.680
increase public investment in the economy.

02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:23.360
Well, if this leads to

02:57:23.370 --> 02:57:24.860
a normal result, if that money

02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:26.800
is spent normally,

02:57:26.810 --> 02:57:29.860
it will be spent effectively.

02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:32.300
If, I repeat, they are not used effectively,

02:57:32.310 --> 02:57:33.960
they will either simply go to the

02:57:33.970 --> 02:57:36.200
sand, or they will turn the

02:57:36.210 --> 02:57:38.300
economic soil into mud, and we

02:57:38.310 --> 02:57:41.040
will only get a price increase.

02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:50.840
I said we are doing well

02:57:50.850 --> 02:57:53.520
with the budget.

02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:57.120
We have a significant surplus

02:57:57.130 --> 02:57:58.420
of the state.

02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:01.340
We pay off debts, we form a stabilization

02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:03.000
fund.

02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:07.280
However, this does not mean

02:58:07.290 --> 02:58:09.500
that we have no budget problems.

02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:13.200
Problems are and very serious.

02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:16.980
The first group of problems is related

02:58:16.990 --> 02:58:19.460
to the high dependence of budget

02:58:19.470 --> 02:58:22.180
revenues on the global energy

02:58:22.190 --> 02:58:24.740
conditions, on world oil and gas

02:58:24.750 --> 02:58:25.280
prices.

02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:29.320
Oil and gas generate

02:58:29.330 --> 02:58:35.040
about 50% of budget revenues.

02:58:35.050 --> 02:58:37.820
And the world prices will fall.

02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:40.700
It is full.

02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:42.900
It is very quick to eliminate

02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:45.040
the budget surplus and,,

02:58:45.050 --> 02:58:47.820
even its deficit.

02:58:50.710 --> 02:58:52.150
In this sense, the government

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:53.830
has planned this, in my opinion,

02:58:54.410 --> 02:58:56.550
a rather interesting reform.

02:58:57.310 --> 02:59:04.050
Since 2008, the non-oil and

02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:08.470
gas budget is planned to be reformed.

02:59:08.770 --> 02:59:10.430
What does this mean?

02:59:10.830 --> 02:59:11.490
And here is what.

02:59:12.590 --> 02:59:18.290
All state revenues from oil

02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:21.330
and gas, as well as

02:59:21.340 --> 02:59:23.690
state revenues from oil exports

02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:26.130
will be accumulated

02:59:26.140 --> 02:59:29.010
in a special oil and

02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:31.810
gas fund.

02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:35.350
In turn, this oil and gas fund

02:59:35.360 --> 02:59:39.870
will be split into two funds.

02:59:41.070 --> 02:59:44.770
The Reserve Fund and the Fund for Future Generations.

02:59:45.510 --> 02:59:48.270
In fact, there will

02:59:48.280 --> 02:59:50.230
be no stabilization fund

02:59:50.240 --> 02:59:51.150
since 2008.

02:59:52.090 --> 02:59:53.410
There will be two funds.

02:59:54.510 --> 02:59:57.450
The Reserve Fund and the Fund for Future Generations.

02:59:57.460 --> 02:59:59.970
These funds, I repeat, will go all

03:00:00.250 --> 03:00:04.750
the revenues from oil and gas and

03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:06.190
oil products exports.

03:00:08.320 --> 03:00:10.640
But if a significant part of its income

03:00:10.650 --> 03:00:12.980
is lost, the federal budget

03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:16.220
will obviously immediately become deficit.

03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:23.880
In this case, a certain oil and gas transfer

03:00:23.890 --> 03:00:26.440
from the reserve fund to the

03:00:26.450 --> 03:00:30.140
expenditure part of the budget is provided

03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:33.080
to cover the expenditure part

03:00:33.090 --> 03:00:34.820
of the budget.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:39.760
But the idea is that the size of

03:00:39.770 --> 03:00:42.540
this oil-gas transfer must be

03:00:42.550 --> 03:00:43.860
strictly determined.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:45.500
Rather, the ceiling

03:00:45.510 --> 03:00:47.360
of this oil-gas transfer must

03:00:47.370 --> 03:00:48.440
be strictly defined.

03:00:50.180 --> 03:00:55.960
It is not planned to exceed 3.7% of

03:00:55.970 --> 03:00:58.900
GDP.

03:00:58.940 --> 03:01:00.120
The idea what?

03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:03.460
The Ministry of Finance is trying, the government

03:01:03.470 --> 03:01:09.280
is trying to teach the economy to become

03:01:09.290 --> 03:01:13.300
as independent as possible from

03:01:13.310 --> 03:01:15.160
incomes, from energy resources.

03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:20.010
This is what I spoke about the

03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:23.130
problem of forming the income part

03:01:23.140 --> 03:01:24.370
of the budget.

03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:27.970
The budget spending is

03:01:27.980 --> 03:01:30.550
also a problem.

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:36.760
The costs are still

03:01:36.770 --> 03:01:40.400
calculated inefficiently.

03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:44.140
Expenditures are included in the state budget,

03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:45.560
and certain items of expenditure

03:01:45.570 --> 03:01:47.480
are included in the state budget often

03:01:47.490 --> 03:01:48.320
not because they are really needed,

03:01:48.330 --> 03:01:52.820
but because they are done year

03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:53.700
after year.

03:01:54.180 --> 03:01:56.640
Or because certain lobbyists

03:01:56.650 --> 03:02:00.100
manage to break through these costs.

03:02:02.610 --> 03:02:04.530
This is on the one hand, and on

03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:06.890
the other hand, when the money is

03:02:06.900 --> 03:02:08.430
allocated for a particular item

03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:11.690
of expenditure, it is often spent

03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:13.670
inefficiently.

03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:19.800
In the case of the inefficiency

03:02:19.810 --> 03:02:23.280
of public spending, I would like

03:02:23.290 --> 03:02:30.200
to give you this matrix, which

03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:34.520
was made by the famous,

03:02:34.540 --> 03:02:36.920
recently deceased American economist,

03:02:36.930 --> 03:02:38.880
Nobel Prize laureate Milton

03:02:38.890 --> 03:02:40.660
Friedman.

03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:44.640
The Friedman Matrix.

03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:46.960
What does Friedman come from?

03:02:47.540 --> 03:02:51.080
Money is yours and money

03:02:51.090 --> 03:02:54.420
is someone else's.

03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:57.540
On the other hand, money can

03:02:57.550 --> 03:03:00.440
be spent for yourself, and

03:03:00.450 --> 03:03:02.300
money can be spent for

03:03:02.310 --> 03:03:03.120
others.

03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:06.440
This is the construction of the matrix.

03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:22.800
The four segments.

03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:32.200
Here is my money, here is the money of others.

03:03:43.490 --> 03:03:46.590
Here for yourself, here for

03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:50.100
others.

03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:01.540
What do individuals, households

03:04:01.550 --> 03:04:03.820
or companies spend?

03:04:06.350 --> 03:04:08.650
Money for yourself.

03:04:10.310 --> 03:04:12.090
When you get some income, you spend

03:04:12.450 --> 03:04:14.090
it for yourself and your family

03:04:14.100 --> 03:04:15.830
members, and you spend

03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:17.070
your money.

03:04:17.870 --> 03:04:21.070
In this case, spending

03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:24.190
is done in the best way, the

03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:26.050
most rational way.

03:04:27.710 --> 03:04:31.170
You may be spending your

03:04:31.180 --> 03:04:34.830
money on others.

03:04:37.030 --> 03:04:38.170
When is it possible?

03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:44.580
For example, you buy someone

03:04:44.590 --> 03:04:45.960
a birthday present.

03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:49.920
You spend your money on someone

03:04:49.930 --> 03:04:50.740
else.

03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:53.760
Are you interested in what here?

03:04:55.300 --> 03:04:56.500
At least not to

03:04:56.510 --> 03:04:58.380
spend too much.

03:04:59.640 --> 03:05:03.020
But often you are not so selected about the

03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:05.060
quality of the purchase, because you

03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:06.340
are spending not for yourself.

03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:10.360
Here, the money is not spent as effectively

03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:11.720
as in the first quadrant,

03:05:11.730 --> 03:05:15.100
in the first segment.

03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:17.880
What other option is possible?

03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:23.580
You can spend other people's money for

03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:24.500
yourself.

03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:29.060
When do you do it?

03:05:32.980 --> 03:05:38.830
For example, when you eat lunch at the

03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:39.930
company.

03:05:41.790 --> 03:05:43.350
What are you interested in here?

03:05:44.390 --> 03:05:48.650
To get the best set of benefits,

03:05:48.660 --> 03:05:50.950
but you are not interested

03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:53.590
in rational spending of

03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:54.550
money at all.

03:05:57.360 --> 03:05:59.800
You are not interested in saving

03:05:59.810 --> 03:06:02.500
money as much as possible.

03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:03.720
Money is not yours.

03:06:04.860 --> 03:06:07.960
And finally, the worst situation, when?

03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:15.560
When you spend someone else's money

03:06:15.570 --> 03:06:16.320
for others.

03:06:17.960 --> 03:06:19.180
Who does this?

03:06:20.220 --> 03:06:22.120
Who spends other people's money?

03:06:23.840 --> 03:06:24.860
State officials.

03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:29.920
They collect taxes, that is, they don't spend

03:06:29.930 --> 03:06:33.480
their money and they don't spend it for themselves.

03:06:33.980 --> 03:06:36.760
This is the most inefficient

03:06:36.770 --> 03:06:39.180
way of spending money.

03:06:41.370 --> 03:06:42.730
Well, as you probably realized,

03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:46.970
Milton Friedman and the

03:06:46.980 --> 03:06:48.770
Chicago School he headed

03:06:48.780 --> 03:06:51.430
are fierce marketers.

03:06:55.360 --> 03:07:00.360
The role of the state in

03:07:00.370 --> 03:07:01.680
the economy should

03:07:01.690 --> 03:07:04.120
be minimized.

03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:07.600
There are, of course, spheres, they

03:07:07.610 --> 03:07:09.500
know that, where you can't do without

03:07:09.510 --> 03:07:12.160
the state.

03:07:12.180 --> 03:07:14.820
For example, the national defense.

03:07:15.820 --> 03:07:17.060
It is unlikely that private armies

03:07:17.070 --> 03:07:19.120
will be effectivelyined.

03:07:20.040 --> 03:07:21.400
or the protection of the law.

03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:23.160
The state is needed here.

03:07:24.460 --> 03:07:26.800
Well, here, with a heart-wrenching

03:07:27.400 --> 03:07:28.940
heart, Chicago School is

03:07:28.950 --> 03:07:29.940
allowed by the state.

03:07:30.520 --> 03:07:32.440
But at the same time, it

03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:34.720
is aware that public

03:07:34.730 --> 03:07:39.800
spending is inefficient.

03:07:40.080 --> 03:07:42.280
Well, in Russia, we

03:07:42.290 --> 03:07:43.600
have liberal economists,

03:07:43.610 --> 03:07:47.340
they also advocate to

03:07:47.350 --> 03:07:49.420
cut public spending

03:07:49.430 --> 03:07:52.240
in every way.

03:07:52.380 --> 03:07:54.420
The funds released will

03:07:54.430 --> 03:07:56.440
be used more effectively

03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:58.760
in the private sector.

03:08:00.640 --> 03:08:02.800
The next question, the second question of

03:08:02.810 --> 03:08:04.340
this topic.

03:08:04.460 --> 03:08:06.940
Budgetary and fiscal policy

03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:09.560
and macroeconomic regulation.

03:08:10.640 --> 03:08:12.860
From the point of view of macroeconomics,

03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:14.980
budgetary and tax policy

03:08:14.990 --> 03:08:18.220
is a set of measures of the

03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:22.120
state to change the state's

03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:24.560
expenditure and taxes to

03:08:24.570 --> 03:08:27.140
potential GDP and overcome

03:08:27.150 --> 03:08:29.480
inflation.

03:08:30.100 --> 03:08:32.200
In other words, the state

03:08:33.630 --> 03:08:36.600
strives to ensure that the economy

03:08:36.610 --> 03:08:38.620
works at full capacity and

03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:41.420
that prices do not rise.

03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:44.780
There is a distinction

03:08:44.790 --> 03:08:47.560
between budgetary and tax policy.

03:08:48.120 --> 03:08:50.080
Please look at the slide.

03:08:50.660 --> 03:08:52.680
The purpose of a budgetary tax policy

03:08:52.690 --> 03:08:56.220
is to overcome the cyclical recession

03:08:56.230 --> 03:08:58.380
of the economy, when the

03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:01.620
GDP is actually less than

03:09:01.630 --> 03:09:02.940
the potential.

03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:07.140
And it involves increasing

03:09:07.150 --> 03:09:09.640
public spending or tax

03:09:09.650 --> 03:09:12.900
cuts, or a combination of

03:09:12.910 --> 03:09:13.440
these.

03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:18.500
It is clear that when we increase

03:09:18.820 --> 03:09:20.460
public spending, public

03:09:20.660 --> 03:09:21.680
spending is a component

03:09:21.690 --> 03:09:24.920
of the total demand.

03:09:24.930 --> 03:09:26.020
Accordingly, the increase in

03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:27.760
public spending leads to the fact

03:09:27.770 --> 03:09:30.300
that the overall demand is growing.

03:09:32.220 --> 03:09:34.920
GDP is also growing.

03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:40.640
Please look at the schedule

03:09:40.650 --> 03:09:42.420
on the slide.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:47.540
At the beginning, the function of

03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:50.520
total demand is AD0.

03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:54.000
As you can see, the economy

03:09:54.010 --> 03:09:55.580
is under-working.

03:09:55.860 --> 03:09:59.080
GDP is less than potential.

03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:02.080
The point of balance is

03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:04.160
point E0.

03:10:05.360 --> 03:10:07.720
The balance of GDP is Y0.

03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:11.620
The potential GDP is Y with a cover.

03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:15.620
So what can the state do?

03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:19.680
It increases its costs.

03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:22.100
As a result, the combined demand

03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:27.780
curve shifts to the right, and

03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:29.120
the GDP balance can reach

03:10:29.130 --> 03:10:30.600
a potential level.

03:10:35.650 --> 03:10:40.110
But that is something that would be good to remember.

03:10:41.310 --> 03:10:44.670
That in this case works already

03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:47.950
known to you multiplier of autonomous

03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:50.210
expenses.

03:10:50.390 --> 03:10:52.350
After all, if the state increases

03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:55.290
its expenses with this income,

03:10:55.310 --> 03:10:57.490
with this national income, then this

03:10:57.500 --> 03:11:00.510
is autonomous expenses.

03:11:01.570 --> 03:11:03.570
And we have already talked with

03:11:04.210 --> 03:11:06.970
you that in the end, the balance

03:11:06.980 --> 03:11:09.550
of GDP and national

03:11:10.030 --> 03:11:13.050
income increase by a greater

03:11:13.060 --> 03:11:14.770
amount than the initial

03:11:14.780 --> 03:11:15.790
change in public spending

03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:19.710
due to the multiplier effect.

03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:22.670
The multiplier effect I have explained

03:11:22.680 --> 03:11:24.350
to you once.

03:11:24.510 --> 03:11:26.210
For example, if you remember

03:11:26.220 --> 03:11:28.450
the company's investment costs.

03:11:28.830 --> 03:11:30.670
The same effect is also effective

03:11:30.680 --> 03:11:35.250
when the state increases its spending.

03:11:36.650 --> 03:11:39.870
Please look at the slide.

03:11:40.410 --> 03:11:42.870
What is the multiplier effect?

03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:46.150
What is the increase in national

03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:47.750
income?

03:11:48.290 --> 03:11:50.410
The increase in public expenditure

03:11:50.570 --> 03:11:52.850
multiplied by the multiplier

03:11:52.860 --> 03:11:55.570
of public autonomous expenditure.

03:11:56.990 --> 03:11:59.070
And again I want to remind you that

03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:01.390
the multiplier of autonomous costs

03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:05.330
is calculated by the formula known to you.

03:12:05.450 --> 03:12:07.790
Multiplier is equal to a unit

03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:10.050
divided by one, minus the

03:12:10.060 --> 03:12:11.550
limit inclination to consumption.

03:12:12.430 --> 03:12:14.170
Another way of conducting

03:12:14.180 --> 03:12:17.430
a budgetary-tax policy

03:12:19.950 --> 03:12:24.720
is to reduce taxes.

03:12:26.540 --> 03:12:28.260
The state does not increase its

03:12:28.270 --> 03:12:30.480
expenses, but reduces taxes

03:12:30.490 --> 03:12:33.400
in the expectation that

03:12:33.410 --> 03:12:35.900
people will have additional funds

03:12:36.380 --> 03:12:38.360
that they will use to increase

03:12:38.370 --> 03:12:40.940
the overall demand, which will

03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:43.620
again stimulate the economy.

03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:56.090
In this case, the same thing,

03:12:56.230 --> 03:12:58.190
look, you can go back to the old

03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:00.650
schedule, in this case, also the

03:13:00.660 --> 03:13:02.970
reduction of taxes leads to the

03:13:02.980 --> 03:13:04.450
fact that people have more money,

03:13:04.460 --> 03:13:05.930
household people have more money,

03:13:05.940 --> 03:13:08.050
and they can increase

03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:11.030
their expenses.

03:13:11.090 --> 03:13:16.210
Accordingly, the curve of the

03:13:16.220 --> 03:13:19.650
AD shifts to the right, and the balance

03:13:19.660 --> 03:13:22.270
WOP becomes equal to the potential.

03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:25.370
To avoid misunderstandings, I want

03:13:25.380 --> 03:13:30.630
to explain that reducing taxes does

03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:32.030
not mean reducing government spending

03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:33.930
at the same time.

03:13:35.580 --> 03:13:37.060
The government reduces taxes

03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:41.080
but does not reduce spending.

03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:42.680
If it reduced its costs,

03:13:42.690 --> 03:13:45.120
then there would be no stimulating

03:13:45.130 --> 03:13:45.880
effect.

03:13:46.600 --> 03:13:49.300
The state keeps its expenses the

03:13:49.310 --> 03:13:56.360
same, but reduces taxes.

03:13:57.800 --> 03:13:59.860
The disadvantage of such

03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:04.560
a policy is that it can lead

03:14:04.570 --> 03:14:06.940
to a deficit of

03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:08.840
the state budget.

03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:16.060
The deficit of the state budget

03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:22.340
has a negative impact on the economy.

03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:24.200
Especially if he is big.

03:14:24.210 --> 03:14:26.320
The budget deficit is considered

03:14:26.330 --> 03:14:29.580
to exceed 3% of gross domestic

03:14:29.590 --> 03:14:30.780
product.

03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:31.460
That is much.

03:14:33.320 --> 03:14:35.260
Why is the state budget deficit

03:14:35.270 --> 03:14:36.160
bad?

03:14:37.060 --> 03:14:38.700
What is wrong with everything he does?

03:14:43.740 --> 03:14:48.400
If there is a deficit,

03:14:48.410 --> 03:14:54.020
the deficit must be covered.

03:14:55.060 --> 03:14:56.520
How can it be covered?

03:14:57.120 --> 03:14:59.740
You can print extra money.

03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:02.500
This threatens inflation.

03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:06.400
The government often covers the

03:15:06.410 --> 03:15:10.380
budget deficit with loans in the

03:15:10.390 --> 03:15:11.540
financial markets.

03:15:12.020 --> 03:15:13.280
If the government has a

03:15:13.290 --> 03:15:16.700
deficit, it must be borrowed.

03:15:16.980 --> 03:15:19.640
But when such a large borrower enters

03:15:19.650 --> 03:15:23.820
the market, this leads to the fact

03:15:24.760 --> 03:15:27.820
that the price of the loan, namely

03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:30.780
the interest rate, begins to rise.

03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:35.460
And if you remember, investment costs

03:15:35.470 --> 03:15:40.740
of firms and household expenses,

03:15:40.750 --> 03:15:44.200
they are related to interest rate.

03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:47.980
When interest rates rise, business

03:15:48.860 --> 03:15:50.960
investments and household

03:15:50.970 --> 03:15:52.860
consumer spending decrease.

03:15:54.600 --> 03:15:58.120
This phenomenon is called the macroeconomic

03:15:58.130 --> 03:16:00.220
suppression effect.

03:16:00.460 --> 03:16:05.340
That is, if we cut taxes without cutting

03:16:06.540 --> 03:16:08.380
government spending, we will face

03:16:08.390 --> 03:16:11.500
the fact that because of the rise in interest

03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:14.420
rates, investment costs of firms will

03:16:14.430 --> 03:16:17.840
be reduced and partially negative consequences

03:16:17.850 --> 03:16:22.280
will be caused by the increase

03:16:22.290 --> 03:16:27.700
in interest rates.

03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:30.660
This may also partly lead to the

03:16:30.670 --> 03:16:34.000
fact that household expenses will

03:16:34.010 --> 03:16:36.380
not grow so much due to the rise

03:16:36.390 --> 03:16:39.360
in interest rates.

03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:41.680
Well, by the way, the same effect

03:16:41.690 --> 03:16:45.580
will be when the state increases

03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:47.580
its spending without increasing

03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:49.300
taxes.

03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:51.800
The budget deficit also has the

03:16:51.810 --> 03:16:55.320
same negative consequences.

03:16:58.120 --> 03:17:02.160
Well, and if we talk about the good,

03:17:04.380 --> 03:17:07.900
the tax reduction leads to the effect

03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:09.440
of a tax multiplier.

03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:16.090
And this effect means that with

03:17:16.100 --> 03:17:19.650
some tax cuts, the combined

03:17:19.660 --> 03:17:22.090
demand and national income

03:17:22.100 --> 03:17:24.390
will eventually grow by a

03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:26.150
larger amount.

03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:31.610
Please look at the formula

03:17:31.620 --> 03:17:34.570
on the slide.

03:17:34.750 --> 03:17:38.670
Δy is equal to mpc divided by units

03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:41.190
minus mpc, multiplied by the cluster

03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:43.290
minus Δt.

03:17:43.690 --> 03:17:46.790
Δt – change of taxes.

03:17:49.010 --> 03:17:51.090
Why a minus sign?

03:17:51.330 --> 03:17:55.410
Because if taxes rise, it will have

03:17:55.420 --> 03:17:57.590
a bad impact on overall demand

03:17:57.600 --> 03:17:58.770
and national income.

03:17:59.570 --> 03:18:02.550
If taxes are reduced, this, on

03:18:02.560 --> 03:18:05.050
the contrary, has a favorable effect

03:18:05.060 --> 03:18:06.950
on the growth of overall demand

03:18:06.960 --> 03:18:10.170
and national income.

03:18:13.270 --> 03:18:17.470
MPC, divided into units

03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:21.610
minus MPC, is a tax multiplier.

03:18:22.290 --> 03:18:24.910
Here it just shows how much

03:18:25.450 --> 03:18:27.650
rubles changes the total

03:18:27.660 --> 03:18:29.090
demand and national income

03:18:29.100 --> 03:18:33.370
when taxes change by 1 ruble.

03:18:33.810 --> 03:18:35.530
The tax multiplier is described

03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:37.730
in more detail in the text of

03:18:37.740 --> 03:18:38.830
the lectures.

03:18:43.220 --> 03:18:46.500
I was talking about fiscal-

03:18:46.510 --> 03:18:48.160
budgetary policies.

03:18:49.380 --> 03:18:51.000
Another type of budgetary

03:18:51.010 --> 03:18:53.760
tax policy is the deterrent

03:18:53.770 --> 03:18:56.960
fiscal policy, which is applied

03:18:56.970 --> 03:19:00.040
when the GDP actually exceeds

03:19:00.050 --> 03:19:02.420
the potential, that is, the

03:19:02.430 --> 03:19:05.440
economy is overloaded.

03:19:05.760 --> 03:19:08.980
This situation is filled with inflation.

03:19:09.220 --> 03:19:10.540
The economy will still return

03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:12.980
the potential GDP, but at higher

03:19:12.990 --> 03:19:14.940
prices.

03:19:15.100 --> 03:19:17.560
And in order to prevent inflation,

03:19:18.020 --> 03:19:21.480
the state reduces its expenses or

03:19:21.490 --> 03:19:24.900
increases taxes, or does both, carries

03:19:24.910 --> 03:19:26.260
out a combination of

03:19:26.270 --> 03:19:27.400
these measures.

03:19:30.740 --> 03:19:32.120
Both reducing government spending

03:19:32.130 --> 03:19:36.060
and increasing taxes lead to the

03:19:36.070 --> 03:19:38.540
fact that the combined demand

03:19:38.550 --> 03:19:41.300
curve shifts to the left, and

03:19:41.310 --> 03:19:45.900
the balanced GDP returns

03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:47.820
to the potential level, look

03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:50.060
at the slide, returns to

03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:52.840
the potential level, and

03:19:52.850 --> 03:19:55.680
inflation does not occur.

03:19:59.450 --> 03:20:00.390
Well, here I would like

03:20:00.400 --> 03:20:01.710
to emphasize that all

03:20:01.720 --> 03:20:03.810
multiplicative effects at the same time

03:20:03.820 --> 03:20:06.210
act in the opposite direction.

03:20:06.730 --> 03:20:08.950
To conclude this question and at the

03:20:08.960 --> 03:20:11.270
same time this topic, I would

03:20:11.280 --> 03:20:13.110
like to say a few words about

03:20:13.120 --> 03:20:16.230
the long-term consequences of tax

03:20:16.240 --> 03:20:17.610
policy budget.

03:20:19.430 --> 03:20:22.830
In fact, what I told you before

03:20:22.840 --> 03:20:26.390
is all about short-term

03:20:26.400 --> 03:20:30.850
politics, politics of

03:20:30.860 --> 03:20:34.430
treating a sick organism.

03:20:34.750 --> 03:20:39.430
For example, the economy is experiencing

03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:41.790
a decline, meaning you need to

03:20:41.800 --> 03:20:44.230
give the economy a pill, increase

03:20:44.240 --> 03:20:47.270
in public spending or tax cuts.

03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:50.050
Economies are threatening inflation,

03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:52.770
we need to inject spending cuts

03:20:52.780 --> 03:20:54.910
or tax increases.

03:20:56.210 --> 03:20:59.390
This is the policy of treating

03:20:59.400 --> 03:21:00.000
the sick organism.

03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:05.660
But it is important to talk

03:21:05.670 --> 03:21:09.640
about the long-term

03:21:09.650 --> 03:21:12.680
consequences of fiscal policy.

03:21:14.040 --> 03:21:16.240
And here we should not forget

03:21:16.940 --> 03:21:19.960
that in the long run the economy

03:21:21.480 --> 03:21:22.960
is aiming for potential

03:21:22.970 --> 03:21:25.680
GDP.

03:21:25.880 --> 03:21:28.000
Accordingly, long-term economic

03:21:28.010 --> 03:21:30.480
growth depends on how

03:21:30.490 --> 03:21:33.600
fast the potential GDP

03:21:33.610 --> 03:21:35.460
is growing.

03:21:39.860 --> 03:21:41.780
Accordingly, fiscal policy should

03:21:41.790 --> 03:21:48.200
be assessed from this perspective.

03:21:48.210 --> 03:21:49.620


03:21:49.660 --> 03:21:51.540
Does it contribute to the potential

03:21:51.550 --> 03:21:53.660
GDP growth or, on the contrary, is it

03:21:54.440 --> 03:21:55.260
inhibiting it?

03:21:55.740 --> 03:21:58.080
There is, as always, no consensus

03:21:58.090 --> 03:22:00.340
among economists.

03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:03.140
But there are economists, I will

03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:06.280
call them state men, who believe

03:22:06.540 --> 03:22:08.820
that the task of the state

03:22:08.830 --> 03:22:11.040
is to carry out large-scale

03:22:11.050 --> 03:22:14.480
investment programs.

03:22:14.490 --> 03:22:16.880
As a result, by increasing

03:22:16.890 --> 03:22:20.280
public investment, we will get

03:22:20.290 --> 03:22:23.380
an increase in economic potential,

03:22:23.390 --> 03:22:25.980
an increase in potential GDP,

03:22:25.990 --> 03:22:29.620
which will ensure long-term

03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:30.680
economic growth.

03:22:32.820 --> 03:22:35.360
Well, I don't want to impose my

03:22:37.770 --> 03:22:39.880
point of view, but I still feel

03:22:39.890 --> 03:22:41.540
closer to the position

03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:43.800
of liberal economists.

03:22:44.260 --> 03:22:47.900
They have a different position.

03:22:48.120 --> 03:22:49.960
They argue that government

03:22:49.970 --> 03:22:53.480
policies to support economic

03:22:53.490 --> 03:22:56.280
growth can have a short-term

03:22:56.290 --> 03:22:57.780
positive effect, but

03:22:57.790 --> 03:23:00.680
in the long run it is devastating.

03:23:00.690 --> 03:23:01.900


03:23:05.950 --> 03:23:09.600
Well, to not be blatant, I will

03:23:09.940 --> 03:23:11.300
tell you such a story.

03:23:11.540 --> 03:23:13.900
It is a classic and has been included in many textbooks.

03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:20.560
19th century.

03:23:24.370 --> 03:23:28.530
France was behind England with the help

03:23:28.540 --> 03:23:29.330
of its fleet.

03:23:32.260 --> 03:23:34.140
And it was decided at the

03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:36.800
state level to provide support

03:23:36.810 --> 03:23:38.420
to the fleet.

03:23:38.430 --> 03:23:40.580
In other words, the government

03:23:40.590 --> 03:23:44.460
will start building new vessels.

03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:47.660
As I said, a large-scale

03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:49.700
investment program was

03:23:49.710 --> 03:23:52.320
decided.

03:23:52.740 --> 03:23:55.220
Public orders have

03:23:55.230 --> 03:23:57.420
increased, new ships have

03:23:57.430 --> 03:23:59.060
been built.

03:23:59.070 --> 03:24:01.960
The construction of new vessels has led to the

03:24:01.970 --> 03:24:03.420
increase in demand for what?

03:24:03.880 --> 03:24:07.040
On a ship, on a tree, on guns.

03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:08.920
There was also a pleasant

03:24:08.930 --> 03:24:11.500
multiplicative effect across the economy.

03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:15.340
In a relatively short time,

03:24:15.350 --> 03:24:17.720
France became the

03:24:17.730 --> 03:24:20.800
owner of the world's largest

03:24:20.810 --> 03:24:22.200
navy.

03:24:24.340 --> 03:24:25.520
Pattern of sail.

03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:28.760
In England, steam ships were already built

03:24:28.770 --> 03:24:29.980
at this time.

03:24:32.780 --> 03:24:34.980
This is a very clear example

03:24:34.990 --> 03:24:36.560
of the inefficiency

03:24:36.570 --> 03:24:38.660
of public spending in

03:24:38.670 --> 03:24:40.820
the long run.

03:24:42.340 --> 03:24:46.060
Moreover, public spending is inefficient

03:24:46.070 --> 03:24:50.480
in the modern era, when economies

03:24:50.660 --> 03:24:53.560
are very fast, when

03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:54.840
social needs change

03:24:54.850 --> 03:24:56.000
very quickly.

03:24:56.340 --> 03:24:58.220
And economies need to be very

03:24:58.230 --> 03:25:01.660
flexible, very quickly restructuring.

03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:05.360
And the state in this regard, well,

03:25:05.370 --> 03:25:06.580
it is not its strongest side

03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:07.860
the ability to quickly rebuild.

03:25:09.890 --> 03:25:14.110
Well, for example, we can

03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:16.330
take a state program to

03:25:16.340 --> 03:25:18.650
release the best computers and

03:25:18.660 --> 03:25:19.630
mobile phones.

03:25:20.490 --> 03:25:23.910
Let us assume that we will that goal.

03:25:26.050 --> 03:25:28.930
But when we reach it, we will find that

03:25:28.940 --> 03:25:31.330
the whole world has gone far ahead,

03:25:31.530 --> 03:25:33.830
and in a completely different direction.

03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:35.130
And in such a way, probably, that

03:25:35.140 --> 03:25:37.670
could not even be foreseen at the

03:25:37.680 --> 03:25:40.990
time when we accepted this program.

03:25:41.070 --> 03:25:43.490
For modern economies, flexibility

03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:45.370
is essential.

03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:47.510
This does not mean that

03:25:47.520 --> 03:25:51.390
the state should leave the

03:25:51.400 --> 03:25:52.730
economy at all.

03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:56.230
There are areas, I repeat, where it is

03:25:56.240 --> 03:25:58.070
difficult to do without the state.

03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:03.880
The role of the state in the transitional economy,

03:26:03.890 --> 03:26:06.080
such as the Russian economy, is important.

03:26:09.050 --> 03:26:13.590
The task of the state is to create

03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:16.110
a market infrastructure.

03:26:16.190 --> 03:26:21.690
To ensure that such structures

03:26:21.700 --> 03:26:25.050
are created that ensure the effective

03:26:25.060 --> 03:26:27.530
functioning of the market.

03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:30.510
This is a problem that no one

03:26:30.520 --> 03:26:31.830
can solve without the state.

03:26:34.090 --> 03:26:39.060
As for social expenses,

03:26:42.610 --> 03:26:45.700
they should be reduced

03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:50.300
radically.

03:26:56.260 --> 03:26:59.220
The World Bank recently conducted

03:26:59.230 --> 03:27:01.880
a survey of social benefits

03:27:01.890 --> 03:27:04.360
in five regions of Russia.

03:27:06.180 --> 03:27:10.580
The result was completely deadly.

03:27:13.560 --> 03:27:15.440
More than half of the state benefits

03:27:15.450 --> 03:27:18.940
are not received by those who need them.

03:27:19.340 --> 03:27:20.560
The state's social expenditure

03:27:20.570 --> 03:27:22.260
is inefficient.

03:27:22.660 --> 03:27:26.080
The state must cease to be a

03:27:26.090 --> 03:27:29.960
cow-cow, but must create conditions

03:27:29.970 --> 03:27:33.780
in which every working

03:27:33.790 --> 03:27:36.340
person could provide

03:27:36.350 --> 03:27:37.340
himself.

03:27:37.880 --> 03:27:40.300
This is the real challenge

03:27:40.310 --> 03:27:41.660
for an effective state.

03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:51.020
So, ladies and gentlemen, let us go to

03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:53.700
the last topic of our course with you.

03:27:55.660 --> 03:27:58.080
Money, banks and monetary policy.

03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:00.180
Please see the topic on

03:28:00.190 --> 03:28:02.900
the slide.

03:28:03.560 --> 03:28:07.900
The first is money and money aggregates.

03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:13.930
The first thing I would

03:28:13.940 --> 03:28:15.970
like to point out is that

03:28:16.570 --> 03:28:19.490
it is wrong to claim money

03:28:19.500 --> 03:28:22.010
with the notes we carry in

03:28:22.020 --> 03:28:23.210
our wallets.

03:28:23.810 --> 03:28:26.510
It is money, but it is not the

03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:28.470
only possible form of money.

03:28:30.210 --> 03:28:32.170
This is a strict definition of money.

03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:34.630
Please see the slide.

03:28:35.070 --> 03:28:38.130
Money is any good that

03:28:38.470 --> 03:28:40.870
can perform three functions.

03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:45.930
The first function is the means of handling.

03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:51.150
The second function is the

03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:52.370
measurement of value.

03:28:52.910 --> 03:28:55.010
The third function is the means of storage.

03:28:56.190 --> 03:28:57.970
What do these functions mean?

03:28:58.770 --> 03:29:00.810
Many of you have probably heard

03:29:00.820 --> 03:29:01.870
of it.

03:29:02.570 --> 03:29:04.590
The means of circulation means

03:29:04.600 --> 03:29:07.550
that goods are exchanged through money.

03:29:08.210 --> 03:29:10.530
If there were no money, how would

03:29:10.540 --> 03:29:11.650
we have to exchange?

03:29:12.330 --> 03:29:15.970
Probably a goods.

03:29:16.350 --> 03:29:17.930
In the Barter.

03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:21.110
In principle, exchange is possible, but

03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:23.070
it is very difficult.

03:29:23.210 --> 03:29:25.250
The use of money as a means of

03:29:25.260 --> 03:29:27.450
circulation often simplifies

03:29:27.460 --> 03:29:28.650
the exchange.

03:29:29.010 --> 03:29:31.430
In this sense, money is no less

03:29:31.440 --> 03:29:32.710
a great invention of mankind

03:29:32.720 --> 03:29:34.670
than the wheel.

03:29:36.670 --> 03:29:38.230
The second function is the

03:29:38.240 --> 03:29:39.750
measurement of value.

03:29:39.890 --> 03:29:43.890
The value of all goods is expressed

03:29:43.900 --> 03:29:45.470
in money.

03:29:45.630 --> 03:29:47.570
Again, if there were no money, it

03:29:47.910 --> 03:29:49.150
would be hard to say, for example,

03:29:49.160 --> 03:29:51.530
how much a suit costs.

03:29:51.770 --> 03:29:53.650
So many shirts, or so many

03:29:53.660 --> 03:29:55.490
shoes, or so many shorts,

03:29:55.500 --> 03:29:56.770
and so on.

03:29:58.030 --> 03:29:59.410
There would be no single meter.

03:30:00.490 --> 03:30:03.670
Money allows us to bring everything

03:30:03.680 --> 03:30:06.050
to one measurement – all commodities.

03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:08.650
And finally, the third function is

03:30:08.660 --> 03:30:09.930
the means of storage.

03:30:10.310 --> 03:30:13.970
It means that money performs the

03:30:13.980 --> 03:30:15.430
function when it is not spent immediately

03:30:15.440 --> 03:30:17.330
upon receipt, but is

03:30:17.340 --> 03:30:19.450
saved for further purchases.

03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:24.050
The history of humanity is the history

03:30:24.060 --> 03:30:25.110
of money.

03:30:26.970 --> 03:30:27.690
In my opinion, it is a very

03:30:27.700 --> 03:30:28.850
fascinating story.

03:30:29.490 --> 03:30:31.030
Unfortunately, there is no time

03:30:31.090 --> 03:30:33.590
to explain it in detail.

03:30:33.600 --> 03:30:35.910
Well, you probably know that historically,

03:30:35.920 --> 03:30:37.870
money has been individual commodities

03:30:37.880 --> 03:30:41.670
from the beginning.

03:30:42.230 --> 03:30:44.170
What goods are used as money?

03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:48.320
Those that were in this area are

03:30:48.640 --> 03:30:52.300
the most important, the most used.

03:30:52.860 --> 03:30:55.920
Where is the grain, where is the honey, where are

03:30:55.930 --> 03:30:56.720
the skins.

03:30:56.900 --> 03:30:58.880
The Vikings have brown fish, for example.

03:31:02.380 --> 03:31:04.340
That is what is interesting.

03:31:06.020 --> 03:31:08.400
These were so-called commodity

03:31:11.880 --> 03:31:13.650
money, but there were also

03:31:13.660 --> 03:31:15.650
so-called symbolic money.

03:31:19.120 --> 03:31:21.280
Symbolic money, the role

03:31:21.290 --> 03:31:23.800
of symbolic money performed

03:31:23.810 --> 03:31:27.460
a good that could not be used.

03:31:27.780 --> 03:31:29.780
Not for production or consumption.

03:31:30.040 --> 03:31:31.240
What objects are.

03:31:33.400 --> 03:31:35.860
Where they were shells of some particular

03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:39.320
shape, where they were dog teeth.

03:31:39.580 --> 03:31:41.920
On the island of Yab in the Pacific

03:31:42.140 --> 03:31:44.660
Ocean, money was stones with holes

03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:46.760
in the middle, which was convenient

03:31:46.770 --> 03:31:48.440
to wear on the six.

03:31:48.620 --> 03:31:50.480
The heavier the stone, the greater

03:31:50.490 --> 03:31:52.880
the value in exchange it represented.

03:31:55.280 --> 03:31:56.680
That is, symbolic money,

03:31:56.840 --> 03:31:58.240
some items that are

03:31:58.250 --> 03:32:00.260
used as money, but which

03:32:00.270 --> 03:32:02.000
can not be used otherwise.

03:32:02.010 --> 03:32:04.360
Not for production, not for consumption.

03:32:05.160 --> 03:32:06.760
But the existence of symbolic

03:32:06.770 --> 03:32:09.760
money suggests that

03:32:09.770 --> 03:32:12.260
money can be any good that

03:32:12.270 --> 03:32:14.780
people agree to

03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:17.120
consider money.

03:32:18.080 --> 03:32:19.880
Money is a matter of convention.

03:32:20.420 --> 03:32:22.660
The only thing that is required is

03:32:22.670 --> 03:32:24.740
that this benefit is in limited quantity.

03:32:25.040 --> 03:32:26.420
No one will give real goods for

03:32:26.430 --> 03:32:28.000
something that rolls freely

03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:29.300
under his feet.

03:32:31.140 --> 03:32:33.120
Very often, the use of a particular

03:32:33.130 --> 03:32:34.360
object as symbolic money

03:32:34.370 --> 03:32:36.560
is consumed by the authority

03:32:36.570 --> 03:32:39.040
of the state, which obliges

03:32:39.050 --> 03:32:40.740
the object to pay, and it

03:32:40.750 --> 03:32:42.920
itself accepts it to

03:32:42.930 --> 03:32:43.860
pay taxes.

03:32:44.500 --> 03:32:46.240
But, for example, our paper

03:32:46.250 --> 03:32:48.620
money is nothing but

03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:50.380
symbolic money.

03:32:50.960 --> 03:32:54.480
Because for a thousand ruble

03:32:54.490 --> 03:32:56.460
note you can get much more goods

03:32:56.470 --> 03:32:59.960
in exchange than for a piece of

03:32:59.970 --> 03:33:03.820
paper of the same area.

03:33:06.990 --> 03:33:10.950
How did the history of money develop?

03:33:12.470 --> 03:33:14.770
The role of money has gradually been fixed,

03:33:14.790 --> 03:33:16.790
as you know, behind the precious metals.

03:33:17.270 --> 03:33:18.810
In Europe, silver was first

03:33:18.820 --> 03:33:20.310
money, gold was too little,

03:33:20.320 --> 03:33:22.290
and then gold.

03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:27.170
And then, gradually, gold

03:33:27.180 --> 03:33:30.550
and silver were replaced by

03:33:30.560 --> 03:33:31.950
paper money.

03:33:33.010 --> 03:33:35.410
What is paper money?

03:33:36.730 --> 03:33:39.590
These are actually bank

03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:41.030
debt receipts.

03:33:42.390 --> 03:33:43.890
What did banks do?

03:33:44.930 --> 03:33:47.150
They accepted gold and silver

03:33:47.160 --> 03:33:49.710
in deposits, and instead gave their

03:33:49.720 --> 03:33:51.410
debt receipts to depositors, banknotes

03:33:51.420 --> 03:33:53.630
that depositors used

03:33:53.640 --> 03:33:55.190
for transactions.

03:33:55.570 --> 03:33:57.910
Banks were obliged to exchange

03:33:57.920 --> 03:34:00.690
banknotes for coins at the first request.

03:34:04.270 --> 03:34:06.990
And gradually the world of

03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.850
banks emerged the largest banks,

03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:11.430
central banks.

03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:16.150
And they also took gold and silver

03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:20.250
in deposits, and issued their

03:34:20.260 --> 03:34:23.350
receipts, national paper money.

03:34:25.870 --> 03:34:28.450
The modern paper money

03:34:28.590 --> 03:34:30.810
we are used to is nothing

03:34:30.820 --> 03:34:33.790
more than central bank

03:34:33.800 --> 03:34:35.010
debt receipts.

03:34:37.340 --> 03:34:41.130
But if debt receipts, then immediately

03:34:41.140 --> 03:34:44.690
the question arises of receipt

03:34:44.700 --> 03:34:45.570
for what?

03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:48.840
There was no problem before.

03:34:49.220 --> 03:34:52.640
Central banks were obliged to

03:34:52.650 --> 03:34:55.800
exchange their banknotes, their

03:34:55.810 --> 03:34:58.400
debt receipts, for gold, for example.

03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:03.120
What is bad about this system?

03:35:05.100 --> 03:35:07.300
If paper money is tied to gold,

03:35:07.310 --> 03:35:10.300
then its quantity in the economy

03:35:10.310 --> 03:35:12.520
must correspond to the amount

03:35:12.530 --> 03:35:14.460
of gold in the bank's deposits.

03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:21.290
Imagine that the amount of gold

03:35:21.300 --> 03:35:22.990
in the economy has decreased.

03:35:24.860 --> 03:35:25.920
What will it lead to?

03:35:26.740 --> 03:35:29.200
Paper money will be less.

03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:35.060
Prices will fall, but if the money

03:35:35.070 --> 03:35:37.940
is less, the prices will become less.

03:35:39.420 --> 03:35:40.820
If gold, on the contrary, came into

03:35:40.830 --> 03:35:42.140
the economy, paper money will

03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:44.740
become more, prices will rise.

03:35:46.990 --> 03:35:48.870
But in general, the price jump, even

03:35:48.880 --> 03:35:51.310
up or down, is harmful to the economy.

03:35:52.430 --> 03:35:52.810
Why is?

03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:54.890
Business needs stability.

03:35:55.450 --> 03:35:57.730
Price jumping increases business

03:35:57.740 --> 03:35:59.790
risks, respectively, negatively affect

03:35:59.800 --> 03:36:01.270
the development of the economy.

03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:05.160
In the era of gold standards,

03:36:05.170 --> 03:36:08.240
price hikes could not be avoided.

03:36:08.860 --> 03:36:11.000
A year with high prices could well

03:36:11.010 --> 03:36:12.980
follow a year with low prices.

03:36:13.260 --> 03:36:14.620
Gold came into the economy,

03:36:14.940 --> 03:36:16.560
paper money became more, and prices

03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:19.340
increased accordingly.

03:36:19.540 --> 03:36:21.360
Gold has gone out of the economy, money has

03:36:21.370 --> 03:36:23.420
become less, prices will fall.

03:36:27.940 --> 03:36:28.220
So that it won't be boring,

03:36:28.230 --> 03:36:31.260
I'll tell you a story.

03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:39.270
The United States of America

03:36:39.280 --> 03:36:43.190
in the 90s is now the 19th century.

03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:45.470
In circulation already then were

03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:49.740
paper dollars, but they were subject to

03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:52.200
exchange for gold.

03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:55.390
The amount of dollars in the

03:36:55.400 --> 03:36:57.490
economy should correspond

03:36:57.500 --> 03:36:59.210
to the amount of gold.

03:37:00.770 --> 03:37:02.830
As it went, the fields were

03:37:02.840 --> 03:37:05.130
exhausted, the gold in the economy

03:37:05.140 --> 03:37:05.990
became less.

03:37:08.380 --> 03:37:09.360
Prices have fallen.

03:37:11.070 --> 03:37:12.910
I have already told you that price jumping

03:37:12.920 --> 03:37:13.830
up or down is harmful to

03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:14.650
the economy.

03:37:15.450 --> 03:37:18.030
But when prices fall, there is another

03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:18.610
nuance.

03:37:20.830 --> 03:37:22.170
What do you think when prices

03:37:22.180 --> 03:37:24.410
suddenly fall, who wins, the debtor

03:37:24.470 --> 03:37:25.810
or the lender?

03:37:32.450 --> 03:37:35.990
The creditor actually wins.

03:37:36.250 --> 03:37:38.470
Well, imagine you borrowed

03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:41.790
some amount of money, you plan

03:37:41.800 --> 03:37:44.310
to produce some goods, for

03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:46.910
example, grow the harvest and

03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:50.010
settle with your lender and

03:37:50.020 --> 03:37:51.210
pay interest.

03:37:51.410 --> 03:37:54.450
And prices suddenly fell.

03:37:54.690 --> 03:37:59.650
You borrowed cheap money, and you have

03:37:59.660 --> 03:38:00.970
to give expensive money.

03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:03.250
You will have to do what?

03:38:06.430 --> 03:38:09.950
Give more goods, prices have

03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:11.950
fallen for goods to

03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:15.030
settle with your lender.

03:38:16.780 --> 03:38:19.590
This was exactly what happened in the 1990s

03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:21.170
in the United States.

03:38:21.430 --> 03:38:22.310
Prices have fallen.

03:38:22.750 --> 03:38:24.450
In a difficult situation was

03:38:24.460 --> 03:38:26.350
the real sector, which took

03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:28.270
money, which took money borrowed

03:38:28.280 --> 03:38:30.190
at a fixed interest rate.

03:38:32.850 --> 03:38:34.230
In a relatively good position were

03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:37.150
banks, which gave money in loan

03:38:37.160 --> 03:38:41.030
with cheap money, and received

03:38:41.040 --> 03:38:41.950
expensive money.

03:38:43.950 --> 03:38:46.980
Presidential elections were

03:38:46.990 --> 03:38:48.680
held at this time.

03:38:48.980 --> 03:38:50.420
Two candidates came together.

03:38:52.800 --> 03:38:55.760
One candidate advocated that in

03:38:56.160 --> 03:38:57.720
the field of monetary circulation

03:38:57.730 --> 03:38:59.760
everything should be left the same,

03:39:00.340 --> 03:39:02.720
that paper dollars should

03:39:02.730 --> 03:39:06.240
be bound only to gold.

03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:11.680
And his opponent was in favor

03:39:12.100 --> 03:39:13.580
of the security of paper

03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:15.680
dollars not only gold,

03:39:15.690 --> 03:39:17.880
but silver.

03:39:17.980 --> 03:39:19.100
Why Why?

03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:24.380
What he wanted?

03:39:26.770 --> 03:39:28.150
He wanted inflation.

03:39:28.970 --> 03:39:31.430
He wanted to print more

03:39:31.440 --> 03:39:32.430
money.

03:39:32.930 --> 03:39:34.730
Well, if the security of

03:39:34.740 --> 03:39:35.830
money is not only gold, but

03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:37.530
silver, you can print more dollars,

03:39:37.540 --> 03:39:40.130
and prices will stop falling,

03:39:40.140 --> 03:39:42.710
and maybe even rise.

03:39:43.130 --> 03:39:44.870
The elections are over.

03:39:46.770 --> 03:39:49.810
The Silver Party lost the election.

03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:53.010
After the election, journalist

03:39:53.020 --> 03:39:55.630
Fred Baum wrote a story.

03:39:55.640 --> 03:39:58.730
The wizard from the OS country, which

03:39:58.740 --> 03:40:01.390
was later, many years later, the

03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:02.890
Soviet writer Alexander Volkov,

03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:09.480
having reworked, called the

03:40:09.490 --> 03:40:10.940
wizard of the smaragd city.

03:40:12.260 --> 03:40:14.620
Let us remember what the story is about.

03:40:18.520 --> 03:40:21.460
Girl Ellie against her will is

03:40:21.470 --> 03:40:23.180
caught by a hurricane in a magical

03:40:23.190 --> 03:40:24.300
country.

03:40:25.620 --> 03:40:26.600
Must go out.

03:40:27.160 --> 03:40:28.360
Who does she take as allies?

03:40:31.620 --> 03:40:32.300
Who is there first?

03:40:32.380 --> 03:40:34.040
Who did she find first?

03:40:34.500 --> 03:40:35.060
The first?

03:40:35.260 --> 03:40:35.840
I feared.

03:40:36.600 --> 03:40:38.260
A frail man.

03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:40.500
What do you think is the social layer?

03:40:42.540 --> 03:40:43.460
Of course the farmer.

03:40:44.660 --> 03:40:46.220
The second who is there?

03:40:46.380 --> 03:40:47.180
her satellite.

03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:49.600
The iron wood.

03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:50.600
This is who?

03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:54.110
Of course, the industrial worker.

03:40:55.150 --> 03:40:55.670
The Third?

03:40:57.580 --> 03:40:58.440
The lion is cowardly.

03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:01.360
It is hard to guess here.

03:41:01.440 --> 03:41:03.440
The cowardly Lion, the same candidate for

03:41:03.450 --> 03:41:05.120
president who lost the election.

03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:06.980
I didn't want courage, determination,

03:41:07.180 --> 03:41:08.160
pressure, anything.

03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:14.280
And all this company goes along the road

03:41:15.620 --> 03:41:17.280
paved with yellow bricks.

03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:18.820
Roads of danger.

03:41:19.060 --> 03:41:20.240
They could have died many times.

03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:26.450
And then she finally arrives in the

03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:27.270
Emerald City.

03:41:28.170 --> 03:41:30.030
If you take the American realities,

03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:31.710
the country's main city is what?

03:41:31.810 --> 03:41:35.570
Of course Washington.

03:41:36.050 --> 03:41:40.230
Where all people look at the world through

03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:41.950
green glasses.

03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:45.190
The city ruler, if you take American

03:41:46.930 --> 03:41:47.980
realities, then, of course, the

03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:51.020
president of the United States, promises to

03:41:51.030 --> 03:41:53.960
help everyone, but turns out to be a scammer.

03:41:56.380 --> 03:41:58.400
How does the girl get saved?

03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:03.000
She escapes by learning about the magical

03:42:03.010 --> 03:42:05.500
power of her silver shoes.

03:42:07.730 --> 03:42:10.430
Here is such an allegory around the question

03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:12.650
of what should be the basis of

03:42:12.660 --> 03:42:14.930
the money mass, paper money.

03:42:15.570 --> 03:42:18.130
Gold or Gold Plus Silver?

03:42:21.740 --> 03:42:23.980
How does the modern economy respond to

03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.560
this question?

03:42:25.700 --> 03:42:27.660
Not gold or silver.

03:42:29.310 --> 03:42:32.030
Money in modern countries

03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:35.230
is issued by central

03:42:37.240 --> 03:42:39.390
banks and is not

03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:41.530
tied to gold or silver.

03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:50.980
What is Securing Paper

03:42:52.180 --> 03:42:53.300
Money?

03:42:55.770 --> 03:42:58.910
When central banks plan to issue

03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:01.670
money, they look at the equation

03:43:01.680 --> 03:43:04.090
of quantitative money theory.

03:43:04.530 --> 03:43:05.610
Do you know well?

03:43:14.340 --> 03:43:15.240
Again once again.

03:43:16.100 --> 03:43:18.840
M is the money mass in the economy for

03:43:18.850 --> 03:43:20.760
which the central bank is responsible.

03:43:20.880 --> 03:43:23.560
V is the speed of money.

03:43:24.180 --> 03:43:26.720
P is the level of prices in the economy.

03:43:26.730 --> 03:43:29.880
G = real GDP

03:43:33.730 --> 03:43:36.330
First of all, the central bank

03:43:36.340 --> 03:43:39.690
is trying to predict the speed

03:43:39.700 --> 03:43:41.110
of money circulation.

03:43:42.310 --> 03:43:44.090
It is known, it is given.

03:43:46.280 --> 03:43:48.540
Why should the central bank monitor?

03:43:50.190 --> 03:43:53.590
The growth of the money supply corresponds

03:43:56.640 --> 03:44:01.040
to the growth of real GDP.

03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:09.020
In this case, prices will be stable.

03:44:09.840 --> 03:44:13.040
The economy will grow in the absence

03:44:13.050 --> 03:44:14.180
of inflation.

03:44:15.460 --> 03:44:17.880
If the central bank printed too

03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:21.280
much money, what would

03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:22.440
it provoke?

03:44:24.160 --> 03:44:26.320
Of course, the price increase, inflation.

03:44:27.420 --> 03:44:28.620
What if the central bank printed

03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:29.920
too little money?

03:44:31.360 --> 03:44:34.280
In the modern economy, prices go down

03:44:34.290 --> 03:44:37.120
extremely slowly, extremely reluctantly.

03:44:37.130 --> 03:44:40.820
Prices will probably not fall here.

03:44:41.280 --> 03:44:43.240
In this case, the real GDP will

03:44:43.250 --> 03:44:46.620
fall if there is too little money.

03:44:46.880 --> 03:44:48.600
The central bank is causing

03:44:48.610 --> 03:44:50.820
a crisis.

03:44:51.060 --> 03:44:52.660
So what is the provision

03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:55.780
of money, paper money in the

03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:57.280
modern economy?

03:44:57.900 --> 03:45:01.000
The total real GDP, or more broadly,

03:45:01.010 --> 03:45:03.680
the national wealth of

03:45:03.690 --> 03:45:05.660
a given country.

03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:08.220
Now let's talk about money

03:45:08.230 --> 03:45:10.760
aggregates.

03:45:14.430 --> 03:45:16.970
Well to...

03:45:16.980 --> 03:45:18.210
I will ask you a question first.

03:45:19.490 --> 03:45:20.530
Maybe unhumble.

03:45:21.630 --> 03:45:22.730
Listen, how much money you

03:45:22.750 --> 03:45:24.110
have, please tell me.

03:45:25.350 --> 03:45:27.610
But I will not hear the answer.

03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:30.600
To be honest, I don't care much about him.

03:45:33.070 --> 03:45:34.650
I don't care how much money you have.

03:45:35.350 --> 03:45:36.630
I am interested in something else.

03:45:36.850 --> 03:45:39.810
How would you answer this question yourself?

03:45:40.370 --> 03:45:43.550
What do you consider as money when

03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:46.390
you ask yourself how much money

03:45:46.400 --> 03:45:46.930
you have?

03:45:51.960 --> 03:45:52.700
Well look at.

03:45:53.640 --> 03:45:56.620
Most likely, the first thing

03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:59.680
you will remember is the cash

03:45:59.920 --> 03:46:00.940
you have at home.

03:46:01.860 --> 03:46:03.660
Let's say the desk boxes.

03:46:05.740 --> 03:46:06.940
A known amount.

03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:09.460
Next, what will you remember?

03:46:11.100 --> 03:46:16.000
You will probably remember your

03:46:16.010 --> 03:46:17.320
bank account.

03:46:19.180 --> 03:46:21.020
The money you have on

03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:23.400
your bank account is money.

03:46:24.620 --> 03:46:27.120
But agree, a few others.

03:46:28.240 --> 03:46:30.280
If you have cash, you can go out at

03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:32.500
the nearest kiosk at night and buy

03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:33.780
a bottle of beer.

03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:37.600
There is nothing to do with the bank account

03:46:37.610 --> 03:46:38.360
in the kiosk.

03:46:40.080 --> 03:46:41.240
The accounts will be different.

03:46:42.120 --> 03:46:45.280
If you have a plastic

03:46:45.290 --> 03:46:48.320
card, you may find that a bankomat

03:46:48.330 --> 03:46:49.880
or store is a receiving

03:46:49.890 --> 03:46:51.340
card.

03:46:51.560 --> 03:46:53.040
And if you have the enlightenment of

03:46:53.050 --> 03:46:55.440
accepting a deposit before the

03:46:55.450 --> 03:46:58.580
bank opens, you have nothing to do

03:46:58.590 --> 03:47:00.040
with this certificate.

03:47:01.620 --> 03:47:03.060
And the contributions are different.

03:47:03.680 --> 03:47:08.260
There are current contributions

03:47:08.270 --> 03:47:09.340
that can be used in principle at

03:47:09.350 --> 03:47:10.020
any time.

03:47:10.760 --> 03:47:13.780
There are contributions made for the time.

03:47:14.240 --> 03:47:15.760
They cannot be used before

03:47:15.770 --> 03:47:17.100
the deadline.

03:47:17.540 --> 03:47:19.080
Maybe, but with losses.

03:47:20.320 --> 03:47:22.620
I repeat, money is different.

03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:23.580


03:47:24.700 --> 03:47:27.520
And since money is different,

03:47:27.530 --> 03:47:31.420
there is a desire to sort them out.

03:47:36.240 --> 03:47:37.400
See also.

03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:40.960
Money, you can say, money is

03:47:40.970 --> 03:47:42.560
a liquid asset.

03:47:44.370 --> 03:47:46.350
An asset is property.

03:47:47.900 --> 03:47:51.320
Liquidity, the ability of an asset,

03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:53.120
rapid and without loss, to exchange

03:47:53.130 --> 03:47:54.440
for other assets.

03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:58.050
But the most liquid asset, obviously,

03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:59.230
is what?

03:47:59.870 --> 03:48:00.690
for personal money.

03:48:03.380 --> 03:48:04.920
So here.

03:48:05.160 --> 03:48:08.200
See the definition on the slide.

03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:12.680
Groups of liquid assets with

03:48:12.840 --> 03:48:15.080
approximately the same level

03:48:15.090 --> 03:48:18.440
of liquidity are called monetary

03:48:18.450 --> 03:48:20.740
aggregates.

03:48:25.090 --> 03:48:27.650
The preparation of monetary aggregates

03:48:27.660 --> 03:48:29.490
is the prerogative of central banks.

03:48:30.370 --> 03:48:32.090
Since market economies in different

03:48:32.100 --> 03:48:34.710
countries are roughly similar, aggregates

03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:36.790
are similar.

03:48:37.050 --> 03:48:38.130
Although there is a certain difference,

03:48:38.140 --> 03:48:38.850
of course.

03:48:39.810 --> 03:48:42.590
We will talk about the money aggregates

03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:43.690
in Russia.

03:48:45.790 --> 03:48:46.910
Here, please, look at the table

03:48:47.070 --> 03:48:50.170
of the currency aggregates in Russia

03:48:50.180 --> 03:48:54.030
and their sizes for April 1, 2007.

03:48:56.320 --> 03:48:59.320
The first unit that the Bank of Russia

03:48:59.330 --> 03:49:02.460
allocates is called M0.

03:49:04.220 --> 03:49:06.880
M0 is cash in circulation

03:49:06.890 --> 03:49:09.300
or money outside the

03:49:09.310 --> 03:49:11.080
banking system.

03:49:11.090 --> 03:49:13.500
Money in the hands of households

03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:17.500
or in the companies.

03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:22.960
The next unit is called M1.

03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:25.440
Pay attention to how the aggregates

03:49:25.450 --> 03:49:26.800
are built.

03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:31.260
This is a sort of snow

03:49:31.270 --> 03:49:33.740
coma principle.

03:49:34.260 --> 03:49:37.240
Each next unit includes the

03:49:37.250 --> 03:49:40.120
previous plus something else.

03:49:40.130 --> 03:49:42.500
Each next unit is a broader

03:49:42.510 --> 03:49:45.260
concept than the previous one.

03:49:46.760 --> 03:49:49.900
And the M1 unit actually includes

03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:50.580
what?

03:49:52.020 --> 03:49:54.160
First, M0, cash, plus funds

03:49:56.520 --> 03:49:59.060
on deposits for demand,

03:49:59.070 --> 03:50:01.940
plus funds on current

03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:04.640
billing accounts.

03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:10.480
The next unit is called M2 and

03:50:10.490 --> 03:50:13.040
includes, as you already

03:50:13.050 --> 03:50:17.060
understand, the unit M1 plus

03:50:17.080 --> 03:50:19.080
funds on urgent savings

03:50:19.090 --> 03:50:21.240
deposits.

03:50:22.260 --> 03:50:24.700
The last unit used

03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:27.800
in Russia is the

03:50:27.810 --> 03:50:30.800
M3.

03:50:30.810 --> 03:50:34.450
It includes, as you can see from the

03:50:34.460 --> 03:50:37.510
table, the M2 aggregate,

03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:39.670
plus deposit sortings, plus

03:50:39.680 --> 03:50:46.050
government bonds, plus all foreign

03:50:46.060 --> 03:50:50.470
currency deposits in ruble equivalent.

03:50:50.810 --> 03:50:53.210
Note, the Central Bank of Russia

03:50:53.220 --> 03:50:55.430
reasoning about like spouses

03:50:55.440 --> 03:50:56.730
in the kitchen.

03:50:57.090 --> 03:50:58.470
They wondered, they thought about how

03:50:58.570 --> 03:50:59.350
much money they had.

03:50:59.360 --> 03:51:00.930
First remembered what?

03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:03.090
How much cash do they have?

03:51:03.430 --> 03:51:04.790
This is the M0.

03:51:05.090 --> 03:51:07.650
Then they remembered how much they have in

03:51:07.660 --> 03:51:08.970
the average current account, this is

03:51:08.980 --> 03:51:10.230
the M1 unit.

03:51:10.390 --> 03:51:12.070
Then they remembered how much money

03:51:12.080 --> 03:51:14.750
they had on an urgent savings deposit.

03:51:14.850 --> 03:51:18.110
This is the M2 unit and so on.

03:51:19.370 --> 03:51:22.070
The only thing that differentiates

03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:24.890
the mentality of the bank of

03:51:24.900 --> 03:51:27.230
Russia from the mentality of the spouses

03:51:27.240 --> 03:51:29.690
in the kitchen is that the spouses

03:51:29.700 --> 03:51:32.770
would probably very quickly remember

03:51:32.780 --> 03:51:36.450
their cash currency, dollars or euros.

03:51:37.430 --> 03:51:40.570
But the Bank of Russia, the cash

03:51:40.580 --> 03:51:42.930
currency available in the hands of

03:51:42.940 --> 03:51:47.410
the population, does not include in any unit.

03:51:47.910 --> 03:51:50.310
Includes currency deposits,

03:51:50.320 --> 03:51:53.170
currency accounts in banks

03:51:53.390 --> 03:51:56.490
and cash in no single unit.

03:51:56.570 --> 03:52:00.670
I would like to point out that the money

03:52:00.680 --> 03:52:04.410
aggregates are arranged on the principle

03:52:04.420 --> 03:52:06.950
of decreasing liquidity.

03:52:08.690 --> 03:52:12.090
Each subsequent aggregate includes

03:52:12.100 --> 03:52:14.630
all, less and less liquid assets.

03:52:16.810 --> 03:52:20.090
The most liquid unit M0.

03:52:23.730 --> 03:52:26.910
The lowest liquid assets are in the

03:52:26.920 --> 03:52:28.890
M3 aggregate.

03:52:29.230 --> 03:52:32.770
Liquidity is the ability of

03:52:32.780 --> 03:52:35.170
an asset, quickly and without

03:52:35.180 --> 03:52:38.270
loss, to exchange for other assets.

03:52:39.880 --> 03:52:43.360
Well, the aggregates we and you, I

03:52:43.370 --> 03:52:45.500
think, considered.

03:52:46.220 --> 03:52:48.280
We move on to the second question.

03:52:51.400 --> 03:52:54.680
The second is the two-level banking

03:52:54.690 --> 03:52:58.340
system and the monetary base.

03:52:58.460 --> 03:53:07.420
I will address this question rather superficially,

03:53:07.430 --> 03:53:10.840
I will only say the most general

03:53:10.850 --> 03:53:12.260
things.

03:53:12.360 --> 03:53:14.620
More in detail with the balance sheet

03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:17.300
of the Central Bank, it would be better for

03:53:17.310 --> 03:53:20.400
you to look at the texts of the lectures.

03:53:23.640 --> 03:53:25.920
I will say just that, literally

03:53:25.930 --> 03:53:27.660
a few basic provisions.

03:53:30.560 --> 03:53:33.120
Well, it is obvious that the supply

03:53:33.130 --> 03:53:36.360
of money in the economy is carried out

03:53:36.370 --> 03:53:37.920
by the banking system.

03:53:40.040 --> 03:53:43.000
In a market economy, a two-

03:53:43.010 --> 03:53:44.680
tiered banking system

03:53:44.690 --> 03:53:46.760
is characterized.

03:53:50.280 --> 03:53:53.820
The first level is the Central

03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:57.750
Bank of the country, it is actually

03:53:57.760 --> 03:53:59.710
the main regulator of the money

03:53:59.720 --> 03:54:01.110
mass in the economy.

03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:06.700
The second level of the banking system

03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:09.360
is comprised of commercial banks.

03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:11.320
All banks are considered

03:54:11.330 --> 03:54:13.220
commercial banks except

03:54:13.230 --> 03:54:15.420
the central bank.

03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:17.300
Sberbank of Russia is the

03:54:17.620 --> 03:54:19.860
largest bank in Russia, the

03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:23.020
same commercial bank as a small

03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:26.880
bank in our city, for example,

03:54:26.890 --> 03:54:28.340
in a small city.

03:54:34.480 --> 03:54:36.220
For the basis, please see the following

03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:37.940
slide.

03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:41.720
The basis of the monetary system

03:54:41.730 --> 03:54:45.120
is the Central Bank banknotes

03:54:45.130 --> 03:54:47.360
or cash in circulation.

03:54:49.300 --> 03:54:50.800
Where do they come from?

03:54:52.640 --> 03:54:54.280
Of course, the central bank

03:54:54.290 --> 03:54:56.500
printed cash, but it not just

03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:58.440
printed them, it is not thrown

03:54:58.450 --> 03:54:59.820
out on the streets.

03:55:00.880 --> 03:55:03.980
Cash in circulation, cash

03:55:04.380 --> 03:55:05.940
comes into circulation

03:55:05.950 --> 03:55:08.880
in two ways.

03:55:09.980 --> 03:55:13.280
First, they come into circulation

03:55:13.290 --> 03:55:17.500
when the central bank buys

03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:21.940
gold, foreign currency

03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:25.940
or government securities.

03:55:30.090 --> 03:55:32.290
One can say that the central

03:55:32.300 --> 03:55:34.730
bank is paid by them when

03:55:34.740 --> 03:55:36.610
buying gold, foreign currency and

03:55:36.620 --> 03:55:37.590
securities.

03:55:37.890 --> 03:55:40.370
But that is of course a simplification.

03:55:42.980 --> 03:55:45.200
In fact, the central bank does

03:55:45.210 --> 03:55:48.100
not directly imitate money at the

03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:49.940
time of buying gold, currency

03:55:49.950 --> 03:55:51.360
and securities.

03:55:51.820 --> 03:55:53.580
They are simulated, cash arises

03:55:53.590 --> 03:55:55.440
in circulation later.

03:55:55.450 --> 03:55:58.360
But anyway, when the central

03:56:00.180 --> 03:56:03.950
bank buys gold, currency or

03:56:03.960 --> 03:56:06.890
securities, the cash supply

03:56:06.900 --> 03:56:09.370
in the economy increases.

03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:11.310
But for the sake of simplicity, it

03:56:11.410 --> 03:56:12.110
can be assumed that it

03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:13.910
is paid directly in cash,

03:56:13.920 --> 03:56:15.650
although this is not certain.

03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:19.290
Logic is probably understandable.

03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:23.130
I am a central bank, I buy,

03:56:23.140 --> 03:56:25.490
say, gold or government

03:56:25.500 --> 03:56:26.990
securities or U.S. dollars.

03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:27.850


03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:34.130
When I buy them, I

03:56:34.140 --> 03:56:35.690
issue cash, I pay in

03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:37.330
cash, cash, and

03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:40.090
there is a cash issue.

03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:44.210
On the other hand, cash arises in the

03:56:44.220 --> 03:56:47.970
economy as a result of the fact that

03:56:47.980 --> 03:56:50.330
the central bank lends credit

03:56:50.340 --> 03:56:53.790
to the government and commercial

03:56:53.800 --> 03:56:54.850
banks.

03:56:57.370 --> 03:56:59.370
The Central Bank does not lend

03:56:59.380 --> 03:57:01.430
individuals and firms, it lends

03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:04.110
to commercial banks and the government.

03:57:06.670 --> 03:57:08.710
Well, again, with a considerable

03:57:08.720 --> 03:57:11.510
amount of simplification, it can be

03:57:11.520 --> 03:57:14.150
assumed that the central bank issues

03:57:14.160 --> 03:57:16.010
loans in cash.

03:57:16.270 --> 03:57:19.770
Cash in circulation plus the funds

03:57:19.780 --> 03:57:22.530
of commercial banks on the Central

03:57:22.540 --> 03:57:24.610
Bank accounts form

03:57:24.620 --> 03:57:27.870
the monetary base.

03:57:30.050 --> 03:57:33.790
The monetary base is a kind of skeleton

03:57:33.800 --> 03:57:36.970
of the money mass, a kind of primacy of

03:57:36.980 --> 03:57:38.290
the money mass.

03:57:39.680 --> 03:57:41.820
The money mass in the economy

03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:44.460
grows from the monetary base.

03:57:46.940 --> 03:57:49.120
I just want to emphasize here

03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:53.200
that the cash mass is not

03:57:53.210 --> 03:57:54.240
all cash.

03:57:55.240 --> 03:57:57.240
But you remember that there are

03:57:57.250 --> 03:57:58.540
different money aggregates.

03:57:59.120 --> 03:58:00.960
Cash is only the M0 unit, but

03:58:00.970 --> 03:58:04.400
also the M1, M2, M3 units.

03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:11.410
But still the monetary base is the basis

03:58:11.420 --> 03:58:14.390
of the monetary mass in the economy.

03:58:17.160 --> 03:58:21.060
The central bank creates the monetary base.

03:58:22.900 --> 03:58:25.300
But what is interesting is that

03:58:27.050 --> 03:58:29.520
commercial banks in the process

03:58:29.530 --> 03:58:32.440
of their activities, by issuing

03:58:32.450 --> 03:58:35.500
loans, increase the money mass

03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:36.560
in the economy.

03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:40.810
How does it happen?

03:58:42.530 --> 03:58:44.730
Well, imagine that you or your

03:58:44.740 --> 03:58:47.390
company came to a commercial bank

03:58:47.400 --> 03:58:49.090
for a loan.

03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:51.710
How will a commercial bank give you a loan?

03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:56.910
Most often, you open an account.

03:59:03.800 --> 03:59:07.560
But as you hope to remember, the current

03:59:08.200 --> 03:59:12.560
accounts of firms and the population

03:59:12.570 --> 03:59:14.760
in commercial banks, it is also

03:59:14.770 --> 03:59:17.560
money, it is the M1 unit.

03:59:17.780 --> 03:59:20.700
Accordingly, issuing loans by opening

03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:22.500
accounts, commercial banks

03:59:22.800 --> 03:59:25.840
create additional money in the

03:59:25.850 --> 03:59:28.540
form of an aggregate, in the form

03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:30.800
of current accounts, that is, in the

03:59:30.840 --> 03:59:33.260
form of an aggregate M1.

03:59:35.320 --> 03:59:36.860
How is it done?

03:59:38.020 --> 03:59:40.020
Here you better look at this mechanism

03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:42.520
in detail on the texts of lectures,

03:59:42.530 --> 03:59:45.240
on the text of lectures.

03:59:45.760 --> 03:59:47.360
It is detailed there.

03:59:50.500 --> 03:59:53.080
And we will immediately move

03:59:53.090 --> 03:59:57.260
to another very important issue, monetary

03:59:57.860 --> 04:00:03.080
policy and its instruments.

04:00:03.090 --> 04:00:06.460
Read the definition,

04:00:07.140 --> 04:00:09.000
see the slide.

04:00:09.500 --> 04:00:12.340
Monetary or monetary policy is

04:00:12.350 --> 04:00:15.420
a policy on changing the

04:00:15.430 --> 04:00:18.880
monetary mass in the economy.

04:00:20.340 --> 04:00:22.900
The central bank plays an important

04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:25.760
role in its implementation as the

04:00:25.770 --> 04:00:28.840
main link of the country's banking system.

04:00:32.410 --> 04:00:35.850
Let us look at the central bank'

04:00:35.860 --> 04:00:38.090
s main functions.

04:00:38.430 --> 04:00:39.970
Look at the slide.

04:00:43.420 --> 04:00:46.560
The central bank is the

04:00:46.570 --> 04:00:50.980
country's emission center.

04:00:51.060 --> 04:00:53.840
That is, it monopolyly releases

04:00:53.850 --> 04:00:56.900
national banknotes in circulation.

04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:58.060


04:00:59.830 --> 04:01:04.050
The second function is that the Central Bank

04:01:04.060 --> 04:01:05.630
is a bank of banks.

04:01:06.250 --> 04:01:08.010
What does it express?

04:01:09.070 --> 04:01:11.690
It keeps the reserves of commercial banks,

04:01:11.700 --> 04:01:15.290
issues them to courts, and there

04:01:15.300 --> 04:01:17.690
is supervision over their activities.

04:01:20.650 --> 04:01:23.730
The third most important function of the Central

04:01:23.740 --> 04:01:26.810
Bank is that it is the banking officer of the government.

04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:28.990
What does it express?

04:01:29.770 --> 04:01:32.450
The central bank places state

04:01:32.460 --> 04:01:35.330
securities, provides credit to

04:01:35.340 --> 04:01:36.970
the government, performs

04:01:36.980 --> 04:01:40.570
settlement operations for the government,

04:01:40.580 --> 04:01:43.210
keeps the Treasury accounts,

04:01:43.220 --> 04:01:45.730
and keeps official gold

04:01:45.740 --> 04:01:48.330
and currency reserves.

04:01:50.770 --> 04:01:54.970
The Central Bank is the main settlement

04:01:54.980 --> 04:01:58.270
center of the country, that

04:01:58.280 --> 04:02:01.190
is, acts as an intermediary between

04:02:01.200 --> 04:02:03.910
banks in the implementation

04:02:03.920 --> 04:02:05.950
of non-cash payments.

04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:13.320
And finally, the fifth function,

04:02:13.330 --> 04:02:14.260
which we will actually talk

04:02:14.270 --> 04:02:15.160
about later.

04:02:16.120 --> 04:02:18.780
The central bank is the body of

04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:20.740
regulation of the economy

04:02:20.750 --> 04:02:23.280
through monetary policy.

04:02:24.940 --> 04:02:26.960
Please see the following slide.

04:02:29.130 --> 04:02:32.330
It focuses on the objectives and instruments

04:02:32.340 --> 04:02:33.530
of monetary policy.

04:02:35.250 --> 04:02:37.070
There are strategic goals, there are

04:02:37.080 --> 04:02:38.330
intermediate goals.

04:02:38.590 --> 04:02:40.250
I will speak about the strategic

04:02:40.260 --> 04:02:43.070
goals, the ultimate goals, the goals

04:02:43.170 --> 04:02:44.650
of the Central Bank.

04:02:45.010 --> 04:02:48.210
What does the central bank want?

04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:49.830
What are its strategic goals?

04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:51.610
Look at the slide.

04:02:52.010 --> 04:02:54.770
The first goal is economic growth.

04:02:56.270 --> 04:02:58.110
He wants the economy to grow.

04:03:00.320 --> 04:03:03.120
The second is full employment.

04:03:06.900 --> 04:03:09.320
Unemployment should not exceed

04:03:09.330 --> 04:03:13.060
the minimum required level.

04:03:16.680 --> 04:03:21.110
The third key is price

04:03:21.120 --> 04:03:22.050
stability.

04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:28.170
The fourth feature is a stable balance

04:03:28.180 --> 04:03:29.190
of payments.

04:03:31.480 --> 04:03:34.960
To these objectives, the Bank

04:03:34.970 --> 04:03:37.120
of Russia may use the following

04:03:37.130 --> 04:03:40.900
basic instruments.

04:03:44.080 --> 04:03:46.100
Look at the slide.

04:03:46.480 --> 04:03:50.220
Let's not rush to find out the tools.

04:03:57.810 --> 04:04:01.210
The first instrument is the purchase and

04:04:01.220 --> 04:04:03.410
sale of government securities.

04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:12.840
Or, as they say, operations in the

04:04:12.850 --> 04:04:13.840
open market.

04:04:17.590 --> 04:04:19.210
How can the central bank regulate

04:04:19.220 --> 04:04:22.590
the money supply by using

04:04:22.600 --> 04:04:25.890
this function, by using this

04:04:25.900 --> 04:04:27.130
instrument?

04:04:29.200 --> 04:04:31.640
Well, imagine, I am the

04:04:31.650 --> 04:04:33.100
central bank and you are

04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:35.120
commercial banks.

04:04:36.720 --> 04:04:39.880
Let's say I buy your

04:04:41.330 --> 04:04:43.250
government securities

04:04:43.260 --> 04:04:45.150
in the balance sheet.

04:04:49.300 --> 04:04:52.920
When I buy these papers,

04:04:52.930 --> 04:04:55.000
I pay in rubles.

04:04:55.000 --> 04:05:03.870
That is, I increase the monetary base and

04:05:03.880 --> 04:05:05.730
the money mass in the economy.

04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:07.190
But it can be imagined.

04:05:07.410 --> 04:05:08.950
You are commercial banks, you are

04:05:08.960 --> 04:05:12.370
my securities, and I am the answer to you.

04:05:13.190 --> 04:05:16.110
So, by buying securities, I increase

04:05:16.120 --> 04:05:18.110
the money mass.

04:05:23.320 --> 04:05:26.380
Most often in modern conditions, the

04:05:26.390 --> 04:05:29.140
Bank of Russia carries out operations

04:05:29.150 --> 04:05:32.420
in the open market through direct

04:05:32.430 --> 04:05:36.300
and reverse repo transactions.

04:05:39.260 --> 04:05:40.280
What is it?

04:05:43.620 --> 04:05:46.940
Repo operations, in general,

04:05:47.240 --> 04:05:51.020
are repurchase operations.

04:05:52.730 --> 04:05:56.910
Suppose commercial banks have

04:05:56.920 --> 04:05:59.090
securities.

04:06:00.570 --> 04:06:02.810
They are temporarily sold

04:06:02.820 --> 04:06:04.530
to the central bank.

04:06:05.610 --> 04:06:07.890
The central bank pays in rubles

04:06:07.900 --> 04:06:11.270
and thus increases the money

04:06:11.280 --> 04:06:13.030
mass in the economy.

04:06:14.570 --> 04:06:19.050
But the REPO deal implies that

04:06:19.060 --> 04:06:21.370
after a certain time commercial

04:06:21.380 --> 04:06:26.150
banks are obliged to buy these

04:06:26.160 --> 04:06:28.890
securities back from the

04:06:31.600 --> 04:06:34.210
Central Bank at a higher

04:06:34.220 --> 04:06:35.310
price.

04:06:35.930 --> 04:06:38.530
The price difference is the percentage

04:06:38.540 --> 04:06:40.790
that the central bank

04:06:40.800 --> 04:06:42.850
receives from commercial banks.

04:06:42.860 --> 04:06:46.400
But still, with the associative operation

04:06:46.410 --> 04:06:49.480
of direct REPO, the Central Bank

04:06:49.490 --> 04:06:51.680
increases the money mass in the economy.

04:06:53.420 --> 04:06:55.780
And with the reverse REPO operation, everything

04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:57.020
happens the opposite.

04:06:57.520 --> 04:07:01.420
The central bank temporarily

04:07:01.430 --> 04:07:03.400
sells its state securities

04:07:03.410 --> 04:07:05.400
to commercial banks.

04:07:06.640 --> 04:07:09.160
And when he sells them, he temporarily

04:07:09.170 --> 04:07:11.460
pulls the money out of the

04:07:11.470 --> 04:07:14.340
economy, reduces the money out.

04:07:18.330 --> 04:07:20.610
The second instrument of purchase is the sale

04:07:20.620 --> 04:07:22.430
of foreign currency.

04:07:25.080 --> 04:07:27.440
But here is essentially the same mechanism.

04:07:30.250 --> 04:07:32.350
If the central bank buys dollars

04:07:32.360 --> 04:07:35.350
or euros, it emits rubles

04:07:35.360 --> 04:07:36.810
in response.

04:07:40.100 --> 04:07:41.720
As a result, the money mass in the

04:07:41.730 --> 04:07:42.920
economy is increasing.

04:07:43.440 --> 04:07:45.040
Well, imagine, I am the Central Bank, you

04:07:45.050 --> 04:07:46.220
are a commercial bank, you sell me currency,

04:07:46.230 --> 04:07:48.200
you give me currency, I give you

04:07:48.210 --> 04:07:49.620
rubles.

04:07:49.900 --> 04:07:52.080
As a result, the money mass

04:07:52.090 --> 04:07:52.740
is increasing.

04:07:54.500 --> 04:07:58.180
On the contrary, when the central bank

04:08:00.460 --> 04:08:02.160
sells currency to commercial

04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:07.120
banks, it pulls rubles out of

04:08:08.930 --> 04:08:12.000
the economy, that is, the money mass decreases.

04:08:14.120 --> 04:08:17.620
The third instrument is the change

04:08:19.780 --> 04:08:22.500
of the mandatory reserve rate.

04:08:28.360 --> 04:08:30.680
What is a compulsory reserve standard?

04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:35.730
Let's say commercial banks

04:08:35.740 --> 04:08:39.750
are attracting funds from depositors.

04:08:39.760 --> 04:08:42.530
They cannot all these attracted funds

04:08:42.540 --> 04:08:44.490
to let business turnaround.

04:08:44.810 --> 04:08:46.910
For example, allow for loans.

04:08:50.750 --> 04:08:54.990
They are obliged to reserve part

04:08:55.000 --> 04:08:57.230
of the funds attracted at

04:08:57.240 --> 04:08:58.490
the Central Bank.

04:08:59.790 --> 04:09:03.090
Accordingly, the higher the

04:09:03.100 --> 04:09:06.690
mandatory reserve rate, the

04:09:06.700 --> 04:09:09.730
less the commercial banks

04:09:09.740 --> 04:09:11.810
have funds to issue loans.

04:09:13.600 --> 04:09:16.160
And I have already told you that all

04:09:16.170 --> 04:09:17.780
kinds of expenses commercial banks give

04:09:17.790 --> 04:09:19.780
out loans, opening current accounts

04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:22.260
to borrowers, they increase the

04:09:22.270 --> 04:09:23.340
money mass in the economy.

04:09:25.140 --> 04:09:26.820
The higher the mandatory reserve

04:09:26.830 --> 04:09:29.160
rate, the less the money

04:09:29.170 --> 04:09:30.700
in the economy.

04:09:30.920 --> 04:09:31.820
And the opposite.

04:09:34.900 --> 04:09:36.060
The fourth instrument.

04:09:37.920 --> 04:09:41.680
Changes in interest rates on deposits

04:09:41.690 --> 04:09:44.080
of commercial banks in the

04:09:44.090 --> 04:09:44.840
Central Bank.

04:09:47.530 --> 04:09:48.970
How does this tool work?

04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:53.270
I have already said that commercial

04:09:53.280 --> 04:09:56.570
banks are obliged to reserve part

04:09:56.580 --> 04:09:58.350
of the funds attracted in

04:09:58.360 --> 04:09:59.290
the Central Bank.

04:10:02.100 --> 04:10:04.000
But, say, the central bank

04:10:04.010 --> 04:10:06.860
wants commercial banks to hold

04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:09.020
more money in the

04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:10.280
central bank.

04:10:12.890 --> 04:10:14.750
On the one hand, can he do anything?

04:10:16.270 --> 04:10:19.010
Increase the mandatory reserve rate.

04:10:22.800 --> 04:10:24.540
However, central banks rarely

04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:26.380
use this tool.

04:10:26.390 --> 04:10:29.320
What is this tool bad?

04:10:30.100 --> 04:10:33.600
He cuts all the banks under one scarf.

04:10:34.540 --> 04:10:36.240
There is no separate reserve

04:10:36.250 --> 04:10:38.520
rate for Sberbank and no separate

04:10:38.530 --> 04:10:40.100
for Alpha Bank.

04:10:40.360 --> 04:10:41.420
She is the same for everyone.

04:10:43.490 --> 04:10:45.230
What if he doesn't want to cut them under

04:10:45.240 --> 04:10:46.010
one hammer?

04:10:46.930 --> 04:10:50.810
What can the central bank offer?

04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:55.590
He may offer commercial banks

04:10:55.600 --> 04:10:58.890
on a voluntary basis to

04:10:58.900 --> 04:11:01.830
open additional depository

04:11:01.840 --> 04:11:04.370
accounts, on which he pays

04:11:04.380 --> 04:11:05.230
interest.

04:11:06.530 --> 04:11:08.210
The central bank, the commercial

04:11:08.220 --> 04:11:09.450
bank, does not pay interest

04:11:09.460 --> 04:11:11.390
on the obligatory reserves.

04:11:11.530 --> 04:11:12.310
So throughout the world.

04:11:13.430 --> 04:11:15.450
But on deposits, which are

04:11:15.530 --> 04:11:16.550
opened on a voluntary

04:11:16.560 --> 04:11:18.790
basis, the central bank pays,

04:11:18.800 --> 04:11:20.430
even if small, but still

04:11:20.440 --> 04:11:22.590
a percentage.

04:11:26.500 --> 04:11:28.120
How much higher is this percentage?

04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.930
by what?

04:11:32.490 --> 04:11:34.870
The more of their funds commercial

04:11:35.150 --> 04:11:36.670
banks hold on the deposit

04:11:36.680 --> 04:11:38.690
account of the central banks.

04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:40.230
The less they can

04:11:40.240 --> 04:11:42.250
lend.

04:11:44.000 --> 04:11:45.800
And I have said that whenever

04:11:46.740 --> 04:11:47.660
commercial banks lend, they

04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:48.880
increase the money mass in

04:11:48.890 --> 04:11:49.820
the economy.

04:11:50.040 --> 04:11:51.680
The less money in the economy.

04:11:51.690 --> 04:11:52.360


04:11:54.810 --> 04:11:56.290
The fifth instrument.

04:11:57.590 --> 04:12:01.950
Changes in the accounting rate

04:12:01.960 --> 04:12:04.070
or refinancing rate.

04:12:07.060 --> 04:12:08.540
In the West, it is a very important

04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:10.880
tool for regulating the money mass

04:12:10.890 --> 04:12:12.180
in the economy.

04:12:14.090 --> 04:12:18.310
Accounting rate is the rate

04:12:18.320 --> 04:12:22.410
at which Western central banks

04:12:22.420 --> 04:12:24.310
lend commercial.

04:12:24.850 --> 04:12:26.490
Well, let them lend not at an accounting

04:12:26.500 --> 04:12:28.310
rate, but at a rate very close

04:12:28.320 --> 04:12:30.370
to the accounting rate.

04:12:32.460 --> 04:12:33.580
So what does it work out?

04:12:35.560 --> 04:12:39.740
The lower the accounting rate,

04:12:39.750 --> 04:12:42.720
the more loans commercial banks

04:12:42.730 --> 04:12:46.800
can take from the central bank,

04:12:49.800 --> 04:12:53.940
the more loans they give

04:12:56.620 --> 04:12:59.790
themselves, the more money in

04:12:59.800 --> 04:13:01.150
the economy.

04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:03.950
The accounting rate determines

04:13:03.960 --> 04:13:09.100
a lot in Western countries.

04:13:09.620 --> 04:13:13.180
If it decreases, then the interest

04:13:13.340 --> 04:13:16.160
rate in the economy also decreases.

04:13:17.970 --> 04:13:19.970
A lot depends on interest

04:13:19.980 --> 04:13:21.930
rates.

04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:24.090
And investment, and consumption, and the exchange

04:13:24.100 --> 04:13:25.810
rate of the national currency, and much more.

04:13:27.860 --> 04:13:32.580
Therefore, any change in the accounting

04:13:32.590 --> 04:13:34.760
rate or even rumors about a possible

04:13:34.770 --> 04:13:37.200
change attract increased attention

04:13:37.210 --> 04:13:39.320
of all financiers.

04:13:42.080 --> 04:13:44.860
There is no accounting rate

04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:45.780
in Russia.

04:13:46.780 --> 04:13:49.320
We have a refinancing rate.

04:13:53.690 --> 04:13:56.830
The difference is quite significant.

04:13:57.110 --> 04:14:00.110
I have said that in the West,

04:14:00.120 --> 04:14:02.030
central banks lend commercial

04:14:02.040 --> 04:14:04.270
banks at a rate very close to the

04:14:04.280 --> 04:14:05.110
accounting rate.

04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:12.130
In Russia, the central bank does

04:14:12.140 --> 04:14:14.450
not lend commercial banks at the

04:14:14.460 --> 04:14:15.970
refinancing rate.

04:14:16.450 --> 04:14:20.010
Today, the refinancing rate is

04:14:20.020 --> 04:14:21.750
ten and a half percent of

04:14:21.760 --> 04:14:22.890
the annual rate.

04:14:24.490 --> 04:14:26.390
Commercial banks lend the central

04:14:26.400 --> 04:14:30.190
bank at six with a small

04:14:30.200 --> 04:14:30.990
interest rate.

04:14:31.190 --> 04:14:32.470
At an annual interest rate of

04:14:32.480 --> 04:14:33.750
six with a small percentage.

04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:42.910
The refinancing rate is not so much

04:14:42.920 --> 04:14:44.970
a tool for regulating

04:14:45.210 --> 04:14:47.670
the money mass in the economy,

04:14:47.680 --> 04:14:50.290
but an indicator of the reduction

04:14:50.300 --> 04:14:52.150
of interest rates.

04:14:54.150 --> 04:14:55.070
Looks are what.

04:14:56.820 --> 04:14:59.140
Interbank market interest

04:14:59.150 --> 04:15:01.380
rates are falling along with

04:15:02.960 --> 04:15:05.840
the decrease in inflation.

04:15:08.020 --> 04:15:11.280
The central bank also reduces

04:15:11.290 --> 04:15:14.060
the refinancing rate.

04:15:16.440 --> 04:15:19.760
That is, the refinancing rate does not

04:15:19.770 --> 04:15:21.520
so much determine the market interest

04:15:21.530 --> 04:15:24.340
rates, it is always higher than them.

04:15:24.940 --> 04:15:27.420
How much followed him, after them.

04:15:28.200 --> 04:15:29.620
It is not so much

04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:31.540
a tool, but an indicator.

04:15:33.600 --> 04:15:36.940
I repeat the reduction in refinancing rates.

04:15:38.430 --> 04:15:41.200
It is said to be an indicator

04:15:41.210 --> 04:15:43.700
of the decline in interest rates

04:15:43.710 --> 04:15:45.220
in the economy.

04:15:48.760 --> 04:15:50.520
In the future, the refinancing

04:15:53.240 --> 04:15:55.840
rate may become a monetary

04:15:55.850 --> 04:15:59.340
policy instrument.

04:16:01.380 --> 04:16:02.740
But for this it needs to be reduced,

04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:04.360
visible.

04:16:07.020 --> 04:16:08.260
And the central bank

04:16:08.270 --> 04:16:10.260
really has to give out credit.

04:16:13.970 --> 04:16:15.170
The sixth instrument.

04:16:16.410 --> 04:16:18.990
The placement of central bank

04:16:19.000 --> 04:16:21.590
bonds among commercial banks.

04:16:25.620 --> 04:16:27.280
What a logic.

04:16:27.680 --> 04:16:30.160
The central bank can sell

04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:31.920
its own bonds to a

04:16:31.930 --> 04:16:33.400
commercial bank.

04:16:33.410 --> 04:16:34.960
The Bank of Russia.

04:16:36.920 --> 04:16:39.700
The same mechanism is already known.

04:16:39.740 --> 04:16:41.520
When a central bank sells its

04:16:41.530 --> 04:16:43.080
bonds to a commercial bank,

04:16:43.090 --> 04:16:46.540
it receives money in exchange.

04:16:46.720 --> 04:16:48.900
It pulls money out of the economy.

04:16:49.520 --> 04:16:51.660
When he buys his bonds back from

04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:53.420
commercial banks, he returns the

04:16:53.430 --> 04:16:55.040
money mass to the economy,

04:16:55.050 --> 04:16:56.180
that is, increases the

04:16:56.190 --> 04:16:57.120
money mass.

04:16:59.480 --> 04:17:02.480
The seventh instrument is the regulation of funds on the accounts

04:17:02.490 --> 04:17:05.240
of the Ministry of Finance in the Central Bank.

04:17:05.320 --> 04:17:06.260
The Central Bank.

04:17:09.000 --> 04:17:11.260
We have said that on the one hand, the government

04:17:11.270 --> 04:17:14.910
of the Ministry of Finance collects

04:17:14.920 --> 04:17:17.670
taxes, on the other hand, considers

04:17:17.710 --> 04:17:19.030
expenses.

04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:22.190
But if the taxes collected more than

04:17:22.210 --> 04:17:24.110
the expenses, the funds on

04:17:24.690 --> 04:17:26.270
the accounts of the Ministry of Finance

04:17:26.280 --> 04:17:28.450
in the Central Bank increases, so

04:17:29.930 --> 04:17:34.050
the money is withdrawn from the economy.

04:17:36.390 --> 04:17:38.050
How does money become less in the economy?

04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:40.570
When the balance of the account of the Ministry

04:17:44.300 --> 04:17:49.570
of Finance in the Central Bank decreases,

04:17:49.580 --> 04:17:51.270
the money is returned to the economy.

04:17:52.290 --> 04:17:54.690
But this instrument is not used

04:17:54.700 --> 04:17:57.050
by the Central Bank as much as the Ministry

04:17:57.060 --> 04:17:59.070
of Finance itself.

04:17:59.950 --> 04:18:02.350
It is therefore involved in

04:18:02.360 --> 04:18:05.550
regulating the money mass in the economy.

04:18:08.980 --> 04:18:14.280
I have listed 7 tools.

04:18:14.640 --> 04:18:18.900
The main things we have in our economy, in

04:18:18.920 --> 04:18:22.120
Russia, are for today the purchase and

04:18:22.130 --> 04:18:25.540
sale of foreign currency, the REPO operation,

04:18:29.580 --> 04:18:32.100
which I also talked about, the change

04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:35.720
of the interest rate on deposits of

04:18:35.730 --> 04:18:38.360
commercial banks in the Central Bank

04:18:38.370 --> 04:18:43.310
and the change of the balance on the

04:18:43.320 --> 04:18:46.130
accounts of the Ministry of Finance in

04:18:46.140 --> 04:18:47.010
the Central Bank.

04:18:48.780 --> 04:18:51.580
So again.

04:18:52.640 --> 04:18:55.260
The central bank, using these

04:18:55.270 --> 04:18:58.240
instruments, can either increase

04:18:58.250 --> 04:19:00.840
the money supply in the economy

04:19:00.850 --> 04:19:05.700
or decrease it.

04:19:06.020 --> 04:19:08.520
When does it increase and when does

04:19:08.530 --> 04:19:09.520
it decrease?

04:19:09.820 --> 04:19:11.120
Why Why?

04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:16.890
If the economy is experiencing a crisis,

04:19:19.940 --> 04:19:23.300
if the balance of GDP is less

04:19:23.310 --> 04:19:25.060
than the potential GDP, the economy

04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:27.320
is underloaded, then what should

04:19:27.580 --> 04:19:28.960
the Bank of Russia do?

04:19:30.180 --> 04:19:31.920
Stimulate overall demand by

04:19:31.930 --> 04:19:35.500
increasing the money supply in

04:19:37.210 --> 04:19:41.200
the economy to increase GDP and

04:19:41.210 --> 04:19:43.460
increase employment.

04:19:44.780 --> 04:19:48.280
And if the economy is threatened

04:19:50.230 --> 04:19:53.280
by inflation, the Bank of Russia must

04:19:53.290 --> 04:19:55.940
apply anti-inflationary policy,

04:19:55.950 --> 04:20:01.080
namely to reduce the money

04:20:01.090 --> 04:20:03.500
mass in the economy.

04:20:09.420 --> 04:20:13.020
The central bank of Russia

04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:17.920
has recently established

04:20:17.930 --> 04:20:19.960
an anti-inflation policy.

04:20:20.740 --> 04:20:25.220
But here there is a rather serious

04:20:26.720 --> 04:20:32.090
problem and it is related to the

04:20:32.100 --> 04:20:34.990
high world prices of oil and

04:20:35.000 --> 04:20:35.190
gas.

04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:40.970
Let us reason.

04:20:41.190 --> 04:20:44.230
High global oil and gas prices.

04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:46.730
What does this lead to?

04:20:48.360 --> 04:20:53.940
Foreign currency is introduced into the country.

04:20:55.460 --> 04:20:56.300
For example the dollar.

04:21:01.060 --> 04:21:04.940
If the dollar becomes more in the market,

04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:10.060
in the currency market, then the law of

04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:11.820
any, one for all commodities.

04:21:12.040 --> 04:21:14.820
If there are more products on the market, it will be cheaper.

04:21:15.080 --> 04:21:16.540
So what does the influx of dollars

04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:17.440
lead to?

04:21:21.000 --> 04:21:24.900
The fall of the dollar against

04:21:24.910 --> 04:21:25.720
the ruble.

04:21:26.060 --> 04:21:27.820
Or what is the same?

04:21:30.760 --> 04:21:34.040
The rise of the ruble against

04:21:34.050 --> 04:21:35.220
the dollar.

04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:42.170
So I said that the currency, the

04:21:42.180 --> 04:21:45.290
US dollar, is coming to the Russian currency

04:21:45.300 --> 04:21:46.950
market.

04:21:47.130 --> 04:21:49.850
Dollars are increasing.

04:21:52.600 --> 04:21:55.300
The dollar is cheaper against

04:21:55.310 --> 04:21:56.620
the ruble.

04:21:59.660 --> 04:22:01.020
Or what is the same?

04:22:01.420 --> 04:22:04.200
The ruble is rising against the dollar.

04:22:05.740 --> 04:22:08.200
What should we remember in this regard?

04:22:10.990 --> 04:22:14.150
We must remember the formula of

04:22:14.160 --> 04:22:15.850
the real exchange rate.

04:22:39.190 --> 04:22:39.850
Again once again.

04:22:41.130 --> 04:22:44.470
This is the nominal rate of the ruble

04:22:44.480 --> 04:22:45.470
in US dollars.

04:22:49.310 --> 04:22:53.170
Ruble is now given more dollars.

04:22:54.150 --> 04:22:58.110
The nominal rate of the ruble is rising.

04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:02.690
The ruble is rising against the dollar.

04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:05.950
The dollar is cheaper against the ruble.

04:23:06.010 --> 04:23:07.150
For the ruble, they give more dollars.

04:23:10.780 --> 04:23:13.720
So what is it threatening?

04:23:15.760 --> 04:23:17.560
The real rate of the ruble.

04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:22.670
The real rate of the ruble is

04:23:24.000 --> 04:23:25.040
the price ratio.

04:23:26.120 --> 04:23:27.320
If the real rate of the

04:23:27.330 --> 04:23:31.240
ruble rises, I said, it leads to

04:23:31.250 --> 04:23:33.660
the fact that our goods become

04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:34.860
less competitive

04:23:34.870 --> 04:23:37.720
both in the Russian market

04:23:37.730 --> 04:23:41.280
and in the world markets.

04:23:44.320 --> 04:23:49.680
So our net exports are falling.

04:23:50.260 --> 04:23:52.100
Remember, now let us remember the

04:23:52.110 --> 04:23:53.380
equation of total demand.

04:23:53.560 --> 04:23:54.100
Where is it at us?

04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:08.830
The real rate of the ruble

04:24:08.840 --> 04:24:10.250
rises, the ruble is

04:24:16.500 --> 04:24:20.640
expensive, and net exports fall.

04:24:22.190 --> 04:24:24.050
But net exports are a component

04:24:24.060 --> 04:24:26.570
part of the total demand.

04:24:26.930 --> 04:24:29.850
If it falls, the overall demand

04:24:29.860 --> 04:24:31.650
for our goods decreases.

04:24:35.580 --> 04:24:41.900
This is full of economic problems.

04:24:42.240 --> 04:24:43.700
Economic downturn is full of.

04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:50.750
What can be done to prevent

04:24:50.760 --> 04:24:53.910
such an adverse development?

04:24:55.230 --> 04:25:00.110
The central bank is buying the dollar

04:25:00.120 --> 04:25:02.450
that comes into the country.

04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:09.990
This is to prevent

04:25:10.000 --> 04:25:12.550
the ruble from growing.

04:25:13.090 --> 04:25:14.850
On the one hand, the supply

04:25:14.860 --> 04:25:17.690
of dollars in the Russian currency

04:25:17.700 --> 04:25:19.610
market is growing.

04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:21.690
On the other hand, the demand for dollars

04:25:21.700 --> 04:25:24.590
from the central bank is growing.

04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:28.010
The growth of demand blocked the growth of supply.

04:25:28.270 --> 04:25:30.870
The dollar may not fall in this

04:25:30.880 --> 04:25:31.690
case.

04:25:32.190 --> 04:25:35.050
If it falls, it is not very important.

04:25:35.490 --> 04:25:37.710
Not as it would have fallen if the

04:25:37.720 --> 04:25:38.930
central bank had not intervened.

04:25:44.110 --> 04:25:45.070
All nothing.

04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:49.850
But if the central bank buys

04:25:49.860 --> 04:25:51.590
dollars, we talked about

04:25:51.600 --> 04:25:55.150
it, it imitates rubles.

04:25:56.560 --> 04:25:58.520
It leads.

04:25:58.740 --> 04:26:00.340
I forgot to say.

04:26:00.880 --> 04:26:02.460
When the central bank buys dollars,

04:26:02.470 --> 04:26:07.020
what is the positive side

04:26:07.030 --> 04:26:08.260
of this?

04:26:09.620 --> 04:26:12.860
The central bank's gold reserves

04:26:14.290 --> 04:26:16.720
are increasing.

04:26:20.640 --> 04:26:24.500
Accordingly, we can easily

04:26:26.570 --> 04:26:30.440
quench our debts, external debt,

04:26:30.450 --> 04:26:35.140
and even reserves are increasing.

04:26:35.380 --> 04:26:38.160
Please pay attention to the slide.

04:26:38.300 --> 04:26:39.560
Here you can see the changes

04:26:39.570 --> 04:26:41.280
in the gold and foreign reserves of the

04:26:41.290 --> 04:26:43.960
Bank of Russia in the ninety-eighth, in the

04:26:43.970 --> 04:26:47.060
two thousand-seventh years, in millions of dollars.

04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:50.810
And you see that in the ninety-eighth year

04:26:50.820 --> 04:26:55.810
the gold and foreign reserves of the Bank

04:26:55.820 --> 04:26:58.830
of Russia were very insignificant.

04:26:58.840 --> 04:27:00.310
It can be assumed that they were

04:27:00.320 --> 04:27:04.160
at zero in the early ninety-eighth

04:27:04.170 --> 04:27:06.940
year, and in the ninety-nine,

04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:08.320
in the early ninety-nine years

04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:10.920
at all, we had gold and foreign

04:27:10.930 --> 04:27:13.800
reserves of just twelve

04:27:13.810 --> 04:27:15.400
billion dollars.

04:27:15.520 --> 04:27:16.500
That is very little.

04:27:17.120 --> 04:27:19.760
But gradually, in connection with

04:27:19.770 --> 04:27:21.780
economic growth and high world prices

04:27:21.790 --> 04:27:23.480
for oil and gas, our gold and foreign

04:27:23.490 --> 04:27:25.800
exchange reserves are growing very

04:27:25.810 --> 04:27:28.180
quickly.

04:27:28.340 --> 04:27:32.300
In one year from January 1 of the

04:27:32.310 --> 04:27:34.160
sixth year to January 1 of the

04:27:34.170 --> 04:27:37.120
seventh year, they grew more

04:27:37.130 --> 04:27:39.260
than one and a half times.

04:27:39.600 --> 04:27:40.540
Probably a 60 percent

04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:41.940
is possible.

04:27:42.260 --> 04:27:43.960
And now we have gold

04:27:43.970 --> 04:27:46.460
reserves of $300

04:27:46.470 --> 04:27:47.640
billion.

04:27:49.000 --> 04:27:52.280
Thirty-four a billion dollars.

04:27:53.980 --> 04:27:55.360
Here we can not say exactly on

04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:58.860
gold and currency reserves, but somewhere,

04:27:58.870 --> 04:28:00.820
probably, place in the fourth

04:28:00.830 --> 04:28:03.160
in the world, maybe, on the fifth.

04:28:03.580 --> 04:28:04.840
We are now in good shape with

04:28:04.850 --> 04:28:05.980
our gold reserves.

04:28:07.730 --> 04:28:10.350
But what is bad?

04:28:10.750 --> 04:28:14.390
By buying currency, by increasing

04:28:14.400 --> 04:28:16.390
its gold and foreign reserves,

04:28:16.400 --> 04:28:17.510
the Bank of Russia, as I said,

04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:19.730
emits rubles.

04:28:23.890 --> 04:28:26.730
So what is increasing?

04:28:28.490 --> 04:28:32.230
The ruble money in our economy.

04:28:34.840 --> 04:28:37.660
Let us now look at the quantitative

04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:39.340
theory of money equation of

04:28:39.350 --> 04:28:41.820
the IMPU.

04:28:55.480 --> 04:28:56.340
What happens?

04:29:00.480 --> 04:29:04.580
The money volume in the economy is growing rapidly.

04:29:08.180 --> 04:29:09.400
Let the speed of money circulation

04:29:09.410 --> 04:29:11.700
be known at the moment, but the

04:29:11.710 --> 04:29:13.860
money mass is growing.

04:29:14.380 --> 04:29:17.340
The growth of money mass is significantly

04:29:17.350 --> 04:29:20.880
ahead of the growth of real GDP.

04:29:25.190 --> 04:29:27.360
What is it filled?

04:29:27.500 --> 04:29:28.680
of inflation.

04:29:30.250 --> 04:29:32.670
With the same negative consequences.

04:29:34.830 --> 04:29:35.990
What must be done?

04:29:38.290 --> 04:29:41.210
The central bank and the

04:29:41.220 --> 04:29:43.950
Ministry of Finance must

04:29:43.960 --> 04:29:46.670
sterilize excess liquidity.

04:29:47.930 --> 04:29:51.930
Bind rubles that are not needed for the economy.

04:29:54.580 --> 04:29:57.580
I would like to emphasize again that

04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:59.860
money is like water.

04:30:00.340 --> 04:30:02.480
Money should not be much or little,

04:30:02.490 --> 04:30:04.660
but exactly as much as the

04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:06.720
economy needs to digest this

04:30:06.730 --> 04:30:11.440
money and turn it into

04:30:11.450 --> 04:30:12.760
real GDP.

04:30:13.760 --> 04:30:16.580
If there is more money, what

04:30:18.560 --> 04:30:19.460
should I do?

04:30:20.900 --> 04:30:24.380
You need to connect excess money.

04:30:24.900 --> 04:30:29.280
Otherwise, price increases are inevitable.

04:30:37.480 --> 04:30:42.000
That is what he actually does.

04:30:42.440 --> 04:30:45.620
This is done by the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance.

04:30:46.060 --> 04:30:48.060
That is, I want to emphasize that

04:30:48.070 --> 04:30:51.340
the high world oil prices create

04:30:51.350 --> 04:30:54.740
very serious problems in

04:30:54.750 --> 04:30:58.770
implementing monetary and anti-

04:30:58.780 --> 04:31:00.970
inflation policy, and difficulties

04:31:01.630 --> 04:31:02.650
in implementing monetary

04:31:02.660 --> 04:31:05.570
and anti-inflation policy.

04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:11.670
So, the last question of our

04:31:11.680 --> 04:31:13.830
last topic.

04:31:14.190 --> 04:31:16.490
Transfer mechanism and

04:31:16.500 --> 04:31:18.470
monetary policy effectiveness.

04:31:21.400 --> 04:31:24.480
I would like to repeat once again

04:31:24.490 --> 04:31:27.260
that monetary policy is important not

04:31:27.270 --> 04:31:31.260
in itself, but as a means of influencing

04:31:31.270 --> 04:31:33.360
macroeconomic indicators.

04:31:37.860 --> 04:31:42.760
The transfer mechanism

04:31:42.770 --> 04:31:45.320
by which the money mass

04:31:45.330 --> 04:31:48.300
affects macroeconomic

04:31:48.310 --> 04:31:50.540
indicators is called the

04:31:51.220 --> 04:31:55.240
money transmission mechanism.

04:31:57.120 --> 04:31:59.320
In this mechanism, the following

04:31:59.330 --> 04:32:02.360
main elements can be identified.

04:32:03.980 --> 04:32:05.480
Please look at the slide.

04:32:08.040 --> 04:32:10.120
What can the central bank

04:32:10.130 --> 04:32:11.860
do first?

04:32:12.080 --> 04:32:16.620
It can change the monetary base and the

04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:18.400
money mass in the economy.

04:32:21.640 --> 04:32:27.060
Further, the change in the money mass

04:32:27.070 --> 04:32:29.480
affects the change in the real

04:32:29.490 --> 04:32:30.740
interest rate.

04:32:32.980 --> 04:32:35.420
A change in the real interest

04:32:35.430 --> 04:32:39.140
rate affects a change in the

04:32:39.150 --> 04:32:40.480
overall demand.

04:32:42.000 --> 04:32:45.580
And finally, the change in total

04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:48.460
demand affects the change

04:32:48.470 --> 04:32:49.540
in real GDP.

04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:56.550
This may not be a very simple

04:32:56.560 --> 04:32:59.350
transmission mechanism.

04:33:02.970 --> 04:33:07.750
Let's say the economy is going down.

04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:10.190
The balanced GDP is actually less

04:33:10.710 --> 04:33:12.330
than the potential GDP.

04:33:15.300 --> 04:33:16.980
What to do with the central bank?

04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:23.750
In this case, it should conduct

04:33:23.790 --> 04:33:26.550
a stimulating monetary policy or,

04:33:26.710 --> 04:33:29.950
they say, a policy of cheap money.

04:33:32.570 --> 04:33:35.310
Stimulating monetary policy is

04:33:35.320 --> 04:33:37.550
monetary policy aimed at

04:33:37.560 --> 04:33:40.030
increasing overall demand

04:33:40.040 --> 04:33:43.090
in conditions where the balanced

04:33:43.370 --> 04:33:46.590
GDP is less than the potential.

04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:51.890
Please look at the slide.

04:33:52.210 --> 04:33:55.590
If a stimulating monetary policy

04:33:55.600 --> 04:33:59.010
is applied, the mechanism of monetary

04:33:59.020 --> 04:34:00.730
transmission looks like this.

04:34:03.940 --> 04:34:07.340
The central bank increases the monetary

04:34:07.350 --> 04:34:11.890
base, which leads to the increase of

04:34:11.900 --> 04:34:14.710
the money supply.

04:34:14.790 --> 04:34:17.990
The growth of the money mass in the

04:34:18.000 --> 04:34:20.210
economy leads to a decrease

04:34:20.220 --> 04:34:22.710
in the real interest rate,

04:34:22.720 --> 04:34:24.350
money becomes more, money

04:34:24.360 --> 04:34:26.390
becomes cheaper.

04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:28.190
The real interest rate is

04:34:28.200 --> 04:34:29.130
getting lower.

04:34:31.080 --> 04:34:33.740
The reduction of the real

04:34:33.820 --> 04:34:35.740
interest rate leads to the

04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:41.220
increase of expenses sensitive

04:34:41.230 --> 04:34:44.480
to change, to its change.

04:34:45.480 --> 04:34:47.040
What are the costs that

04:34:47.050 --> 04:34:47.980
are sensitive to the change

04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:49.140
in the real interest rate?

04:34:52.610 --> 04:34:54.710
These are household consumer

04:34:54.720 --> 04:34:57.690
expenses and company investment

04:34:57.700 --> 04:34:59.350
expenses.

04:35:07.220 --> 04:35:10.420
So costs are growing, and overall

04:35:10.430 --> 04:35:11.680
demand is growing.

04:35:13.200 --> 04:35:15.560
The growth of overall demand contributes

04:35:16.600 --> 04:35:18.600
to the growth of GDP.

04:35:20.060 --> 04:35:23.520
Please see the following slide.

04:35:23.720 --> 04:35:26.020
Stimulating monetary policy and

04:35:26.030 --> 04:35:28.040
changes in GDP.

04:35:31.530 --> 04:35:32.430
What do we see?

04:35:33.530 --> 04:35:37.390
On the left and on the right diagrams.

04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:44.770
And there, and there, due to the increase of

04:35:44.780 --> 04:35:47.050
the money mass in the economy, the

04:35:47.060 --> 04:35:49.710
overall demand is growing.

04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:51.730
The combined demand curve is shifting

04:35:53.620 --> 04:35:56.780
to the right, but the results are

04:35:59.580 --> 04:36:00.840
exactly the opposite.

04:36:02.480 --> 04:36:04.240
What do we see on the left picture?

04:36:06.500 --> 04:36:10.350
There we have a short-term curve

04:36:10.360 --> 04:36:12.410
of the total offer horizontally.

04:36:13.270 --> 04:36:16.030
This means that companies can increase

04:36:16.040 --> 04:36:19.230
output in response to the growth of

04:36:19.240 --> 04:36:22.410
overall demand without rising prices.

04:36:23.810 --> 04:36:26.750
In this case, monetary, stimulating

04:36:26.870 --> 04:36:28.790
monetary policy is quite

04:36:28.800 --> 04:36:29.970
effective.

04:36:31.360 --> 04:36:33.500
What do we see in the right picture?

04:36:34.970 --> 04:36:38.110
The balance of GDP has reached

04:36:38.120 --> 04:36:39.790
its potential level.

04:36:40.430 --> 04:36:42.930
In this case, it is pointless

04:36:42.940 --> 04:36:45.190
to conduct a stimulating policy.

04:36:46.710 --> 04:36:48.610
Growth in production, if any, will only

04:36:48.790 --> 04:36:50.290
occur in a very short period of time.

04:36:52.110 --> 04:36:54.650
What will the economy quickly get back to?

04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:57.830
GDP at higher prices.

04:36:57.840 --> 04:36:59.170


04:36:59.290 --> 04:37:02.170
We will only get inflation.

04:37:05.000 --> 04:37:10.200
I was talking about incentive policy.

04:37:10.680 --> 04:37:12.600
A stimulating monetary policy.

04:37:17.840 --> 04:37:20.460
However, the central bank often

04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:23.040
conducts not a stimulating but

04:37:23.050 --> 04:37:25.240
a deterrent monetary policy.

04:37:28.760 --> 04:37:30.140
When does he resort to her?

04:37:33.050 --> 04:37:34.990
It is used when the economy is not

04:37:35.790 --> 04:37:39.730
threatened by a decline, but by

04:37:40.110 --> 04:37:41.170
inflation.

04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.930
The price increase.

04:37:43.660 --> 04:37:46.600
In this case, the central bank should

04:37:46.610 --> 04:37:48.340
not stimulate the overall demand,

04:37:48.350 --> 04:37:50.820
but rather contain it.

04:37:51.340 --> 04:37:54.600
A deterrent monetary policy, or the

04:37:54.780 --> 04:37:56.600
policy of expensive money,

04:37:56.610 --> 04:37:59.180
is aimed at limiting the

04:37:59.190 --> 04:38:01.520
aggregate demand by reducing

04:38:01.530 --> 04:38:03.460
the money supply in the economy.

04:38:06.600 --> 04:38:08.980
So if the central bank is holding

04:38:14.370 --> 04:38:16.390
back, carries out a deterrent monetary

04:38:16.400 --> 04:38:18.910
policy, it thus limits the growth

04:38:18.920 --> 04:38:22.130
of the aggregate demand.

04:38:24.220 --> 04:38:28.260
As a result, inflation is slowing down.

04:38:30.800 --> 04:38:33.000
But it is in principle monetary

04:38:33.010 --> 04:38:36.420
policy, either deterrent

04:38:45.080 --> 04:38:48.890
or stimulating, which is often

04:38:48.900 --> 04:38:52.130
applied by central banks.

04:38:52.890 --> 04:38:54.070
I repeat again.

04:39:00.260 --> 04:39:03.720
If the economy is threatened with a decline,

04:39:03.730 --> 04:39:06.660
then we must conduct a stimulating

04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:08.180
policy, increase the money supply

04:39:08.190 --> 04:39:10.180
in the economy, so that the

04:39:10.190 --> 04:39:12.680
overall demand and production grow.

04:39:13.500 --> 04:39:15.040
What if the economy is threatened by

04:39:15.050 --> 04:39:16.820
another threat?

04:39:17.240 --> 04:39:18.260
The inflation.

04:39:19.340 --> 04:39:20.940
On the contrary, central banks

04:39:20.950 --> 04:39:24.180
conduct a deterrent monetary

04:39:25.980 --> 04:39:28.270
policy to limit the overall

04:39:30.920 --> 04:39:32.990
demand in order to fight

04:39:33.000 --> 04:39:34.870
inflation.

04:39:36.370 --> 04:39:39.930
Well, to finish, I would like to

04:39:39.940 --> 04:39:44.210
stop at this is what problem.

04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:50.950
One of the leading economics schools

04:39:50.960 --> 04:39:55.610
of modern times is the

04:39:55.620 --> 04:39:57.390
Monetary School.

04:40:01.140 --> 04:40:02.640
of Monetaryism.

04:40:03.680 --> 04:40:05.700
I said that the leader

04:40:05.710 --> 04:40:07.440
of the monetarist school is

04:40:07.450 --> 04:40:08.820
the recently deceased Nobel Prize

04:40:09.120 --> 04:40:11.300
laureate, Milton Friedman.

04:40:14.300 --> 04:40:17.540
Literally, monetaryism in translation into

04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:20.260
Russian can be said monetaryism.

04:40:22.290 --> 04:40:26.430
The monetarist's slogan is money.

04:40:31.260 --> 04:40:35.120
Monetaries see the change in the

04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:40.140
money mass as the most important

04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:43.020
factor affecting all macroeconomic indicators.

04:40:48.500 --> 04:40:49.500
But that is what matters.

04:40:50.710 --> 04:40:53.010
Monetaries, I have already told you,

04:40:55.940 --> 04:40:58.940
the stubborn marketers, they oppose

04:40:58.950 --> 04:41:01.340
the arbitrary interference of the

04:41:01.350 --> 04:41:03.120
state in the economy.

04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:10.120
I like this Milton

04:41:10.130 --> 04:41:13.180
Friedman.

04:41:15.280 --> 04:41:17.900
I don't literally remember, I can only explain

04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:18.880
the point.

04:41:25.650 --> 04:41:28.750
The state is not the driver,

04:41:28.760 --> 04:41:31.810
it is the passenger in a car with power.

04:41:32.890 --> 04:41:35.590
And it is not allowed for

04:41:35.600 --> 04:41:37.710
a passenger with authority to

04:41:37.790 --> 04:41:38.670
catch the driver.

04:41:40.610 --> 04:41:42.150
The car will quickly fly into the quarter.

04:41:47.550 --> 04:41:49.970
Thus, recognizing the importance

04:41:49.980 --> 04:41:53.250
of monetary policy as the most important

04:41:55.680 --> 04:41:59.010
regulator of the economy, the monetarists

04:41:59.020 --> 04:42:01.770
oppose the arbitrary monetary

04:42:01.780 --> 04:42:03.710
policy of the state.

04:42:04.430 --> 04:42:06.930
They believe that it is wrong if

04:42:06.940 --> 04:42:09.570
the state, based on some of its

04:42:09.580 --> 04:42:11.250
seven-minute interests, today

04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:12.590
increases the money mass,

04:42:12.600 --> 04:42:14.210
tomorrow decreases.

04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:23.010
They have another recommendation.

04:42:26.350 --> 04:42:28.350
The basic equation of monetarism, which

04:42:28.590 --> 04:42:32.370
I have repeatedly mentioned, is the

04:42:32.380 --> 04:42:35.810
equation of quantitative theory of money.

04:42:38.660 --> 04:42:41.240
So, as I just said, the basic

04:42:41.460 --> 04:42:44.940
equation of monetarism is the equation

04:42:44.950 --> 04:42:46.600
of quantitative money theory.

04:42:47.240 --> 04:42:48.920
Let us look at this

04:42:48.930 --> 04:42:50.220
equation again.

04:43:07.860 --> 04:43:11.540
Monetaries try to predict the speed

04:43:11.620 --> 04:43:13.520
of money circulation.

04:43:15.960 --> 04:43:19.860
And they advocate that the money

04:43:19.870 --> 04:43:24.040
mass in the economy does not change

04:43:24.050 --> 04:43:26.980
arbitrarily by the state from month

04:43:26.990 --> 04:43:29.360
to month or from year to year.

04:43:30.180 --> 04:43:31.420
More then less.

04:43:32.380 --> 04:43:35.220
And that the state, the government, announce

04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:40.340
in advance the stable annual growth

04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:43.200
of the money mass in the economy,

04:43:43.210 --> 04:43:45.940
that the Central Bank, more precisely,

04:43:45.950 --> 04:43:47.600
announce the stable annual

04:43:47.610 --> 04:43:52.220
growth of the money mass in the economy.

04:43:52.500 --> 04:43:54.800
What is this stable growth?

04:43:56.640 --> 04:44:00.000
This steady growth should be consistent

04:44:00.010 --> 04:44:02.320
with the growth of the

04:44:02.330 --> 04:44:04.000
potential GDP.

04:44:06.060 --> 04:44:07.820
The potential GDP

04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:09.540
increases naturally from year

04:44:09.550 --> 04:44:10.180
to year.

04:44:11.000 --> 04:44:11.480
Why is?

04:44:16.120 --> 04:44:19.040
The population is growing, the accumulated

04:44:19.050 --> 04:44:22.120
capital is growing, new technical weights

04:44:22.130 --> 04:44:23.400
are being introduced.

04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:30.990
And the growth of potential

04:44:38.720 --> 04:44:41.660
GDP is 3-5% per year.

04:44:44.260 --> 04:44:47.580
What is the role of the state

04:44:47.660 --> 04:44:51.650
to adapt to this growth?

04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:55.950
Increase the money supply in accordance

04:44:55.960 --> 04:44:57.470
with the growth of the

04:44:57.480 --> 04:44:58.690
potential GDP.

04:45:01.240 --> 04:45:04.040
The central bank

04:45:04.050 --> 04:45:07.240
will not hinder the economy.

04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:13.430
If the money mass grows at the same

04:45:13.440 --> 04:45:16.570
rate as the potential GDP, then the

04:45:16.950 --> 04:45:21.270
actual GDP will always be the same

04:45:21.280 --> 04:45:23.730
as the potential GDP.

04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:30.330
The task of the state is only to announce

04:45:31.790 --> 04:45:34.550
once and for all a steady increase

04:45:34.560 --> 04:45:38.130
in the annual money supply in accordance

04:45:38.140 --> 04:45:39.670
with the growth of the

04:45:39.680 --> 04:45:41.010
potential GDP.

04:45:42.800 --> 04:45:45.900
The rest will be done by the market.

04:45:52.420 --> 04:45:55.980
Prices will be stable.

04:45:59.270 --> 04:46:00.010
Thanks for attention.
