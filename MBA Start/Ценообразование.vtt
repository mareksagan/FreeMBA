00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.160
Hi to.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.920
My name is Andrei Kulinch and we

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.020
are starting to consider the price setting.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.480
What is Price?

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.060
In value-appropriate price - is the

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.040
total amount of benefits from the

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.700
product or service you offer.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.480
Benefits are both material

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.440
and intangible benefits divided by

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.340
the total amount of the purchaser's

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.720
costs, both monetary and

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.680
non-monetary.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.360
Costs are often understood, including

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.040
the cost of changing the finished

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.600
products according to the

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200
characteristics of the new supplier.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.340
Changes in the usual mode

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.300
of consumption or use of goods.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.900
Costs related to staff training

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.040
etc.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.900
The price.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.840
The only element of

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.120
the marketing mix that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.120
generates profit, while the rest

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.400
determine the company’s costs.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.580
Price is also the most flexible element

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.940
and, unlike product characteristics

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.520
and marketing channels,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.400
it can be changed

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.320
quickly.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.500
Price competition is one of the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.780
major problems of most companies.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.540
The role of price in the marketing mix

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.780
when increasing is quite difficult.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.620
We have already said that price is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.820
the only thing that shapes the company’

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.640
s profit, everything else is

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.420
the cost.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.100
Price transforms value created

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.880
for the consumer into

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.720
revenue.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.660
Price is one of the most flexible elements,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.400
it is easier to change by changing

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.380
the position of the company in the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.000
market.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.440
The price indicates the market value

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.260
of your brand or product.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.540
The perception of price and quality

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.280
are very closely linked, and we will

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.200
talk about it a little later.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.160
Price is one of the most important criteria

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.140
for consumer choice.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.100
Price determines your market share and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.380
sales growth rate.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.320
Price is not just what is drawn

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.840
on the price list or in the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.500
price sheet.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.560
Price - these are credit terms, discounts

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.760
with which you deliver the goods, flexibility

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.940
in pricing depending on the volumes

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.760
or other conditions of purchase of the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.460
goods, these are geographical parameters,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.320
that is, how the price depends on the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.560
particular region of the sale of the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.900
goods, this is the starting

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.220
price and possible steps to reduce

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.420
it, this is the time of payment

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.640
and much more.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.840
All these parameters form the understanding

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.800
of the concept of price.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.400
If we talk about pricing, it is important

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.960
to understand first of all the company’

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.760
s goals, what we are focusing

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.840
on, what is most relevant

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.600
for the company at the moment.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.660
If we focus on profit, then as

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.320
a rule, this is the target income,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.780
and based on it we already form

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.820
the price for our product or

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.340
service.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.980
If we focus on sales, then our

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.740
goals are to increase market

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.760
share and increase sales

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.720
volumes.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.120
This is a different approach

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.420
to pricing.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.260
Another goal may be to focus

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.220
onining status quo, that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100
is, your position in the market.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.880


00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.260
Accordingly, we focus on counter-

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.300
competition and not price

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.700
competition with our

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.440
partner, if so, on

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.320
the market.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.040
The price of the company is influenced

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.900
by both external and internal

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.780
factors.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.920
Internal factors include the company’

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.880
s goals and strategy, the company’s marketing

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.680
goals, the level of costs associated

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.440
with the production of products

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.720
or the provision of services,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.840
as well as the ways of managing

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.300
the company, because they also

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.300
significantly affect the value

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.760
of the product in terms of costs.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.260
The external factor should include

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.680
the type of competition that exists in

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.880
the market, the prices and offers

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.440
of competitors, as well as their activity,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.360
the characteristics of demand, in

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.720
particular, price elasticity, who participates

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.120
in the promotion, or in the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.400
movement of the goods from the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.220
manufacturer to the final consumer,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.560
namely participants from the household

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.620
channel, as well as environmental

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.980
factors, in particular,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.820
the solvency of the population.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.460
Value-forming strategies can

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.500
differ in two axes.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.840
Pay attention to the slide.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.980
In particular, we consider the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.480
value-forming strategy in axes –

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.440
price and product quality.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.240
Of course, the most

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.560
optimal is the strategy.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.720
High quality – high price.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.680
The premium price strategy.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.500
Average quality – Average price is

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.440
a strategy of average price.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480
Low quality – low price – is

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.120
a strategy of saving.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.540
However, there may be other variations.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.440
For example, the average price is high quality.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.520
This is a high price

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.560
strategy.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.700
That is, we try to be similar or

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.720
justify our offers in the market

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.120
for the consumer.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.920
It can be low quality, high

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.120
price.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.700
This is called the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.460
price theft strategy.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.200
Pricing depends on the

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.740
positioning of your company.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.840
We will touch on this a little later.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.600
For example, again, the positioning

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.820
matrix in two axes.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.960
This is the demand for the product

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.980
price and perceived value by the consumer.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.300
The most optimal is the location

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.100
of the goods on the diagonal, when

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.780
the requested price corresponds

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.140
to the perceived value

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.000
of the product or service

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.500
you offer to the consumer.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.120
If we are, please note, on

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.020
the site above the diagonal, then

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.540
this zone is called missed opportunities.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.520
That is, you are asking for a too

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.040
high price and your sales will

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.080
not be as big as they might be.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.340
On the other hand, if we offer

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.960
a higher perceived value at a

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.820
lower price, this is a company’

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.420
s underreceived profit, and, accordingly,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.320
the company has no opportunity

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.460
to develop its offerings

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.460
further, that is, to develop.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.260
For example, to illustrate, let’

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.660
s consider washing powders as

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.220
the most familiar product for

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.980
everyone.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.180
High price, high perceived

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.940
value - this is the Ariel

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.420
Persil class washing powder.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.920
At the same time, the bottom diagonally

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.180
will be, these powders, for example,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.460
under the Dosia brand,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.740
that is, the price companies

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.020
produce on powders depending

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.960
on how we perceive, and the

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.840
intermediate products should

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.860
ideally be located precisely

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.380
diagonally between Dosia

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.880
and Real powder.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.460
If we want to build a pricing policy,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.980
we need to go through a number

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.260
of stages.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.760
Pay attention to the slide.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.020
The first step is to set

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.380
the task of pricing.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.260
The second step is the definition of demand.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.860
The third stage is the estimation of costs

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.020
associated with the production of

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.840
products or the provision of services.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.440
The fourth phase is the analysis of costs,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.260
prices and offers of competitors.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.120
The fifth step is the choice of pricing method.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.460
The sixth, final, stage is the

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.920
final price determination.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.140
Let us look at each of the stages

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.260
in more detail.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.400
In the first phase, we

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.640
must formulate the tasks

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.820
that are facing companies, that

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.920
is, within which we

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.600
will build our pricing.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.440
The tasks can be completely different.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.220
For example, survival, and in

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.460
this case we will build a

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.880
pricing policy in such a way

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.960
that the company’s minimum

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.200
level of viability in the market

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.060
is to stretch it out.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.440
This can be the maximization of

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.540
current profit, or the sale, otherwise

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.780
it is often called the sale of a

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.280
company’s share in the market, and

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.480
in this case we have an absolutely

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.000
different pricing strategy.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.220
That is, before you start

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.880
pricing, you need to clearly

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.220
understand what the company

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.620
currently faces.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.680
The second phase.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.280
We need to determine how sensitive

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.060
our consumers are to price.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.440
In this case, we should

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.880
consider at least 9 factors.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.140
Factor one.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.600
Does the product have distinctive,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.880
bright distinctive characteristics?

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.160
The more unique your product or

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.080
service is, the less you have

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.160
to focus on your competitors,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.780
respectively, the less sensitive

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.120
your consumers will be to

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.440
the price set.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.460
Phase two.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.700
How much consumers are informed

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.860
about the availability of

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.740
replacement products or

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.540
similar products?

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.280
Here a bright example is the increase

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.420
of our price with a deeper familiarity

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.140
with the market of household

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.220
appliances.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.420
At present, we choose the long-

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.000
term demand product that we

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.680
need, and already then

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.460
buy it at the point of sale

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.160
where it is cheapest.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.440
Although we initially had certain

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.980
fears and risks associated with

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.260
the fact that we would buy a low

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.880
quality product, we would buy a product

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.680
with the wrong characteristics.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.220
But the opportunity to turn to

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.360
our own experience, to the expertise

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.920
of friends, acquaintances, consumers,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.380
who left their opinion on the Internet,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.720
more and more make us sensitive

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.460
to the price.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.320
The third factor is whether you

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.500
have the ability to compare

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.080
or compare your offers with the

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.280
offers of competitors.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.180
For example, if you chose a tariff from a

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.640
cellular operator, then you probably noticed

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.300
that it is extremely difficult to compare

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.440
not only the tariffs of two different

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.560
operators, but also the tariffs

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.160
even within the same operator.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.020
At some point we abandoned

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.700
the idea of rational decision making

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.500
and went into the realm

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.200
of emotions.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.880
We were less clean at

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.900
the price.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.180
The same situation is observed when

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.140
purchasing, for example,

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.140
cars, laptops and other goods.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.120
How much the costs of purchasing this

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.560
type of goods occupy a significant

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.240
part of the consumer budget.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.220
If it is a small cost, we pay

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.440
less attention to the price.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.520
Do you know how much the light bulbs cost?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.740
I am not.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.860
Accordingly, most likely, at whatever

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.900
price they are offered to us,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.360
within the framework of reasonable, we

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.720
will consider it reasonable.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.640
The effect of final benefit.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.300
an interesting factor.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.980
What value does your product

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.240
or offer actually create for

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.660
the consumer?

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.900
For example, in the consulting services

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.040
market, pricing often stops

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.900
not from labor costs, but from the

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.180
benefit that the customer will receive.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.440
If the customer’s income is tens of

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.320
millions of dollars, then it is unlikely

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.520
that the consultant will provide

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.820
a service for a thousand or two dollars.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.260
Most likely, the price will

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.760
be much higher, and the customer

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.260
will buy because he gets

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.620
a much greater profit than

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.540
his costs associated

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.280
with the service.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.180
6 is

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.400
Does anyone else bear

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.800
the cost of the purchase?

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.540
For example, was a grant granted,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.820
was the state aid to a particular

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.080
enterprise for the purchase

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.540
of production equipment?

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.780
If such assistance is provided,

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.880
then we usually become less sensitive

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.360
to price.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.220
7 is

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.940
Whether there is a possibility

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.680
of using the product Accessories we

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.900
often do not think about their price.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.240
However, accessories to a cell phone

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.160
are not cheap.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.960
But nevertheless, having

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.780
already a prestigious phone,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.140
a mobile phone, we will only

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.700
purchase certain goods or

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.200
services that can work with

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.880
that phone.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.040
Accordingly, on accessories the

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.620
price can be set higher,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.320
because the consumer is less

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.140
valuable.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.620
Price as an indicator of higher quality

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.560
of the product.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.060
Here everything is simple.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.460
Note, if I offer you to buy a Patek

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.780
Philippe watch for $700-800

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.420
at their normal average price

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.360
of $20-25 thousand, you are

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.240
unlikely to perceive this

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.400
offer as a real watch, even

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.720
if they are at least 10

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.800
times real.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.680
The price of quality is a very important

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.360
factor, and we focus primarily on

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.700
the price, giving a conclusion about

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.760
the quality of the product.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.200
I have a very interesting example

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.500
here, related to manipulation.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.500
Manipulation by the consumer.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.880
One of the manufacturers we

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.880
recommended to package their

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.660
basic product in a cheaper packaging.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.200
This was necessary to create a flank

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.980
brand while defending in a

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.840
price war.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.360
But in order not to create

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.660
a new product, we found it profitable

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.560
to offer the same content

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.840
in a more expensive version

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.520
and in a cheaper one.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.060
The only thing that has changed is the

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.160
packaging, and of course the price.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.000
And now I often stand before a choice,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.800
in front of the shop deck and knowing

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.760
that both boxes are the same,

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.760
I find it hard to persuade

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.200
myself to take a cheaper

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.300
offer, because I perceive

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.620
quality as lower and I know

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.760
that the content is the

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.940
same.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.080
The factor ninth.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.920
Consumers do not have the possibility

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.460
to store the goods.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.640
All very simple.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.080
If you can’t store a product,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.600
it breaks down quickly, then you

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.580
can’t make a stock of that

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.800
product and stop buying it

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.620
for a while.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.240
For example, the increase in electricity prices.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.160
Who can provide electricity?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:38.720
None of.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.740
But it is vital to all, and we will

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.340
pay the price that we will be

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.320
called.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.400
The entry of Poland into the

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.420
European Union was a paradoxical

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.880
situation.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.040
At the time of the entry, prices

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.540
for a number of basic products,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.480
such as sugar, flour, were to rise.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.120
The population began to store these

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.820
products in advance.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.920
That is, they stormed hypermarkets,

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.460
made huge stocks.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.360
After the entry, the sales of sugar

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.480
and flour dropped sharply, they

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.920
actually fell to zero.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.300
And producers-suppliers were forced

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.340
to lower prices in order to at

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.900
least somehow stimulate demand.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.380
That is, by creating a stock, the population

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.560
protected itself from a sharp price

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.380
increase, became more sensitive

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.480
to the price offer for these

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.460
food products.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.560
The second step is the definition of demand.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.020
In particular, we need to

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.100
determine how elastic our demand

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:40.940
is.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.120
The concept of “price elasticity” you will

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.320
consider in more detail in the course of economics.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.060
But still a few words.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.200
Elastic demand is when a change

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.320
in price occurs a significant

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.320
fluctuation in consumption of a

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.680
given good or service.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.380
That is, if prices rise, then consumption

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.520
decreases, and vice versa, if prices

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.420
fall, then consumption of goods

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.060
or services increases.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.740
The elasticity of demand is calculated by

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.640
the formula.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.440
This is the change in the amount

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.880
of consumption of a product in percentage

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.100
divided by the change in the price

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.460
of a product.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.600
If the elasticized demand

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.740
factor is greater than one unit,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.340
the demand is considered to

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.280
be elastic.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.380
If the elasticity factor is

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.800
less than one unit, demand

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.160
is considered to be non-elastic.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.560
Separate cross elasticity.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.940
This is when a change in prices affects

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.160
a change in consumption of another brand

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.180
or product.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.060
How to determine price elasticity?

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.580
There are several approaches.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.980
First of all, this is an expert

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.780
assessment, which is based on

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.860
the factors we listed with you

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.180
in the previous step.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.180
The second stage, or the second method,

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.600
is the survey of buyers.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.640
That is, we and you will consider

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.240
one of the targets later, which allows you

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.780
to determine the dependence of the volume

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.640
of sales of a particular product

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.620
on the price.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.640
The third is price experiments, namely

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.640
temporary discounts on individual

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.280
goods, different prices on the same

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.420
territory, for example, in different

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.940
shopping points, it is the use

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.500
of the Internet and the assessment

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.700
of the level of demand for

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.100
your goods in different online stores.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.040
The last step is to analyze

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.400
the actual data.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.020
That is, we look at how historically

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.900
the demand for your product has changed

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.400
depending on the price changes.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.360
The main factors, a little repeat,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.320
which affect the number

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.140
to the price.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.840
This is the effect of the reference price,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.940
that is, how much consumers are

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.080
aware of the prices for a given

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.460
product or service.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.120
Another example is the price

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.620
alignment of high-tech

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.100
goods in the United

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.600
States and Russia.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.600
For example, at one time these prices

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.900
differed twice or more times on complex

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:23.000
household appliances, but with the advent

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.380
of the Internet to clarify the price

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.340
in America for this product for me

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.180
is much easier than going to the store

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.120
across the road.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.220
I can do this without leaving

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.680
my workplace or leaving

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.620
my home.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.500
Accordingly, seeing a significant

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.580
price difference, I will consider

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.380
the offer unfair and for various

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.380
reasons.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.860
The main thing is the unfairness

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.800
of the price.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.620
I will refuse to purchase this product

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.180
in Russia.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.100
But such a moment can only

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.700
be transferred to goods or

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.700
services that I can transfer

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.440
privately from one continent

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.420
to another.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.500
The effect of complexity of comparison, which

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.960
we have already talked about with you.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.980
The cost of switching.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.440
The most important aspect

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.240
is the B2B area.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.820
If you have a factory or

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.260
factory, some equipment is

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.080
installed, then switching to

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.220
other consumables is often impossible.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.020
They just don’t fit, don’

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.100
t stick with your equipment.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.520
And accordingly, what offer

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.240
unprofitable you did not, but

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.700
to replace equipment is much more

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.640
expensive and more difficult than

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.700
to continue to pay the established,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.560
let the unfair price.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.040
The price-quality effect is how

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.360
we perceive value in relation

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.340
to some objective characteristics.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.700
This effect does not work in

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.060
the consumer market, but has proven

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.320
itself well in the industrial

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.380
markets.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.320
For example, you offer pipes that

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.320
are twice as expensive as those that

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.440
are currently purchasing LCCs, but

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.320
at the same time the data pipes’

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.480
lifetime is 4 times higher.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.560
We can very clearly compare the price,

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.040
quality and, accordingly, the benefits

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.640
of the end consumer.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.720
The cost effect, the share in the structure

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.220
and the cost of your consumer.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.780
The effect of the ultimate benefit, we and

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.000
you also talked about it and

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.620
translated an example from

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.020
constitutional practice.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.620
The effect of fair price, in this case,

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:41.140
is already the effect of consumers perception

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.600
of the reasonability of your price.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.300
The framework effect, in particular,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.740
is what losses or benefits the consumer

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.140
can acquire in the event of a

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.180
mistake, a wrong choice.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.360
That is, when buying a chewing

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.080
gum, you do not think about the

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.500
fact that your costs can be extremely

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.180
large.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.960
I didn’t like it, you threw it out.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.200
Consequently, you are less

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.680
thinking about both the price

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.940
and the choice you make.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.020
These can be combinations of gains

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.980
or losses, including.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.580
The effect of stock.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.080
Phase 3 involves estimating the costs

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.140
associated with the production

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.460
of products or the cost

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.140
of services.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.420
In particular, we need to

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.340
distinguish between fixed,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.460
variable and total costs

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.260
associated with the product

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.640
or service.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.780
You will be able to learn more about

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.660
these concepts in terms of finance.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.880
We need to assess how our costs

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.420
will change depending

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.800
on the impact of the experience.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.880


00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.340
The effect of experience is a decrease

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.080
in the price by a given percentage

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.580
when the volume of production doubles.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.480
Pay attention to the slide.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.540
It demonstrates a decrease in

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.900
cost taking into account the effect

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.640
of experience, i.e. historically

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.940
produced products.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.400
For example, some Western companies

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.800
begin to sell products

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.440
at prices that are much higher

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.720
than the cost of production

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.820
at the first stage.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.200
But then, having accumulated the effect

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.520
of experience, they get a significant

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.360
reduction in the cost of products and

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.620
start to earn on the product

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.700
or service.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.040
The fourth stage is the analysis

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.560
of prices and offers of competitors.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.240
What are the market offers

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.980
your competitors are making

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.500
or can make?

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.160
If the company’s sales offer is little

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.860
different from the main competitor’s

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.120
offer, that is, there is no uniqueness

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.420
of your products or services we talked

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.660
about, then the price of the product

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.800
should be roughly the same as

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.840
the price of your competitors’ products.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.160
If the company’s offer is inferior

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.020
in quality, it simply has no

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.460
possibility to set a higher

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.480
price than its competitors.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.480
Or this action will be only temporary

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.300
with a subsequent sharp

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.740
drop in demand for a product

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.340
or service.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.360
If the product offered is

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.040
superior to the competitor’s product,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.180
then you can set a higher

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.320
price for your product accordingly.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.100


00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.020
But it is important to remember

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.780
that the superiority of your product

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.660
should be known to the consumer,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.400
not just you or your competitors.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.600
The fifth stage.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.480
Choose a pricing method that

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.400
will be used for a sufficiently

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.760
extended period of time.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.600
Here we need to take into account a number

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.180
of points, for example, that

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.720
low sales price is the absence

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.340
of profit of the enterprise.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.120
When we set higher prices,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.980
we may not get enough demand

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.420
for our products.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.080
The first method of pricing is the cost

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.820
method plus the surcharge.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.680
Pay attention to the slide,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.940
we have some data.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.260
Variable costs per unit of product

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.740
are $ 10, fixed costs are related

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.460
to the issue of dollars,

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.180
the estimated volume of sales

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.600
in pieces - 50 thousand.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.340
We must calculate the cost of

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.140
production of a unit of product already

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.380
taking into account the constant

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.140
costs, that is, to $10 add

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.600
the transferred constant costs

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600
per unit of product.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.820
In this case, the cost

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.560
will be $16.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:31.260
The target bonus is 20%, we

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.080
need to divide this value

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:39.060
by 1 minus 0.2 and the target

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.320
price based on this method

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.720
will be $ 20.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.100
The method is very simple, understandable,

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.060
but nevertheless, it does not take into

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.820
account a number of market factors, including

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.600
competitor prices, it does not take into

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.180
account the possibility of losing profit

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.780
if you set a price too low, or, on

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.660
the contrary, do not get the

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.140
required volume of sales at a higher

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.080
price.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.300
The next method is the method of

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.060
pricing based on the target rate of profit.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.580
In this case, it is an economic

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:19.440
calculation, where we operate

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.880
such parameters as cost, which

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.920
includes constant variable

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.560
costs, and sales volume.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.420
And we try to determine, pay attention

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.940
to the schedule, the required

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.120
amount of profit, that is, we

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.260
set the price, focusing on the

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.580
amount of profit we need.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.020
The price of the product affects

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.180
the orientation of the product, this

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.460
must be taken into account in

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.900
this method of pricing.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.140
That is, pay attention to the

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.660
slide, it is a closed system.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.160
Once you increase some

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.700
costs, such as the volume

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.860
of advertising, or more

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.020
strive to encourage sellers.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.840
This increases the cost of products,

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.800
thereby reducing the overall

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.700
margin.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.960
Therefore, when setting prices based

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.580
on this method, you need to take

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.500
into account all the actions of the company.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.360
As a rule, this method is not

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.500
mostly market-based, and

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.540
as the first method we consider

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.300
is only used to confirm the

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.880
validity of prices, which we

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.420
will determine by other methods.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.720
The third method is to set the price

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.280
based on the perceived value of the goods.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.740
In this case, we conduct

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.740
certain marketing research

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.340
to obtain feedback from

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.800
consumers about what

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.460
price they consider

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.480
fair for the product

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.620
or service.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.120
A little more detailed about one of

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.700
the methods of conducting these

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.300
researches we will talk below.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.960
The price of education is based on

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.560
the real value of the goods.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.980
In this case, a method is used,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.240
for example, the price of quality.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.940
When we set a price, based on the

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.880
ratio of the price of quality

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.700
for our product, or on the basis

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.080
of the benefit that the consumer will receive.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.680
Here, remember the examples we considered

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.220
a little above, in particular

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.420
about pipes and consulting.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.060
Pricing according to current

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.260
price levels.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.400
In this case, a number of

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.880
approaches can be considered.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.360
For example, following a market

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.020
leader, when we set our price a certain

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.680
percentage above or below the

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.060
market leader price.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.680
But in this case, it is important

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.900
to consider that you are completely

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.120
dependent on this leader and will

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.260
more involuntarily repeat his actions.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.880
It is important to understand that the market

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.560
leader also works people, and people

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.980
are typical to be mistaken, and there

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.240
are many such examples.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.040
In particular, an approach can be considered

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.800
when you set a price, focusing

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.240
not on one competitor, but

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.640
on a number of competitors.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.360
That is, you put a certain methodology when

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.320
the price is taken for a certain type of product

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.940
of one competitor - the second, third and fourth,

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.640
and you set your price from the average

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.780
price you get, i.e. the price of the product

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.040
is calculated by the price of the

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.220
competitor.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.820
The price of the competitors’

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.900
products divided by the

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.120
number of competitors you have considered.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.920
In this case, you are less attached to

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.380
the mistakes of one of your competitors

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.580
in the market and have the ability

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.260
to keep the average

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.520
market price.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.720
This does not mean that you

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.740
have to set the same price as you

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.800
did when calculating.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.120
No is.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.360
You can be, for example, 5% below

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.540
the average market value received,

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:46.340
or 10% above that price.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.300
Pricing at auctions.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.800
We do not mean here only auctions

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.100
or tenders for the purchase

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.740
of products.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.880
We can also use a calculation method

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.800
based on the theory of probability.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.820
Pay attention to the slide.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.840
We have a table where one of the

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.320
columns is a competitive price,

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.260
that is, the price we want

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.520
to set for this product.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.680
This is an estimate of efficiency, that is,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.920
the profitability of the product, is the

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.060
probability of receiving an order at a

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.660
given price in percentage, and the expected

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.700
roy is already roy of the profitability

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.300
of our products, multiplied

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.140
by the probability.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.780
Accordingly, probability is

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.940
assessed by expert, or on the basis

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.000
of market analysis, and we are

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.500
already focused on maximizing the

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.240
expected ROI, that is, ROI-

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.860
production multiplied by probability.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.660
In this case, the most

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.960
optimal choice for us is

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.680
the cost of $ 3 per unit

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.620
of products.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.900
These methods are more detailed

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.100
in the work of the last two Nobel

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.020
laureates in the field of economics.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.440
The sixth stage is the

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.400
direct final determination of

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.980
the price of the product.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.300
We also need to take into account

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.980
the psychology of our customers.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.580
Here we collect all the material we

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.100
have accumulated in the previous stages.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.080
This is also positioning, it is also the perception

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.060
of the quality of the product.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.820
This is what number should

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.920
end our price.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.000
For example, flat numbers are always

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.540
confusing, consumers will be artificial.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.480
But if you buy a car and you

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.620
are set a price of exactly $

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.820
30,000, it will probably raise

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.660
questions.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.420
But at the same time, even the cost

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.300
of the car at 31,278, or better yet

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.660
with cents, will seem fair,

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.100
it is obtained as a result

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.680
of reasonable calculations.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.520
We need to consider things like the

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.480
quality of the brand, what we talked

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.940
about, the level of competition

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.580
and the type of competition

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.060
that exists in the market.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.940
We must take into account the knowledge

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.640
of our product by consumers, knowledge

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.120
of the consumer characteristics

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.640
of our offer.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.100
Based on these elements of the

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.320
marketing mix, the final price of

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.680
the product is established.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.880
In particular, on the slide you

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.340
can pay attention to how much

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.440
changes in the field of brand awareness,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.940
the amount of advertising budget

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.500
and perceived quality

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.340
of products affect the value

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.180
of your product.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.580
For example, with low quality of

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.700
the product, but in large advertising,

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.680
low advertising costs, the price

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.360
will be, take it for the base, $ 100.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.380
At the same time, another extreme

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.460
is high perceptible quality, and

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.760
large advertising budgets

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.120
allow you to set a maximum

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.500
price of $300 for a similar

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.740
product.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.800
At the same time, average quality, high

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.860
advertising costs on the promotion

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.440
of the product allow to double

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.860
the price from the original.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.080
Accordingly, pay attention to

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.480
what parameters or goals were

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.800
set in other elements

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.820
of the marketing mix.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.260
An important parameter

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.240
in the value formation is also the way

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.580
of delivering the goods to

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.680
the final consumer.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.380
You should consider the supply

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.720
chain, the established margin or

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.680
the optimal profit for the participants

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.240
in the chain.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.140
You should pay attention

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.780
to legislation and government

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.920
pricing, you should focus on

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.380
suppliers or potential

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.940
price changes from suppliers,

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.000
competitors, and sales staff

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.640
that are stimulated

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.200
or motivated by the

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.740
value of your products.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.080
Accordingly, pricing seems

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.620
to absorb everything you’ve

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.220
provided before, designing

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.100
your company’s marketing mix.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.000
We promised to look more in

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.320
detail at one of the ways of researching

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.100
the market to determine the optimal

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.180
price.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.980
The method is called Price Sensitivity

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:28.260
Measurament and is based on a number

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.440
of questions we ask the consumer.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.220
That is, the consumer is described characteristics

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.060
or the product is demonstrated,

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.200
well in our case, the washing machine

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.440
of the washing brand, the

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.800
drying mode, the delicate washing

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:45.460
mode, the warranty and other characteristics

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.560
are used as an example,

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.660
and we ask the consumer a number

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.620
of questions.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.680
What do you think the price

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.400
of this washing machine is

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.920
so high that you don’t start

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.960
buying it?

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.820
What price does this washing machine

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.380
seem so low that you ask questions

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.140
about its quality?

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.400
What is the minimum price of this

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.880
washing machine seems to you high,

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.580
but for which it is still possible

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.820
to buy.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.900
What price would you buy this washing

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.820
machine, considering that you made

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.800
a very profitable purchase?

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.900
It is important to note that

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.160
this survey can only be

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.600
conducted among respondents who

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.240
are currently facing a choice

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.000
and are oriented in the

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.580
product you are conducting

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.620
the survey.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.720
In particular, as a result we can

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:47.320
set up a schedule where we get,

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.700
pay attention to the slide, 4

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.660
lines based on the questions

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.980
received and 2 lines, this is

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.120
the sum of the replies.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.680
On this chart it is customary to highlight

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.540
4 points,

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.380
in that price that the largest

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.500
number of consumers consider acceptable.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.380
It is the point of the optimal price,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.340
at which the least number of people

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.660
reject the product because of

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.300
its too high price.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.340
The point of the limit of cheapness,

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.160
that is, below which questions

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.640
about the quality of your offer will arise.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.520
And the point of the limit cost,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.960
that is, at a higher price,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.560
the proportion of buyers who

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.560
refuse to buy this product significantly

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.220
increases.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.940
Based on the results obtained,

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.060
based on the company’s strategy, its

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.200
position on the market and other parameters,

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.500
in which we talked above, you

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.520
can choose the most optimal option

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.220
for the position of the

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.640
product on the market.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.900
For example, there are goods for

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.200
special occasions, such as

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:10.220
tarts, champagne, engagement rings,

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.160
then the price for these goods or

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.080
services can be quite high.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.780
If we need a product, such as a

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.980
beacon, which we will talk about a

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.560
little later, which corresponds to

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.880
the price level for our products,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.360
then it can be the price of a losing

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.100
leader, and so on, and so on,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:27.660
and so on.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.600
It is important to keep in mind

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.800
that for a number of regions or a number

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800
of our customers we

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.740
may use discriminatory pricing.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.380
Discriminatory pricing is

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.220
the stimulation of the behavior

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.600
we need from consumers.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.380
Pay attention to the slide.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.900
In this case, the cost of the

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.180
equivalent of water under the brand

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.620
Avian - equivalent to 1.5 liters.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.380
If we buy it for one

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.000
bottle, we will have

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.500
about $2.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.000
If we are going to buy it in

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.220
small bottles of 50 grams, then the

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.480
price for this water will

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.820
already be $ 6.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.440
The manufacturer encourages consumers

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.720
to purchase the goods in the most

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.000
advantageous packaging for them.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.120
Accordingly, discriminatory pricing

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.060
can be used to account

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.380
for the location of the

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.860
goods, so alcoholic beverages

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.340
in the store are much cheaper

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.640
than in the restaurant.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.540
With time in mind, some goods

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.500
or services at night are much

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.620
more expensive.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.980
Taking into account the image

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.760
of the goods, in order to support,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.560
position on many goods, a higher

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.380
price is established, that is,

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.400
to emphasize the status of this good.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.000
In pricing we must also consider

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.980
where our product, for which we

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.360
are currently setting the price,

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.820
is within the product line,

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.820
what role it plays.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.800
We must consider which additional

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.500
devices or services the

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.820
consumer may need in

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.340
connection with the purchase.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.140
We must consider prices and

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.120
also immediately install

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.440
on accessories, in particular,

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.920
a bright example of

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.060
cars, there we will need quite

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.320
a lot of different

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.140
accessories to make life

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.200
and use comfortable.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.020
The price is assigned from

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.720
two components, such as

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.640
the initial fee and subsequent payments.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.340
To minimize waste,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.080
we can sell them

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:39.440
in a series as some

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.100
raw material for

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.560
subsequent use

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.700
by consumers.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.940
And setting a package price is the

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.740
price for a set.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.540
That is, for example, you buy not

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.580
one shampoo, but immediately a shampoo,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.820
a shower gel and a washer.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.640
The variation in prices is reflected

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.240
in the overall results of the enterprise.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.900
Pay attention to the slides, here are

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.980
the possible actions of the company

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.020
and their consequences.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.920
The preservation of price and perceived

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.000
quality of the goods and the selective

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.600
reduction in the number of customers

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.500
will lead to a reduction in market

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.280
share and a decrease in the profit

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.120
of the company as a whole.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.280
Increasing the price and quality of the

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.160
goods will lead to a decrease in market share,

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.240
let’s remember about the elastic demand,

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.600
and the maintenance of the level

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.180
of profitability of the

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.980
company in the long term.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.900
Preserving the price and improving

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.840
the quality of the goods will lead

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.000
to a reduction in market share

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.800
and a short-term decrease in profitability.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.360
But at the same time, in the long

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.080
term, profitability with a partial

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.720
price drop and improved product

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.760
quality will lead to the preservation

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.700
of market share, while at the same

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.740
time you will face short-

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.840
term decline in profitability

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.300
and long-term growth.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.300
The reduction in the price of goods

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.820
with the constant quality will lead to

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.680
the preservation of market share

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.980
and the short-term decrease in

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.760
the profitability of the company,

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.540
in relation to competitors, of course.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.140
A reduction in the price of all goods

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.620
at a lower quality will lead to a preservation

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.820
of market share, encounter profits and

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.200
a decrease in the long-term profitability

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.220
of the company.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.220
Preserving the price and reducing

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.080
the perceived quality of products will

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.420
lead to a reduction in market share,

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.400
preserving profits and reducing

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.860
profits in the long term.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.480
The continuation of a new economic

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.040
model, that is, to offer something

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.300
new, innovation.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.540
On the one hand, the introduction

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.240
of new products into the range

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.000
is a risk of cannibalism, when

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.240
this sales at the expense of

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.640
other products of your range

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.820
line, but potentially can lead

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.300
to an increase in sales.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.620
Here you must soberly assess

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.720
all risks and positioning your

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.560
products within the range.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.100
Now the question is, how

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.120
to set prices for new products?

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.160
If the product is really new,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.140
then a cream removal strategy

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.220
is usually used.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.960
That is, at first, the higher

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.280
price, yes, is only available

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.900
to the top of the consumer pyramid,

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.060
that is, the most wealthy

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.860
people, but then it decreases

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.860
over time so that we can capture

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.240
more and more consumers

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.760
and make the goods available

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.940
to them.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.380
In this case, we get the opportunity

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.180
to maintain profitability

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.460
for a higher time, gradual

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.440
capacity building and less

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.400
risk associated with the withdrawal

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.960
of this product.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.720
The negative points can be attributed

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:07.860
to a small product, but on the

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.660
other hand, and a higher income

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.860
from each sale.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.580
If we talk about the penetration

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.160
strategy, then as a rule it is already

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.040
used when withdrawing goods,

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.320
analogues of which exist

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.620
on the market.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.900
The penetration price strategy

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.700
is when the lowest price

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.620
is set, and the company

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.060
quickly buys a market

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.520
share.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.400
At the same time, the disadvantages

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.660
can be attributed to significant difficulties,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.820
and often the inability to raise

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.040
prices for your goods or services,

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.480
because consumers do not consider

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.060
them fair and refuse to buy them.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.500
Such cases have repeatedly

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.040
occurred on the market when federal

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.780
companies entered the regions, when

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.800
the price of penetration was originally made.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.640
After some time, when the price increased,

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.720
the sales volume actually fell to

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.780
zero.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.380
Neutral strategy is to minimize

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.420
the role of price at the same

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.360
time, and if consumers are

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.620
price sensitive, then this strategy

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.600
will not allow you to effectively

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.700
enter the market and can only

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.020
be applied with a significant

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.600
uniqueness of your product.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.020
There is also the possibility

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.460
of price changes.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.200
In particular, the initiative

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.160
change of prices that occurs

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.240
due to your decisions, your actions.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.780
You can do them when you exist

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.240
before production loads,

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.500
or when your market share

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.900
drops to increase it, or during

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.720
periods of economic downturn,

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.880
to again loads production.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.220
Increase of prices.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.840
As a rule, this is the process of inflation,

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.080
the price adjustment by the percentage

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.480
of inflation, or the cut off of

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.160
excess demand, that is, when there

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.420
is a deficit in the market, you should

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.020
not miss the opportunity

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.980
to get additional profit or

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.500
increase in costs.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.720
The most bright example is the

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.080
increase in energy costs, which

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.820
occupies a significant share

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.580
of the cost of almost any product.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.600
You should be prepared for such

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.140
actions and provide for their

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.180
pricing policy of your company.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.960
A reactive change in prices is a change

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.560
in response to the actions of a competitor.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.400
As a rule, this is a kind of price

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.380
attack, and here you need to answer a number

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.440
of questions why they changed

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.360
the price.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.900
This is a temporary or permanent

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.000
price reduction.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.600
They get rid of the warehouse

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.080
residues, or they have unloaded

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.660
areas, or what will other

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.180
competitors do about these

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.700
actions.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.900
Thus, the pricing strategy

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.200
depends on the product

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.080
or market life cycle.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.080
So, in the initial stages, the price

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.020
is set based on the cream removal

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:03.000
strategy, and usually does not

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.980
change dramatically until the market

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.420
grows rapidly enough, stormily.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.280
At the same time, in mature markets,

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.980
when consumers are better aware

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.940
of the characteristics of your

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.500
offer, the offer of competitors,

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.120
a strategy is used similar

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.780
to the price of the competitor.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.320
And with the market's extinction, a

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.740
sharp drop in demand, a strategy of penetration.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.740
The lower the price, the longer

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.680
you can stay on the market.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.360
It is also important to remember

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.880
the need to adjust prices.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.000
Adjustment of prices by geographical

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.740
characteristics.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.900
If the logistics in the Far East occupies

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.740
a significant share of the value

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.460
of your products, then, accordingly,

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.380
the prices will be higher, you should

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.040
provide for the setting of discounts

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.860
and various interconnections when

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:01.020
adjusting prices, you should

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.580
provide for pricing based

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.800
on some stocks, promotional actions

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.360
for the sale of seasonal discounts,

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.480
discriminatory pricing,

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.900
in order to educate within the

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.820
marketing mix, that is,

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.620
what we have talked about

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.060
with you a little above.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.320
Adaptation of prices is a change

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.080
in price taking into account differences

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.780
in demand and perceived value of goods.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.660
Adaptation allows to increase

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.400
profit or increase market

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.160
share.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.460
In particular, when adapting you

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.000
should consider parameters such as

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.840
the ability to identify buyers,

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.840
differentiate your product line,

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.000
so that consumers perceive differently

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.540
those products that are

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.120
contained in your product portfolio,

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.940
and these products do not compete

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.640
with each other for the

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.960
consumer wallet.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.960
You must consider the situation

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.540
of buying or using the goods.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.780
In particular, a classic example

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.000
is the price setting for pregnancy

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.960
tests.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.920
When one of the companies studied consumer

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.000
behavior and found an interesting fact

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.280
that those for whom this pregnancy is desirable,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.220
in the pharmacy are looking for a test in

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.200
the command area and for them the price

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.160
factor is not important, a brightly

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.940
visible packaging is important.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.380
At the same time, those for whom

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.720
this pregnancy is so unexpected,

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.820
look for a pregnancy test

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:45.840
in the area where contraceptives are placed.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.100
Accordingly, the company packaged the

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.680
same test, in two different

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.160
packages assigned different

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.260
prices.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.980
That is, in the command area there were

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.940
tests in bright noticeable packaging at

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.640
a high price and dark undetectable

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.420
packaging at a low price in the area

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:13.480
where the display was made and also

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.220
taking into account the features

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.000
of the deal you are making with partners.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.900
For example, in the industrial segment,

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.500
when you make your first deal, you

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.660
may go for certain concessions

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.440
to give you a chance to prove

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.300
that you are a truly reliable

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.820
standing supplier.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.260
Discount and account.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.040
You can provide discounts for the amount

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.280
of sales per month for the amount of

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.380
a single purchase, discounts can

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.240
be seasonal, in particular,

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.180
in the fashion industry it has

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.780
already become a tradition,

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.020
discounts are timed to some special

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.480
events, the company's

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.100
birthday, or a national holiday.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.080
Promotional fees when you provide

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.360
and set prices for commodity

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.340
exchange barter transactions.

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.800
Discrimination may go, as we have

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.920
already said, but again

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.500
we will repeat by consumer

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.720
segments to different versions

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.480
of the product, in particular newer

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.220
versions of cars sold at a higher

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.120
price, place of sale, territorial

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.720
differences, i.e. geographical

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.980
and time of sale.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.680
You must consider, to

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.340
set prices the psychology of the

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.620
consumer, that is, how comfortable

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.940
for the consumer is the price.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.380
Well, a bright example is the

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.260
usual prices, ending at 99, and

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.520
these are prices set on the Ford

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.680
Focus, below many Korean and Chinese

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.500
cars, but this is the base

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.180
price.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.640
When you start buying additional

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.240
equipment, everything will return

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.680
to its own circles.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.620
And the geographical principle.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.320
If you need to lower consumer

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.580
sensitivity to price, then

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.160
you have a number of ways.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.700
In particular, you’ve all seen the “

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.440
200 dollar car” advertisement.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.020
In this case, the cost of

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:25.420
the car is not indicated, but the

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.700
monthly payment.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.300
Or the price of the first fee may be

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.640
indicated, which significantly reduces

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.700
the sensitivity of consumption

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.140
to the price.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.660
You can change the amount of

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:39.460
goods or services you provide

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.160
to a customer.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.680
This is how products in cardboard

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.880
packaging, which weigh 685 grams,

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.140
537 grams and so on appear.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.380
That is, leaving a certain volume,

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.060
the quantity of goods in this package

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.700
decreases.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.000


00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.440
Change in the quality

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.520
of the goods or services provided.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.040
When the market enters its

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.360
final stages, certain price

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.600
manoeuvres between competitors begin.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.140
In this case, in order to ensure

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.980
the price of penetrations, it is necessary

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.360
to reduce the quality of the

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.240
goods, that is, actually reduce

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.060
their costs.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.800
Changes in discounts and pricing are

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.900
also perceived differently by the consumer.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.620
In particular, some jewelry

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.140
stores offer discounts ranging

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.520
from 40% to 60%, and

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.740
consumers can’t compare

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.520
prices and go to the

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.880
significant amount of discount

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.820
they may be given.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.260
But they actually pay

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.800
a full price for this product.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.760
Changes in time and place of transfer

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.000
of property rights are

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.980
also interesting.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.060
Well, in particular, working with one of

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.020
the telecom companies faced the fact that

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.800
they had extremely high prices for

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.080
dedicated channels of Internet

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.900
access via DSL technology.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.120
When I asked, did you

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:08.820
sell anything?

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.080
I say yes, and a lot.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:10.700
How is?

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.540
We provide free equipment

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.760
and a channel for testing

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.980
to the consumer.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.700
What is the percentage of

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.940
equipment returns?

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.520
They looked at me surprised, he was not there.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.820
Consumers a month, free of charge

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.600
to try this technology, refuse

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.500
to return, they have already used

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.140
to it, they consider this equipment

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.140
their own.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.840
The change in place and time of payment

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.460
– a vivid example – is the increase

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.960
in demand for cars after car

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.900
loans became available.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.020
Change of payment method – all of

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.220
you have noticed that money

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.960
from a debit or credit card goes

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.880
out much faster than from your

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.540
pocket.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.800
We don’t know them, we control them less.

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.720
Accordingly, the emergence

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.980
of payment terminals can potentially

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.460
increase the volume of one-off

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.500
purchases in your store.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.260
There are other ways

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.340
to manipulate the consumer.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.820
In particular, there is a

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.480
class of goods that I Cocktail,

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.760
Cocktail, sell below

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.300
the purchase cost to demonstrate

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.140
that all other prices in

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.900
the store are also low.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.060
Such price moves can also be

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.900
encountered in our retail

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.800
trade, when the price of

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.460
a certain type of goods is extremely

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:43.760
low in advertising, when the

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.860
price of this reference group

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.580
is set to be extremely low.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:53.140
We remember prices for seven or

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.400
eight types of goods.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.840
For men, it’s usually cigarettes,

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.320
beer, continue the list further.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.480
Women are what is mostly

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.820
related to food.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.280
It is in focusing on these prices that

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.400
we estimate the level of cost of the

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.520
entire trading point.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.700
To check, go to the bar.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.620
A large area where a lot

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.320
of goods are laid out.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.340
Look where your eyes

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.620
are first.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.440
That is, on which goods you assess

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.280
the price level in the overall

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.300
trading point.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.720
Thus, by reducing to certain

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.540
groups of goods, prices that consumers

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.460
remember, and valuing to a price

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.100
point, you can create a general

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.960
image of your business

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.300
as a territory of either low

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.560
prices or very expensive.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.600
In the industrial segment, as a

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.920
rule, buyers also do not remember the prices

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.180
for the entire range.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.700
They focus on certain beacon

00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:58.960
products.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.600
Well, in the furniture industry, this

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.960
table is a meter twenty-

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.880
seven, a sliding tub and a shelf.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.300
The total cost of this set is

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:11.800
estimated by the level of cost

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.500
of the natural collection.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.440
Goods are scary, usually they are

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.620
not sold, they give us a comparison point.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:26.400
Well, a simple example, when

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.040
you come to a mall to make

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.120
a purchase, the first offer

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.380
we usually never buy.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:31.820
Why is?

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.900
We need to compare how expensive

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.660
it is, so cheap it is.

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.640
And in these cases, it is sometimes

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.160
useful for the consumer to ask this

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.480
point of comparison, that is, to expose

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.680
some desirable that this product is

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.600
not present in other stores, that

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.740
is, the consumer did not understand

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.940
its real value or value and a simple

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.460
example you go to the store of household

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.480
appliances to buy a hair dryer and

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.780
on the showcase pay attention to

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:04.520
that there is a hair dryer for

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.620
one and a half thousand rubles, but

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.300
almost the same but a little brighter,

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.900
with another unknown brand,

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.260
already for seven to eight

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.500
thousand rubles.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.380
For a thousand and a half

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.260
rubles, this is very

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.600
cheap.

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.320
You just asked a point

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.920
to compare the price.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.540
Vehicles or goods of

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.840
interrelated demand.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.860
We talked to you recently in the

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.980
section dedicated to the product range.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.240
That is, it is very

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.700
useful to set low prices on

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.240
goods that consumers regularly

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.700
take, but by purchasing these

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.480
goods, they take the rest

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.100
of the range, increasing your

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.080
sales.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.380
Contact products are goods that consumers

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.700
come to look at, often do

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.760
not buy, but they are interested

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.140
in seeing what they can not afford,

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.440
but they seduce the consumer

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.860
to the point of sale or to

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.500
you, to get acquainted

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.680
with this sample, in the near

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.440
future, such a product will

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.200
be a mobile phone from Apple,

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.560
iPhone.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:16.660
Sweets are extremely attractive

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.960
offers that consumers

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.580
are resorting to.

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.400
Such a strategy is used by discounters

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.180
in the field of household appliances,

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.840
regularly throwing some extremely

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.180
attractive offer on the market.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.080
This offer seduces consumers

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.300
into their shopping centers and already

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.420
further with them directly

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:47.500
sellers, the task of which is to

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.800
switch the customer from the

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.360
most attractive product, sweet

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.940
goods, to one that is more interesting

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.780
to sell shopping points.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.780
A competitive confrontation.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.940
You can fight not all

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.560
the range, but certain positions.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.960
So, not so long ago in

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.980
St. Petersburg, price wars unfolded,

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:13.900
where the tarantula became the candy

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:14.980
of Rafael.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.720
The price before them fell,

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.820
if I am not mistaken, to 76 rubles

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.340
per package at a normal fair price,

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.720
about 120 rubles per package.

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.260
Regularly, trade networks

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.120
are waging trade wars with

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.100
each other to demonstrate

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.580
low prices.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.560
But they do not lower the price for the entire range.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.380
They use only certain categories

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.440
or individual brands

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.180
for this.

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.720
What to do if you are being forced to go

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.660
to a price war?

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.280
It is better not to enter it at

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.740
all, because the price war

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.240
is devastating for the industry,

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.960
especially where there is

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.640
eligopolistic competition.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.420
In other words, companies that are equal in

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.880
force are fighting against each other.

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.740
And often for the principle of

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.520
fighting to the last, that led to

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.260
the bankruptcy of leading

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.340
players, from this benefit

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.400
other companies that have not previously

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.500
been present possible in these

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.460
markets, as in terms

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.500
of industry or geographical affiliation.

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:19.160
First of all, if you want to win

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.220
the war, you must prepare for it,

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:24.260
and for this it is necessary to discover

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:26.320
its strategic intentions and capabilities,

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.040
that is, the company must demonstrate

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.960
that in the event of a price

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.840
war it will fight to the last

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.740
and very hard, and has the

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.440
lowest level of costs of all

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.460
other players in the industry,

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.300
that is, it will be able

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.620
to offer prices below the

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:51.400
rest to its consumers.

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.000
Such an image tends to

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.800
keep other players from

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.780
unleashing a price war,

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.040
try to compete on quality.

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.840
If there is a price war, teach the

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.900
consumer to determine where the

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.560
quality products are, where

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:07.780
they are of poor quality.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.300
Set them a basis for comparison,

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.180
teach them.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.880
In this case, you can refrain from

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.840
participating in a price

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.340
war, losing slightly in sales.

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.180
Call for help and cooperation

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.580
in the event of a price war

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.540
of your customers.

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.960
Explain to them what may

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.420
lead to their desire to switch

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.180
to some currently more profitable

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.320
offers in the

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.080
long run.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.100
The government can also

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.160
seek protection from dumping.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.100
If there is still a price war,

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.200
try to use comprehensive

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.400
measures.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.480
Offer consumers for the same price

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.540
as before, two units of the product,

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.140
which corresponds to a 50% discount.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.880


01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.300
On the one hand, you provide a discount,

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.420
meaning you are competitive.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.340
On the other hand, you keep

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.320
your sales in cash, which

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.480
is very important, and you

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.360
do not allow consumers

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.660
to switch to competitors.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.040
Why is?

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.340
Because if he has formed

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.820
some stock of your products,

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.120
he will not buy the products

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.540
of competitors.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.820
Do not engage your base

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.800
brands or trademarks in price

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.960
warfare.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.540
In this case, it makes sense to create

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.760
a flanking brand.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.220
The brand is costly.

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:42.060
It will never pay off, but will

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.900
protect the main brand from distortion

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.680
of image or positioning breakdown.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.900
To engage the price war with the

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.200
flank brand, which protects

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.800
from lower prices, and your main

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.060
products you will be leading

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.900
the price manoeuvres.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.280
More and more, lowering prices

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.520
in the market, for this class of

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.900
products, yes, carrying losses,

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.760
but retaining again, I repeat, my

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.700
main brand.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:15.940
When prices fall to such a level

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.540
that it will not be interesting,

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.840
not attractive to continue the

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.600
war for all the other market participants,

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.840
they will not be able to return

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.380
the standard prices to their

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.500
base brands.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.140
Plus, the lower price leads to a decrease

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.740
in quality, which means consumers will

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.960
also turn away from them.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.740
Use simple price maneuver.

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.960
Try adding some complexity

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.200
or value in response to a price

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.500
drop, it’s much more attractive

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.480
in terms of the long-

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.520
term perspective.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.000
So, in order to lead a competent

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.220
war, you need to study a number

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.720
of questions, primarily related to

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.600
consumers, and whether prices

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.540
are really important for them,

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.460
whether you need to get involved

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.240
in a price war, and how much

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.540
you will reduce sales, or

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.720
increase sales in the event

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.060
of a price drop.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.240
The second question is what is the

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.580
cost structure of your company,

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.400
what positioning and in the long

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.140
term – how will you play

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.580
the situation after the price war?

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.140
Evaluate the behavior of key

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.880
players, not only competitors, but

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.920
government, suppliers, what you

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.100
may have allies, whether you can

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.260
resort to the help of an industry

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.380
association.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.580
In general, a broader view

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:37.760
allows to anticipate a much larger

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.060
range of possible actions.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.180
Assess questions related to competitors,

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.180
namely, what is their cost structure,

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.100
who will be able to last longer in

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.440
the conditions of price war,

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.080
and what will lead to a breakdown

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.920
of positioning.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.960
But, again, without repeating

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.020
all this, it is better not to

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.860
get caught up in a price war.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.140
So, we have considered with you a

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.980
block dedicated to pricing.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.640
All commercial and many

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.120
non-profit organizations

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.440
set prices on the goods or services

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.400
offered to consumers.

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.440
The basis of all prices is a single

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.740
concept of prices offered by the company.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.160
New technologies are bringing

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.880
back price-setting through

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.940
negotiations and revision of

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.580
fixed price practices.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.700
That is, the further you go, the

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.760
more flexible you will be in pricing.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.680
British Airways has

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:49.000
about 600 tariffs for

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.920
its tickets.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.580
For example, a passenger plane

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:58.240
with 300 seats can fly a full

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.580
plane at the same time, but neither

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.160
of the two passengers will

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.600
have a ticket for the

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.480
same price.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.920
That is, the company sets prices

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.380
based on the time of purchase

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.940
of perceived value and many other

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.560
moments.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.560
The Internet, corporate networks

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.260
and other media devices connect

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.060
sellers and buyers around the world.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.720
As a rule, the company will equip

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.440
a system of prices for the

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.580
product, which is influenced by many factors.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.180
That is, pricing is a matter of

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.640
the entire marketing mix and the

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.780
company’s strategy.
