00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, my name is Andrey Kulinich and we are starting to discuss the topic of price education.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What is the price?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the price system, the price is the total amount of benefits from the product or service that you offer.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Benefits include both material and non-material benefits, divided by the total amount of costs of the buyer, both monetary and non-monetary.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The costs include changes in the finished products in accordance with the characteristics of the new supplier's products,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
changes in the usual way of consumption or use of the product, costs related to training of the staff, and so on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000


00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The price is the only element of the marketing mix that generates profit, while the rest determine the company's costs.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The price is also the most flexible element, and unlike the characteristics of the product and marketing channels, it can be quickly changed.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Price competition is one of the main problems of most companies.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It is difficult to exaggerate the role of the price in the marketing mix.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We have already said that the price is the only thing that generates profit for the company, while the rest are costs.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The price transforms the value created for the consumer into the company's income.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The price is one of the most flexible elements, it is easiest to change it, thus changing the position of the company in the market.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The price informs the market the value of your brand or product.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The perception of price and quality is closely related, and we will talk about it a little later.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The price is one of the most important criteria of the consumer's choice.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The price determines your share of the market and the rate of growth of sales.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The price is not only what is drawn on the price list or in the price list.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The price is the loan conditions, the discounts you provide with the product,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the flexibility of price formation depending on the volumes or other conditions of the purchase of the product,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
geographical parameters, i.e. how the price depends on the region of sale of the product,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the initial price and possible steps to reduce it,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the time of payment and much more.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
All these parameters form the concept of price.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If we talk about price formation, it is important to understand the company's goals.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What are we focused on? What is the most relevant for the company at the moment?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
If we are focused on profit, then, as a rule, the target income is established,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and based on it we form the price for our product or service.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If we are focused on sales, then, accordingly, our goals are the growth of the market share and the growth of sales volumes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Accordingly, this is another approach to price formation.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Another goal can be the orientation to the preservation of the status quo, i.e. your position in the market.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Accordingly, we are focused on the direct competition and non-price competition with our partners, if we can say so, in the market.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Both external and internal factors affect the price formation in the company.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The internal factors include the company's goals and strategies,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the marketing goals of the company, the level of costs associated with the production of the product or service,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000
as well as the company's management methods, because they also significantly affect the cost of the product in terms of costs.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
External factors include the type of competition that exists in the market,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the prices and offers of competitors, as well as their activity,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the characteristics of demand, in particular, the elasticity in price,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
who participates in the promotion or promotion of the product from the manufacturer to the end consumer,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
namely, the participants from the household channel,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
as well as the factors of the environment, in particular, the payment capacity of the population.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The price formation strategies can be divided into two axes.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Pay attention to the slide.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In particular, we consider the price formation strategies in the axes of price and product quality.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Of course, the most optimal is the strategy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This is a high-quality, high-price, namely, the premium price strategy.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The average quality, the average price is the average price strategy,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
or low-quality, low-price is the economy strategy.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Nevertheless, there may be other variations.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
For example, the average price is high-quality,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
accordingly, it is the high-price strategy.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
That is, we try to be similar or justify our offers on the market for the consumer.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It can be low-quality, high-price.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Such a strategy is called the robbery price strategy.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The price formation depends on the positioning of your company.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We will touch on this a little later.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
For example, the matrix of positioning in two axes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This is the price requested for the product and the value perceived by the consumer.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The most optimal is the location of the product on the diagonal,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
when the price requested corresponds to the value perceived by the product or service offered to the consumer.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
If we are above the diagonal,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
this zone is called the missed opportunity.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That is, you request a price that is too high,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and your sales will not be as great as they could be.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
On the other hand, if we offer a higher value perceived for a lower price,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
this is an unpaid profit for the company,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and the company has no opportunity to develop its offer further.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
That is, to develop.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
For example, to illustrate.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Let's consider washing powders.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
As a product, it is most familiar to everyone.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The high price, the high value perceived is the washing powder of the Ariel Persil class.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000
At the same time, at the bottom, diagonally, there will be powders, for example, under the brand DOSIA.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
That is, the price formation of the company is produced on powders, depending on how we perceive.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Intermediate products should be ideally located on the diagonal between DOSIA and Ariel powder.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
If we want to build a price formation policy, we need to go through a number of stages.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Pay attention to the slide.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Stage 1. This is the task setting of the price formation.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Stage 2. Determining the demand.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Stage 3. Evaluation of costs associated with the production of a product or service.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Stage 4. Analysis of costs, prices and offers of competitors.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Stage 5. Choice of price formation method.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And stage 6. The final stage is the final price formation.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Let's take a closer look at each of the stages.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
At the first stage, we must formulate the tasks that are before the companies.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Within the framework of which we will build our price formation.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The tasks can be completely different.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
For example, survival.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:27.000
In this case, we will build a price formation policy in such a way to ensure the minimum level of the company's life expectancy on the market, to extend it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It can be maximization of the current profit or selling, in other words, selling the share of the company on the market.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
In this case, we have a completely different price formation strategy.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000
That is, before starting the price formation, you must clearly explain what goals are currently before the company.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The second stage. We must determine how sensitive our consumer is to the price.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
In this case, we must consider at least 9 factors.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The first factor. Does the product have distinctive, bright, distinctive features?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The more unique your product or service is, the less you should focus on competitors, and the less your consumers will be sensitive to the established price.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:21.000
The second stage. How informed are consumers about the availability of substitutes or similar products?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Here, an example is the increase in our price sensitivity with a deeper understanding of the household appliances market.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:43.000
At the moment, we choose the product of long-term demand that we need, and only then we purchase it at the point where it is cheapest.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Although at first we had certain fears and risks associated with the fact that we would buy a low-quality product, we would buy a product with those characteristics.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But the ability to address your own experience, to examine the opinions of friends and acquaintances, consumers who left their opinions on the Internet, makes us more and more sensitive to the price.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The third factor. Is there an opportunity to compare or compare your offer with the offers of competitors?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:27.000
For example, if you chose a tariff from a cell operator, you probably noticed that it is extremely difficult to compare not only the tariffs of two different operators, but also the tariffs even within the framework of one operator.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
At some point, we refused the idea of ​​rational decision-making and went into the field of emotions.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Accordingly, we were less sensitive to the price.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The same situation is observed when purchasing, for example, cars, laptops and other goods.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
How much does the consumption of this type of goods take up a significant part of the consumer's budget?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
If these are not significant expenses, then we pay less attention to the price.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Do you remember how much matches cost?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I do not.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Accordingly, no matter what price we are offered, within the framework of a reasonable price, we will consider it reasonable.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
The final benefit effect.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
An interesting factor.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000
What value does your offer or product create for the consumer?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000
For example, in the market of consulting services, price education is often not based on labor costs, but on the benefit that the client will receive.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.000
If the client's income is tens of millions of dollars, then it is unlikely that the consultant will provide a service for $ 1,000-2,000.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Most likely, the price will be much higher and the client will purchase, because he will get much more profit than his expenses associated with this service.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
The sixth factor.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Does someone else bear part of the costs associated with the purchase?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:03.000
For example, was a grant allocated, was there any assistance from the state to a particular enterprise to purchase production equipment?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
If such assistance is provided, then, as a rule, we become less sensitive to the price.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The seventh factor.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Is there a possibility of using the product together with existing goods?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
When purchasing accessories, we often do not think about their price, although the accessory to a cell phone is not cheap.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Nevertheless, having a prestigious mobile phone, we will purchase only certain goods or services that can work with this phone.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Accordingly, the price of accessories can be higher, because the consumer is less sensitive to the price.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The price as an indicator of a higher quality of the product.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Everything is simple here.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Please note that if I offer you to buy a Patek Philippe watch for $ 700-800 at their normal average price of $ 20-25,000,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000
it is unlikely that you will perceive this offer as a real watch, even if they are at least 10 times real.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
The price-quality ratio is a very important factor.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
We focus primarily on the price, giving a conclusion about the quality of the product.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Here I have a very interesting example related to manipulation.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Manipulation of consumers.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
One of the manufacturers we recommended to fit their basic product in a cheaper packaging.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
This packaging was necessary to create a flagship brand in the face of a price war.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But in order not to create a new product, we thought it was profitable to offer the same content in both the more expensive and cheaper versions.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The only thing that changed was the packaging and, of course, the price.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Now, often, when I am in front of a choice, in front of a shop, and I know that both boxes contain the same product,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I hardly persuade myself to take a cheaper offer, since I perceive the quality as lower, and I know that the content is the same.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Factor 9. Consumers do not have the opportunity to store the product.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It's very simple. If you can't store a product, it will be spoiled quickly, and you can't create a stock of this product and stop buying it for a while.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
For example, the increase in electricity prices.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Who among us can store electricity?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Nobody, but everyone needs it, and we will pay the price that we are called.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
At the same time, when Poland joined the EU, a paradoxical situation arose.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:57.000
When entering, prices for a number of basic products, such as sugar and flour, should have risen.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The population began to stock up on these products in good time.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
That is, they took the hypermarkets by storm, made huge stocks.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:16.000
After the moment of entry, the sales of sugar and flour dropped dramatically, they actually fell to zero.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the suppliers were forced to lower prices to somehow stimulate demand.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That is, by creating a stock, the population was protected from a sharp increase in prices.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It became more sensitive to the price offer for these food products.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The second stage is the determination of demand.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
In particular, we need to determine how elastic our demand is.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
You will see the concept of price elasticity in more detail in the course of the economy.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Nevertheless, a few words.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Elastic demand is when, when the price changes, there is a significant fluctuation in the consumption of a given product or service.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That is, if prices rise, consumption decreases, and vice versa, if prices fall, consumption of a product or service increases.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Elastic demand is calculated according to the formula.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:21.000
This is the change in the amount of goods, consumption of goods in percents divided by the change in the percents of the price of a given product.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000
In the case when the elastic demand coefficient is greater than one, it is considered that the demand is elastic.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
In the case when the elastic demand coefficient is less than one, it is considered that the demand is not elastic.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Cross-elasticity is a separate term.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
This is when the change in prices affects the change in consumption of another brand or product.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
How to determine the price elasticity?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
There are a number of approaches.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.000
First of all, an expert assessment, which is based on the factors that we listed in the previous step.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
The second step or the second method is the purchase survey.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:15.000
We will discuss one of the methods that allows us to determine the dependence of the volume of the sale of a given product on the price.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
The third method is price experiments, namely, temporary discounts on individual products,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
different prices on the same territory, for example, in different shopping centers.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:37.000
This is the use of the Internet and the assessment of the demand level for your products in various Internet stores.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
The last method is the analysis of the actual data.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000
We look at how historically the demand for your product has changed depending on the change in price.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000
The main factors that affect the price elasticity are the reference price effect,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
that is, how much consumers are aware of the prices for a given product or service.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:12.000
As another example, I can give the price of high-tech goods in the United States and Russia.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
For example, at one time, these prices were two or more times higher for complex household appliances,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
at that time video tape recorders, TVs, computers.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000
But with the advent of the Internet, it is much easier for me to specify the price in the United States for this product

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
than to go to the store by road.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I can do this without leaving my workplace or without leaving the house.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Accordingly, seeing a significant price difference, I will consider the offer unfair for various reasons.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
But the main one is the unfairness of the established price.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I will refuse to purchase this product in Russia.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But such a moment can be applied only to goods or services that I can transfer from one continent to another in a private order.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
The effect of complexity and comparison, which we have already discussed,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
the effect and cost of switching is a very important point,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
which is more typical for the B2B area.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
If you have a factory or a manufacturing plant,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and you install some equipment,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
then it is often impossible to switch to other consumables.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
They just do not fit, do not connect with your equipment.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And accordingly, no matter what offer you were offered,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
it is much more expensive and more difficult to replace the equipment

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
than to continue to pay the established, albeit unfair, price.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
The effect of price-quality is how we perceive the cost in relation to some objective characteristics.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
This effect does not work in the consumer market,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
but it has perfectly recommended itself in the industrial markets.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000
For example, you offer pipes that are twice as expensive as those purchased by the women's utility industry,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
but at the same time the service life of these pipes is four times longer.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.000
We can very clearly compare the price, quality and, accordingly, benefits of the end consumer.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
The effect of expenses, the share in the structure of your consumer's expenses,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
the effect of the end benefit,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
we also talked about this and gave an example from the construction practice,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
the effect of a fair price,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
in this case, this is the effect of the perception of the consumer of the reasonableness of your price,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
and the framework effect,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:55.000
in particular, what losses or benefits can the consumer acquire in the event of a mistake, a wrong choice.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
When you buy a chewing gum, you do not think that your expenses can be extremely large,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
you did not like it, you threw it away,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
accordingly, you think less about the price and the choice you make.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
These can be combinations of benefits or losses, including the effect of creating a stock.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000
The third stage is related to the assessment of costs associated with the production of a product

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
or the cost of providing services.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
In particular, we need to highlight the constant overhead costs,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
variable and full costs associated with a given product or service.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
You will learn more about these concepts in the course of finance.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
We need to assess how our expenses will change depending on the accumulated experience effect.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
The experience effect is a reduction in the price by a certain set percentage when the volume of the product is doubled.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Pay attention to the slide, it demonstrates a reduction in cost-benefit ratio taking into account the experience effect,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
that is, historically produced products.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.000
For example, some Western companies start selling products at prices much higher than the cost of production at the first stage,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
but then, having accumulated the experience effect, they get a significant reduction in the cost of production

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and start earning on this product or service.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
The fourth stage is the analysis of the costs and offers of competitors,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
that is, what offers the market makes or your competitors can make.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
If the offer of a company is not much different from the offer of a competitor,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
that is, there is no uniqueness in your product or service,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000
then the price for the product should be about the same as the price for the product of your competitors.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
If the offer of a company is inferior in quality,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
then it simply has no possibility to set a higher price than that of competitors,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:11.000
or this action will have only a temporary nature with a subsequent sharp drop in demand for the product or service.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
If the offered product is superior to the product of the competitor,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
then you can, accordingly, set a higher price for your product.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
But it is important to remember that the consumer should know about the superiority of your product,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
not only you or your competitors.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The fifth stage is the selection of a price method that we will use for a long time.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Here we need to take into account a number of points.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
For example, a low starting price is the absence of profit for the enterprise.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
If we set higher prices, we may not get enough demand for our product.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
The first price method is the cost plus increase method.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Pay attention to the slide.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
We have certain data.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Variable costs per unit of the product are $10.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Constant costs associated with the production of this product are $300,000.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
The estimated sales volume per unit is $50,000.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
We must calculate the costs of production of a unit of the product,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
taking into account the constant costs.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
That is, we must add the constant costs to the unit of the product by $10.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
In this case, the cost will be $16.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
The target increase is 20%.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
We must divide this cost by the unit of minus 0.2

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
and the target price based on this method will be $20.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
The method is very simple and clear,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
but it does not take into account a number of market factors,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
including the prices of competitors.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
It does not take into account the possibility of losing profit

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
if you set too low a price,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
or vice versa, not to get the necessary sales volume at a higher price.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
The next method is the price calculation method based on the target profit rate.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
In this case, it is an economic calculation,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000
where we operate with parameters such as the cost,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
which includes constant variable costs,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
and the sales volume.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
We try to determine the necessary profit volume,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
that is, we set a price based on the necessary profit volume.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
The starting price affects the profitability of the product,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
and this must be taken into account in this method of pricing.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Pay attention to the slide, this is a closed system.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
As soon as you increase some costs,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
for example, the volume of advertising,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
or you strive to stimulate more sellers,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
this increases the costs of the product,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
thereby reducing the total margin.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Therefore, when setting prices based on this method,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
you need to take into account all the actions of the company.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
As a rule, this method is not, again, for the most part, market-oriented,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
and as the first method we have considered,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
it is used only to confirm the basis of prices,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
which we will determine by other methods.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
The third method is to set a price based on the perceived value of the product.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
In this case, we conduct certain marketing studies

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
in order to get feedback from consumers

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
about the price they consider fair for this product or service.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000
We will talk a little more about one of the methods of conducting these studies below.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Pricing is based on the real value of the product.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
In this case, we use the approach of price-quality,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
when we set a price based on the price-quality ratio of our product

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
or on the basis of the benefit that the consumer will receive.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Here are some examples that we have considered a little higher,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
in particular, about pipes and consulting.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
The price is set according to the current price level.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
In this case, you can consider a number of approaches.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
For example, market leader research,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
when we set our price to a certain percent higher or lower than the price of the market leader.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
But in this case, it is important to consider that you are completely dependent on this leader

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
and will involuntarily repeat his actions.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
It is important to understand that people also work for the market leader,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
and people tend to make mistakes, and there are quite a lot of such examples.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
In particular, you can consider an approach,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
when you set the price based not on one competitor, but on a number of competitors.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
That is, you set a certain methodology,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
when you take the price of a certain type of product of one competitor,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
of the second, third and fourth,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
and set your price based on the average price that you will receive.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
That is, the sum of prices for the product of competitors

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
divided by the number of competitors that you have considered.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
In this case, you are less bound to the mistakes of one of your competitors in the market,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
and you have the opportunity to keep the average market price.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
This does not mean that you need to set the price as it turned out during the calculation.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
No, you can be, for example, 5% lower than the average price received by the market,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
or 10% higher than this price.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
The purpose of price on the market.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
We do not mean only holding auctions or tenders for the purchase of a product.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
We can also use the calculation method based on the theory of probability.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
For example, pay attention to the slide.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
We have a table where one of the columns is the competitive price,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
that is, the price that we want to set for this product.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
This is an assessment of the effectiveness, that is, profitability of this product.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
This is the probability of receiving an order at this price in percents.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And the expected ROI is the ROI of our product multiplied by the probability.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Accordingly, the probability is assessed by an expert,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
or based on the analysis of the market.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And we focus on maximizing the expected ROI,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
that is, the ROI of the product multiplied by the probability.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000
In this case, the most optimal choice for us is the cost of $ 3 per unit of production.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:02.000
These methods are described in more detail in the works of the last two Nobel laureates in the field of economics.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
The sixth stage is the final setting of the price of the product.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
We must take into account the psychology of our consumer.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Here we collect all the material that we have accumulated in the previous stages.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
This includes positioning, the perception of the quality of the product,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
and the number at which our price should end.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
For example, even numbers always confuse consumers, they seem artificial.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
But if you buy a car and you are asked to set a price of $ 30,000,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
it will certainly raise questions.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
But at the same time, even the cost of a car at $ 31,000 is $ 278,000,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
or even better, with cents,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
and it will seem fair,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
it is obtained as a result of reasonable calculations.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
We must take into account such things as the quality of the trade market,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
the level of competition and the type of competition that exists in the market.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
We must take into account the knowledge of our product to consumers,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
the knowledge of the consumer characteristics of our offer.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Based on these elements of the marketing mix,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
the final price for the product is set.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
In particular, in the slide you can pay attention

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
to how much the changes in the area of the popularity of the trade brand,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
the volume of the advertising budget,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
and the perceived quality of the product affect the cost of your product.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
For example, with low quality of the product,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
but in low advertising costs,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
the price will be $ 100.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
At the same time, another extreme is high perceived quality,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
and large advertising budgets allow to set the maximum price

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
in the amount of $ 300 for a similar product.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
At the same time, medium quality and high advertising costs

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
for the promotion of the product allow to double the price from the original.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Accordingly, pay attention to what parameters

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
or what goals were set in other elements of the marketing mix.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
An important parameter of price formation is also the way

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
of delivering the product to the end consumer.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
You must take into account the chain of goods movement,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
the existing margin or the optimal profit for the participants in this chain.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
You must pay attention to the legislative acts of the government

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
in the area of price formation.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
You must focus on suppliers or possible changes in prices

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
from the suppliers' side, competitors,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
as well as on the trading staff that is stimulated

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
or motivated by the cost of your product.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Accordingly, price formation absorbs all that you have provided

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
before designing the marketing mix of your company.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
We promised to consider in more detail one of the ways

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
of market research to determine the optimal price.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
The method is called Price Sensitivity Measurement

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
and is based on a number of questions that we ask the consumer.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
The consumer is described characteristics or the product is demonstrated.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
In our case, we use the washing machine of Ordo,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
where the number of washing modes, drying mode,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
delicate washing mode, warranty and other characteristics are indicated.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
We ask the consumer a number of questions.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
What do you think, what is the price for this washing machine

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
that is so high that you would not buy it?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
What is the minimum price for this washing machine

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
that you think is high but you can still buy it?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
What is the price for this washing machine

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
that you think is a very profitable purchase?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
It is important to note that this survey can be conducted

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
only among respondents who are currently before the election

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
and are guided by the product you are conducting the survey about.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
As a result, we can build a graph

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:52.000
where we get four lines based on the questions we received

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000
and two more lines are the number of responses of respondents.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
It is customary to highlight four points on this graph,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
including the point of indifference,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
which is the price that is considered acceptable by the largest number of consumers.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
This is the point of the optimal price,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
where the smallest number of people reject the product

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
because of its high price.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
The point of the optimal low price,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
where the question of the quality of your offer will arise.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And the point of the optimal high price,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
where the share of buyers who refuse to buy this product

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
increases significantly.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Based on the results,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
based on the strategy of the company,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
its position on the market and other parameters,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
you can choose the most optimal option.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
The position of the product on the market.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
For example, if the product is for special occasions,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000
such as cakes, champagne, wedding rings,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
then the price for this product or service can be quite high.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
If we need a product like a beacon,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
which we will talk about later,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
which is responsible for the price level of our product,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
then it can be the price of a losing leader, etc.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
It is important to consider that for a number of regions or a number of our clients

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
we can use discrimination pricing.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Discrimination pricing is the stimulation of the behavior we need

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
from the consumers.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Pay attention to the slide.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
In this case, the equivalent of water under the brand Avian

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
is 1.5 liters.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
If we buy it in one bottle,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
the price will be about $ 2.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
If we buy it in small bottles of 50 grams,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
then the price for this water will be $ 6.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
That is, the manufacturer stimulates the consumer

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
to buy the product in the most profitable packaging for him.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Accordingly, discrimination pricing can be used

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
to account for the location of the product.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
For example, alcoholic beverages in the store are much cheaper than in a restaurant.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Taking into account the time,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
some goods or services at night are much more expensive.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Taking into account the image of the product,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
in order to support and position many goods,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
a higher price is set.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
That is, to emphasize the status of this product.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
When pricing, we must also consider

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
where our product, on which we now set the price,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
is within the product line,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
what role it plays.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
We must consider

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
what additional devices or services

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
may be needed by the consumer in connection with his purchase.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
We must take into account the prices

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
and also immediately set auxiliary accessories.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
In particular, a bright example is a car.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
There we will need a lot of different accessories

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
to make the use of life comfortable.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
The price is set from two components.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
For example, initial cost and subsequent payments.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
The price is set for side products.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
In order to minimize waste,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
we can sell them in a series

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
as a kind of raw material for the subsequent user.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And the package price is set for a set.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
For example, you buy not one shampoo,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
but a shampoo, shower gel and a wet wipe.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Variable prices affect the overall performance of the enterprise.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Pay attention to the slide.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
The following factors affect the enterprise.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
The price and the quality of the product

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
and the selective reduction of the number of customers

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
will lead to a reduction of the market share

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
and to a reduction in the company's overall profit.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
The price and the quality of the product

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
will lead to a reduction of the market share

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
and to a reduction of the market share

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
and to a reduction of the company's overall profit.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
The price and the quality of the product

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
will lead to an increase of the market share

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
and to a reduction of the market share.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
In the long term, however,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
the profit will continue to rise.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
The price and the quality of the product

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
will lead to a reduction of the market share

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
and the short-term reduction of the profit

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
and its long-term growth.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
The increase in the price of a certain product

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
unaffected its quality will lead to the mantainment

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
of the market share and profitability

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
of an economic part of the company.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Of course, that has to do with the competition.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
An increase in the price of some products

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
in common quality will lead to maintaining

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
the product share, the incoming profit

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
and promotion of the company.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
The price and quality recession

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
will lead to the loss

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
of the market share,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
the incoming profit and the decrease

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
in the long-term profit.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
The continuation of the new economic model,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
that is, to offer something new,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
innovations.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
On the one hand, introducing new products

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
into the range is a risk of cannibalism

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
when this product will gain sales

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
due to other products

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
in your range.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
But it can potentially lead

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
to an increase in the volume of sales.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Here you should soberly assess all the risks

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
and positioning of your products

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
within the range.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Now the question is how to set prices

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
for new products.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
If the product is really new,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
then, as a rule,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
the strategy of removing the cream is used.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
That is, initially a higher price,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
yes, let it be available only at the top

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
of the consumer pyramid,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
that is, to the most affluent people,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
and then, over time,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
it decreases so that we can

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
capture more and more consumers

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
and make the product available to them.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
In this case, we get the opportunity

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
to maintain profitability for a longer time,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
gradual increase in power

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
and less risk associated with the withdrawal

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
of this product.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
The negative aspects include

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
a small volume of sales

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
at the time of the product's release,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
but on the other hand,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
the price of each sale is not so high.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
If we talk about the strategy of penetration,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
then, as a rule,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
it is already used

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
when the products are withdrawn,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
the analogues of which exist on the market.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
The strategy of price penetration

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
is when the lowest price is set

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
and, due to this,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
the company quickly buys

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
the share of the market.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
At the same time,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
the disadvantages include

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
significant difficulties,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
such as raising prices

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
for your goods or services,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
because consumers do not consider them fair

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
and refuse to buy them.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Such cases have happened many times

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
on the market

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
when federal companies

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
entered the region,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
when the price of penetration

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
initially increased,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
and after a while,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
the volume of sales

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
fell to zero.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
The neutral strategy

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
is when the price is high

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
and the price is low.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
If the price is high,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
then this strategy

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
will not allow you

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
to enter the market effectively

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
and can be used

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
only when your product

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
is significantly unique.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
It is also necessary to consider

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
the possibility of price changes,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
in particular,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
the initiative price changes

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
that occur

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
when the production is low

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
or the market share falls

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
to increase it,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
or during economic declines

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
to overload production.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Price increases

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
are usually a process of inflation,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
the price is adjusted

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
to the percent of inflation,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
or the reduction

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
of surplus demand,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
that is, when there is a deficit

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
on the market,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
you should not miss

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
the opportunity to get

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
additional profit

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
or the growth of costs.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
The most striking example

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
is the increase in the cost of energy

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
carriers, which takes a significant

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
share in the cost of almost any product.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
You should be ready

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
for such actions

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
and provide them with price policy

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
of your company.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
The price change is a reaction

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
to the actions

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
of the competitor.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
As a rule, it is a price attack.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Here you should answer

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
a number of questions.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Why did they change the price?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Is it a temporary or permanent

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
price reduction?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Do they get rid of the stock remains

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
or do they have overloaded areas?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
What will be the actions

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
of other competitors?

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Thus, the price strategy

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
depends on the life cycle

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
of the product or the market.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
In the initial stages,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
the price is set

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
according to the strategy of removing the cream.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
As a rule, it does not change

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
drastically until the market

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
grows fast enough.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
At the same time,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
in mature markets,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
when consumers are better aware

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
of the characteristics

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
of your offer,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
the offer of competitors,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
a strategy similar to the price

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
of the competitor is used.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
When the market is out of stock,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
the price is reduced

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
and the demand is reduced,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
the strategy of penetration is used.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
The lower the price,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
the longer you can stay in the market.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
It is important not to forget

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
the need to adapt the prices.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
In particular, the price adaptation

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
is based on the geographical sign.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
If logistics in the Far East

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
takes up a significant share

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
of the cost of your product,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
the prices will be higher.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
You should anticipate

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
the price adaptation,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
the establishment of discounts

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
and various mutual accounts.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
You should anticipate

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
the price education

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
based on certain actions

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
to stimulate the sale

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
of seasonal discounts.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Discrimination price education

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
in order to

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
cut off

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
some of the consumers,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
for example.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Price education within

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
the marketing mix,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
which we have already discussed.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Price adaptation is the change

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
of price taking into account

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
the difference in demand

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
and the perceived value of the product.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
The adaptation allows you

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
to increase the profit

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
or increase the share of the market.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
In particular, when adapting,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
you should consider the following parameters

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
as the possibility of identification

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
of buyers, differentiation

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
of your product line

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
and the number of products

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
that are contained in your product portfolio.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
These products did not compete

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
with each other for the consumer's wallet.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
You should consider the situation

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
of buying or using the product.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
In particular,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
a classic example is

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
the establishment of pregnancy testing prices.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
When one of the companies

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
studied the behavior of consumers

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
and found an interesting fact

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
that those for whom

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
this pregnancy is desirable

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
are looking for pregnancy testing

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
in the order zone

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
and the price factor

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
is not important for them,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
but the package

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
is important.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
At the same time,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
those for whom

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
this pregnancy is,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
let's say, unexpected,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
are looking for pregnancy testing

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
in the zone

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
where the contraceptives

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
are laid out.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
The company packed the same test

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
in two different packages

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
and set different prices.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
In the order zone

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
there were tests

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
in a bright,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
noticeable package

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
at a high price

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
and a dark, inconspicuous package

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
at a low price

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
in the zone

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
where the contraceptives

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
were laid out.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Also,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
considering the features

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
of the deal

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
you make with your partners,

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
for example,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
in the industrial segment

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
at the end of the first deal

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
you can make some concessions

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
to prove

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
that you are a reliable

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
and worthy supplier.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Discounts and price cuts.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
You can offer discounts

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
for the amount of sales per month,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
for the volume of the once-purchase.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Discounts can be seasonal,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
in particular in the fashion industry

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
it has become a tradition.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Discounts are timed

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
to a special event,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
a birthday of the company

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
or

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
a national holiday.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Promotion fees

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
when you provide the product

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
as a bonus

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
to your best partners

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
and set prices

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
for the product exchange

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
or barter.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Discrimination

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
can be, as we said,

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
based on the segment of the consumer,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
on the different versions of the product,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
in particular, the newer versions

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
of the car are sold at a higher price,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
the place of sale,

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
the geographical difference

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
and the time of sale.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
You should take into account

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
when setting the price

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
the psychology of the consumer,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
that is,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
the price is comfortable for the consumer.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
A vivid example

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
is the usual

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
price ending at 99.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
These are the prices

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
set on Ford Focus

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
lower than

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
many Korean and Chinese

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
cars, but this is the base price.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
When you start purchasing additional equipment,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
everything will return to its place.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
And the geographical principle.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
If you need

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
to lower the sensitivity of the consumer

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
to the price,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
you have a number of ways.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
In particular,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
you have all seen the advertisement

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
about a car

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
from $200.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
In this case,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
the cost of not

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
the car itself,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
but the monthly payment

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
is indicated,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
or the cost of the first

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
wear can be indicated,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
which significantly reduces the sensitivity

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
You can change the amount of the product

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
or

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
the service that you provide

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
to the customer.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
This is how products

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
appear in a cardboard box,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
which weigh 685 grams,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
537 grams,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
and so on.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
That is, leaving a certain volume,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
a certain volume,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
the amount of goods in this box

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
decreases.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
The change in the quality of the provided product or service.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
When

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
the market

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
reaches its final stage,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
certain price maneuvers

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
begin between

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
competitors.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
In this case, in order to ensure

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
the price penetration,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
it is necessary to reduce the quality of the product,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
that is, to reduce its costs.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
The change in discounts and prices

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
is also perceived differently by consumers.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
In particular,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
some shops

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
in the jewelry business

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
offer discounts

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
from 40 to 60 percent.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
And consumers

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
cannot compare prices

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
and go for the significant amount

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
of discount that they may potentially

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
be provided.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
But in fact, they pay a full price

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
for this product.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Changing the time and place of

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
the right of ownership

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
is also an interesting point.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
In particular, working with one of the telecoms

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
companies, I came across

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
the fact that they had extremely high prices

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
for the allocated channels of access

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
to the Internet by DSL technology.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
When I asked,

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
do you sell anything at all?

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
He said, yes, and a lot.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
How? We provide free equipment

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
and channels for testing to the consumer.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
To my question,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
what percentage of returns

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
of equipment?

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
I was surprised.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
There is no return.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Consumers, after testing this technology,

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
refuse to return it.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
They are already used to it.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
They consider this equipment

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
as their own.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Changing the place and time of payment

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
is a vivid example.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
It is, again, an increase in demand

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
for cars after

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
auto loans became available.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Changing the form of payment.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
We all noticed that

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
money with a debit or credit

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
payment card

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
is much faster than with a pocket.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
We do not realize it,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
we do not control it.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Therefore, the appearance of terminals,

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
payment terminals,

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
can potentially increase the volume

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
of once-purchases in your store.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Let's understand that there are

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
other ways of manipulating

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
the consumer.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
In particular, there is a class of goods

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
that I call the beacons.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
In the US,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
in hypermarkets,

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola drinks

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
are sold below the purchase cost

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
in order to demonstrate

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
that all other prices

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
in the store are also low.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
With such price maneuvers

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
you can also encounter

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
in our retail trade.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
When the price of a certain type of product

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
is extremely low

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
on the advertising,

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
when extremely low prices

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
are set for the reference

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
group,

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
and prices are literally

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
for 7-8 types of goods.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
For men,

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
as a rule, cigarettes,

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
beer,

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
women,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
which are associated with food,

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
are the ones that are related to

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
these prices.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
We evaluate the level of

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
the price of the entire retail store.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
To check,

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
go to the bar.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
A large area where

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
a lot of goods are sold.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Pay attention

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
to where your eyes first ran.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
What goods

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
do you evaluate

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
the price level of

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
the entire retail store?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Thus, by reducing

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
certain groups of goods

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
prices that consumers

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
remember and evaluate

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
in the retail store,

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
you can create a general image

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
of your enterprise,

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
which is either low

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
or very expensive.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
In the industrial segment,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
as a rule, buyers also do not remember

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
the prices for the entire range.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
They are guided by certain

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
landmark goods.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
In the furniture industry,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
this is a table of 1.20 by 70,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
a roll-up bed and a rack.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
According to the total cost

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
of this set,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
the level of the price

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
of the entire collection is evaluated.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
The goods of the corner.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
As a rule, they are not sold.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
They are set to a point of comparison.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
A simple example.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
When you came

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
to the retail store

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
to make a purchase,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
we never buy the first offer.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Why?

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
It is important for us to compare

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
how expensive it is,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
how cheap it is.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
In these cases, it is sometimes useful

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
for the consumer to set this point of comparison.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
At the highest price,

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
it is desirable that this product

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
is not present in other retail stores.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
That is, the consumer does not understand

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
its real cost or value.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
A simple example.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
You go to the household appliances store

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
in order to purchase

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
a hair dryer.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
And on the showcase,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
note that there is a hair dryer

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
for 1,500 rubles.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Well, almost the same,

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
but a little brighter.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
A different brand

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
for 7-8 thousand rubles.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
You will say,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
this one for 1,500 rubles

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
is extremely cheap.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
You were just asked

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
to set a point of comparison

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
with the price.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Trains or goods of interrelated demand.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
We talked with you a little earlier

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
in the section dedicated to the product range.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
It is very useful to set low prices

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
for goods that are regularly

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
taken by consumers,

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
but when they buy these goods,

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
they take the whole other range,

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
increasing your sales.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Contactor goods

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
are goods that

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
consumers come to look at,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
often do not buy,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
but they are interested

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
to see what they can not afford.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
But they lure the consumer

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
to the point of sale

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
or to you.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Get acquainted with this sample.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
In particular,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
in the near future,

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
such a product may become

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
a mobile phone from Apple

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
or iPhone.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Sweet goods.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
This is an extremely attractive

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
offer that

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
consumers flock to.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Such a strategy is used

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
by discounters

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
in the field of

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
household appliances,

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
regularly

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
throwing out to the market

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
extremely attractive offers.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
This offer lures

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
consumers to their shopping centers

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
and then the sellers

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
work with them.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Their task

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
is to switch the client

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
from the most attractive

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
sweet goods to the one

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
that is more

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
interesting to sell

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
at the point of sale.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Competitive clashes.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Fight not all assortments,

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
but certain positions.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
So, not so long ago in St. Petersburg

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
price wars broke out,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
where

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Raffaello sweets

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
became a ram.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
The price for them fell, if I'm not mistaken,

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
to 76 rubles for packaging

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
at a normal fair price,

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
and about 120 rubles

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
for packaging.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Regularly, trading networks

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
turn trade wars between themselves

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
to lower the price level.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
But they do not reduce the price

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
for the whole range.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
They use only certain categories

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
or individual brands for this.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
What to do

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
if you are forced into a price war?

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
It is better not to enter it at all,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
because the price war is devastating

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
for the industry, especially

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
where there is

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
oligopolistic competition.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
That is, companies equal in strength

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
begin to fight each other.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Often, for the sake of principle,

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
they fight to the last,

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
which leads to bankruptcy of leading players.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Other companies

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
that have not been present

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
in these markets before

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
win from this,

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
both in terms of forestry

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
and geographical property.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
First of all,

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
if you want to win a war,

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
you have to prepare for it.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
And for this,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
you need to find

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
strategic intentions and opportunities.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
That is, the company must demonstrate

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
that in the event of a price war,

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
it will fight

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
to the last

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
and very hard

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
and has the lowest

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
level of costs

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
from all other players

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
in the industry.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
That is, it can offer

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
lower prices to its consumers

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
below the rest.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Such an image usually holds

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
other players

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
from starting a price war.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Try to compete

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
in quality.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
If a price war begins,

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
then teach consumers to determine

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
where the quality of the product is,

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
where it is not.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Set a base for comparison for them.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Teach them.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
In this case,

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
you can resist

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
participating in a price war,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
having lost a little in sales.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Call your clients

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
to help and cooperate

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
in the event of a price war.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Explain to them

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
what their desire

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
to switch

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
to some more profitable

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
offers in the long term

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
may lead to.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
You can also look for protection

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
from dumping

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
from government organizations.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
If a price war still occurs,

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
try to use complex measures.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Offer your customers

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
the same price

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
as before,

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
but with 2 units of goods,

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
for example,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
which corresponds to a 50% discount.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
On the one hand,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
you provide a discount,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
that is, you are competitive.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
On the other hand,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
you keep your sales volume

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
in the money equivalent,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
which is very important,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and do not allow consumers

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
to buy the goods of competitors.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Why? Because if a certain supply

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
of your product has been formed,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
then it will not buy

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
the product of competitors.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Do not participate in a price war

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
with your basic brands or trademarks.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
In this case,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
it makes sense to create a flanking brand.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Yes, the brand is initially expensive,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
it will never pay you back,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
but it will allow you

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
to protect the main brand

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
from distortion of the image

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
or positioning.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You will engage in a price war

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
with a flanking brand,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
which protects

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
from lower prices

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
your main product,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
you will conduct

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
price maneuvers with it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
More and more,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
lowering prices on the market

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
for this class of products,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
yes, incurring losses,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
but retaining,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I repeat, your main brand.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
When prices fall to such a level

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that it will become uninteresting

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and not attractive to continue the war

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
to all other participants of the market,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
they will not be able

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
to return standard prices

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
to their basic brands.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Plus, lowering prices leads

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
to lowering quality, as a rule,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
which means that consumers

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
will turn away from them.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Adopt a simple price maneuver.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Try to add

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
some complex or value

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
to the price reduction.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It is much more attractive

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
in the long term.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
So,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
to conduct a price war,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
you need to study a number of questions.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
First of all, they are related to consumers.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Are prices really important to them?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Should you engage in a price war?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
How much will your sales volume decrease

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
or increase

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
in case of price reduction?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The second question is

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
what is the structure of your

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
company?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
What is the positioning?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And in the long term,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
how will you play out the situation

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
after the price war?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Evaluate the behavior of the main participants,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
not only competitors,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
but also the government, suppliers,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
what kind of allies you may have,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
whether you can resort to

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
the help of a plant association.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
In general, a broader view

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
allows you to provide

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
a much larger range

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
of possible actions.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Evaluate the questions

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
related to the competitors,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
namely,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
what is their structure of costs,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
who will be able to last longer

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
in the conditions of the price war,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and what will the break

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
in the positioning lead to.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But, I will repeat once again,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
even if all this is not enough,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
it is better not to engage in a price war.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So, we have examined

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
a block dedicated to price education.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
All commercial and many non-commercial

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
organizations set prices

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
on the products or services

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
offered to consumers.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
The basis of all prices is a single concept,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
the price offered by the company.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
New technologies

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
return to the sphere of price setting

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
through negotiations

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
and go through the review of the practice

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
of the price set.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
The further, the more flexible

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
price education you will have.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
In particular, the British Airways company

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
uses about 600 tariffs

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
for its tickets.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
For example,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
in a passenger plane

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
with a capacity of 300 passengers,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
a full plane can fly at the same time,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
but not a single passenger

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
will not have a ticket

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
at the same price.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That is, the company

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
sets prices

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
based on the time of purchase,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
the perceived value

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and many other factors.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
The Internet, corporate networks

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and other media devices

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
connect sellers and buyers

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
around the world.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
As a rule, the company sets a system of prices

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
for the product,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
which is influenced by many factors.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
That is, price education

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
is a question of the whole marketing mix

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
and the company's strategy.
