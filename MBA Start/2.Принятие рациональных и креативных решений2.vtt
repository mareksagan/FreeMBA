00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hippocrates once said,

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
moderation is the mother of virtue.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Therefore, it is better to avoid this mistake,

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
not to collect more information than is necessary for making decisions.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Because collecting additional, sometimes unnecessary information,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
the use of a small number of people,

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
may require excessive attraction of resources,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
that is, it will be very expensive.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Another danger is that in this regard,

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
a very insignificant issue can be worked out, let's say,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
one of the sides of the problem,

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
and to solve really relevant problems or complex problems,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
there will be no resources or time.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Time, in principle, is also a resource.

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
And another interesting aspect is that

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
such a long, tedious study of the situation,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
a collection of a huge amount of information,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
in the end, can become unpleasant for a person

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
who is preparing a particular decision.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
He just gets tired of it and tries, in the end,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
to get away from all this,

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
giving the right to someone else to deal with the solution of this problem.

01:56.000 --> 02:07.000
And the last mistake is the desire to solve the easiest problems.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Because the more difficult the task,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
this is my point of view,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
the more serious the responsibility comes after making a decision.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
And many people are happy to deal with the easy, simple problems,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
which they probably know how to solve.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
But the solution of complex problems,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
problematic situations, and so on,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
is transferred to someone else.

02:40.000 --> 02:49.000
Sometimes this departure from complex problems can play a positive role,

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
but sooner or later,

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
your subordinates will understand that you are leaving the solution of complex,

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
complex, complex problems, and this threatens you with loss of influence.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
And as soon as your position, your influence,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
will be shaken, then very quickly someone will find

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
who will free you from the need to make difficult decisions,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
and will take them instead of you.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
It is quite possible that decisions made by others

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
will go against your personal and professional interests.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
The most detailed description of typical mistakes made by managers

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
is written in the book by Paul Natto.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Despite the fact that he mentions only three typical mistakes,

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
he gives a very good analysis,

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
which traps these three mistakes can be set in,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
gives a detailed description of these traps,

04:19.000 --> 04:28.000
and recommendations on how not to make mistakes and not to fall into traps.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
So, three mistakes that Paul Natto calls.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
1. Constant use of approach,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
which leads to failure,

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
and not the approach of the appropriate and best practice.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
2. The hasty decision to use valuable resources

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
before all the necessary facts are collected.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
3. Spending time and money to demonstrate that work is not done in vain.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
And further, revealing the topic,

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Paul says that three mistakes create seven traps

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
that trap those who make decisions,

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
and eventually lead to the adoption of ineffective decisions.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
Paul calls seven traps that can trap those who make decisions.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
The first is following the wrong instructions that do not agree with the facts.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Who can give these instructions?

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Either the person above, or the owner, and so on.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
The second is ignoring potential barriers to the path of decision-making.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
Also, the lack of clear goals that lead to uncertainty

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
and greatly reduce the work of the organization as a whole.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
It can also be a lack of desire to look for more effective ideas and approaches,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
in addition to those that are already used to,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
and in which it is very convenient and comfortable to work.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
The next trap is that the collection and analysis of information

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
takes place somewhat pre-emptively.

06:24.000 --> 06:33.000
That is, either only the data that supports one opinion is collected,

06:33.000 --> 06:45.000
or those that are convenient are analyzed from this collected information.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
This is very common, unfortunately, in the world of research,

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
in the world of preparation for a managerial decision.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
Sometimes it is done out of malicious intent,

07:04.000 --> 07:14.000
and sometimes, so to speak, so-called conscientiously deluded people can fall into this trap.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
The sixth trap is that in the process of preparation and decision-making,

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
there are many aspects related to ethical issues and problems.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Without thinking about it, managers can ignore this aspect,

07:36.000 --> 07:46.000
and thus decide to provoke unnecessary conflicts in the teams or more serious problems.

07:46.000 --> 07:57.000
And the seventh trap is that people ignore learning from their mistakes.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
And, in general, while maintaining their status quo,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
without recognizing the mistake,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
they try to do it again and again,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
the same way, stepping on the same rake.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
You have written in great detail about traps in the textbook.

08:24.000 --> 08:40.000
Now we will discuss only the recommendations that Paul Nat gives for the use of the best approaches

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
to make the most effective decisions.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
He says that you need to learn to use,

08:52.000 --> 09:04.000
to look for the best approaches at every stage of the process of making a managerial decision.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
That is, this is primarily preparation, within the framework of our course,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
this is preparation for making a decision.

09:14.000 --> 09:22.000
To do this, you need to carry out an intensive search for new ideas,

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
including using the methods that we discussed,

09:26.000 --> 09:37.000
which correspond to the desired goals and openly assess possible options.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
It is imperative to analyze the unrealistic, lost opportunities

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
in order to make decisions more effective and more qualitative in the future.

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
And it is very important not to give chances to those forces

09:59.000 --> 10:13.000
that can block your actions to make a decision at the stage of either its preparation or implementation.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
The second recommendation of Paul Nat,

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
which absolutely agrees with all theorists and practitioners,

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
is that you need to be focused on the problem.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
You do not need to implement the idea that came to mind first,

10:37.000 --> 10:45.000
accompanying it with intensive and large-scale efforts to manipulate the facts.

10:45.000 --> 10:54.000
That is, you do not need to create a visibility of the gigantic work being carried out,

10:55.000 --> 11:04.000
but, in fact, to carry out a lot of useless, unnecessary work.

11:06.000 --> 11:15.000
You need to use an approach that involves a thorough analysis of the collected information

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
and which will lead to the best results.

11:20.000 --> 11:31.000
And it is very important to plan enough time for the development of an effective solution

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
that is aimed at solving the problem.

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
Since, having made a decision in a hurry, without allocating time and other resources,

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
you can then pay a much higher price for eliminating the problems.

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
The third recommendation of Paul Nat says that you need to spend resources wisely.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
And the reason is as follows.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
You need to spend more time and money on making a decision at the beginning,

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
that is, at the stage of its preparation, and not on eliminating problems in the future.

12:20.000 --> 12:33.000
Provide resources for the search for better alternatives and coordination of different points of view.

12:34.000 --> 12:45.000
Make investments, that is, a certain kind of investments in financial and human resources,

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
in the analysis of the problem, in the search for all viable alternatives,

12:51.000 --> 12:59.000
and develop solutions that meet the needs of all interested parties.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
In addition to the textbook, of course, in which it is still said in short,

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
I highly recommend you to read Paul Nat's book

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
How to Avoid Traps and Errors Leading to Disaster.

13:21.000 --> 13:29.000
The book is written in English and is called Why Decisions Fail.

13:29.000 --> 13:38.000
The next author of the generalization of typical errors, or rather authors,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
is John Hammond, Ralph Kinney and Howard Raiff.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
They studied 8 psychological errors this time,

13:47.000 --> 13:56.000
in which managers or just people are most often caught when making decisions.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
These errors they called

14:01.000 --> 14:15.000
1. Egoism 2. Status quo 3. Attempt to justify the previous decision 4. Trap of the desired and real 5. Incorrect wording 6. Oversight 7. Memory permanence

14:16.000 --> 14:27.000
The trap of the desired and real makes it too important to give the original information.

14:27.000 --> 14:38.000
That is, we are kind of, they say, so, we are hooked on what we once heard or saw.

14:38.000 --> 14:51.000
This can be, this feature of human thinking, human, the work of the human brain

14:51.000 --> 15:00.000
can be used even to push you to the wrong decision,

15:00.000 --> 15:09.000
if there are forces in it interested and which pursue their hidden goals.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
The next trap is called the desire to maintain the status quo.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
That is, we all want everything to stay as it is.

15:22.000 --> 15:33.000
And this makes us stick to the current position of things, even if there is a better alternative choice.

15:33.000 --> 15:42.000
What are irreversible costs that push us to repeat past mistakes?

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
If we have already made a decision that was not very successful,

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
but at the same time certain resources were spent,

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
then a person purely psychologically strives to protect himself and his decision,

16:03.000 --> 16:14.000
tries again and again to act in the same way and prove that the situation, let's say, did not go as planned,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
but the decision was actually right, and so on.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
Very often we take what is desirable for what is real and start,

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
that is, we first form our opinion about how it should be,

16:29.000 --> 16:39.000
and then with the energy of decent and best application we begin to look for confirmation of this opinion.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
In this case, we very often fall into the trap that Paul Nath was talking about.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
We begin to selectively approach the selection of information,

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
in fact, rejecting all that information, those facts that contradict our opinion.

17:01.000 --> 17:14.000
Very often the leaders of the upper level fall into such a trap.

17:14.000 --> 17:23.000
The mistake of the wrong formulation of the problem is obviously a trap.

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
We have discussed it many times, and I think it is absolutely transparent for understanding.

17:31.000 --> 17:44.000
If the problem is initially formulated incorrectly, then the decision will essentially go along the wrong track,

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
and it is unlikely that the decision will be effective.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
The next trap is self-confidence.

17:52.000 --> 18:01.000
In fact, we overestimate our own abilities to predict and give an accurate assessment.

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
A person considers himself an expert, a person considers himself a connoisseur in this field,

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
and too much relies on his judgments.

18:14.000 --> 18:24.000
The other side and another trap is the desire to overestimate yourself.

18:24.000 --> 18:32.000
On the contrary, a person becomes overly careful when predicting unlikely events.

18:33.000 --> 18:45.000
This trap is very well connected with the ones we discussed with Matthew Snell and Paul Nath.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
There is another trap that John Hammond talks about.

18:52.000 --> 19:03.000
It is the constant of memory that makes us attach too much importance to the tragic events of the past.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
As a simple example, John Hammond and the authors give such an example.

19:10.000 --> 19:26.000
If you drive a car, you can say with 99% certainty that after a while you will drive much more carefully.

19:26.000 --> 19:51.000
The last set of mistakes I would like to talk about is the generalization of my experience and theoretical knowledge

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
that I have gained during my own work.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
These are mistakes related to the research.

20:02.000 --> 20:11.000
One way or another, they will be in conflict with what we have just discussed.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Nevertheless, let's list them.

20:15.000 --> 20:24.000
1. The purpose of the study is unclear or the true purpose is not brought to the knowledge of the performers.

20:24.000 --> 20:33.000
The first mistake related to scientific research is at the very beginning.

20:33.000 --> 20:51.000
The purpose of the study is unclear or the true purpose is not brought to the knowledge of the performers.

20:51.000 --> 21:04.000
In this case, it is very difficult for the performers to choose the right methodology and to collect relevant information.

21:04.000 --> 21:22.000
2. The problem is incorrectly formulated or incorrectly discussed.

21:22.000 --> 21:39.000
3. The next mistake is that the wrong strategy and methodology of conducting research are chosen, which does not allow to get reliable information.

21:39.000 --> 22:06.000
4. The next mistake is that the wrong strategy and methodology of conducting research are chosen, which does not allow to get reliable information.

22:06.000 --> 22:22.000
5. The collection of information is carried out for so long that the decision is lost in its essence.

22:22.000 --> 22:40.000
This can be a sign that a person does not want to make a decision, or that he just creates a visibility of conducting research, but in fact this does not happen.

22:40.000 --> 23:09.000
If the information is collected reliably, it does not mean that further mistakes are excluded.

23:09.000 --> 23:29.000
Without prejudice, the collected information can be analyzed, generalized and presented in the interests of individual persons or groups.

23:29.000 --> 23:58.000
Moreover, there are two possible situations. When the person who is collecting the information in advance knows the preferences of the problem owner, or he assumes that this will be well received by those who are provided with this information.

23:59.000 --> 24:15.000
In any case, this distorts the real picture of the situation and can lead to an ineffective decision and lead the person making the decision to delusion.

24:15.000 --> 24:35.000
6. The next mistake is that the collection of information is carried out in a very hasty way, time and resources are saved, which leads to superficial analysis and unreliable conclusions.

24:35.000 --> 24:45.000
The next mistake, which has already sounded in several other forms, is as follows.

24:45.000 --> 25:03.000
In this way, so much information is collected about the existence of the problem from the essence of the mechanism of the situation, including those that are not related to the solved problem, that you have to make many private decisions, and the main question may remain unanswered.

25:03.000 --> 25:32.000
7. The next mistake, which was also noted by Paul Natt, is that the research can be carried out without compliance with the norms of corporate and universal human ethics, which can lead to the violation of the rights of individual members of the collective and to the emergence of conflicts in this collective.

25:32.000 --> 25:53.000
Moreover, even the problem of putting or not putting research participants in the public knowledge of what is being studied is related to compliance with the norms of corporate and other ethics.

25:53.000 --> 26:04.000
We discussed this issue of ethics in great detail during the course of the method of research.

26:23.000 --> 26:50.000
The next mistake is a very common mistake that can be associated with the fact that a person, when describing to the head of the research team or in a dissertation,

26:50.000 --> 27:13.000
keeps something else in mind, and in fact, the conclusion of the work is based not only on what is available for the head of the report or head of the dissertation, but also on what a person had in his mind.

27:13.000 --> 27:42.000
In this case, the work may be recognized as ineffective, and the head of the research team, having read such a report, will be forced to ask a large number of additional questions to understand why this conclusion was obtained.

27:43.000 --> 27:57.000
Well, to conclude the discussion on mistakes, we will make several phrases of conclusions.

27:57.000 --> 28:18.000
The first one is that mistakes are not to be feared. On the one hand, you can protect yourself from mistakes and traps, and the best protection is knowledge.

28:19.000 --> 28:38.000
What we have discussed now, what you can read in addition, will allow you to learn to recognize these traps and avoid them, and, accordingly, will give you more confidence in making decisions.

28:38.000 --> 28:53.000
But at the same time, you need to learn to learn from your mistakes. After all, every unsuccessful attempt gives new knowledge and new information.

28:53.000 --> 29:19.000
If the decision was made based on well-chosen, analyzed information, that is, it was worked out, then nothing will prevent you from making an analysis of what was done in order to avoid it later.

29:20.000 --> 29:36.000
In the practice of business, in many successful companies, it is even customary to study mistakes.

29:36.000 --> 29:54.000
There, employees are not punished for their mistakes, because it allows you to find and determine the weak points in order to do your job better in the future.

29:54.000 --> 30:21.000
The next recommendation says that you need to openly admit your mistakes. You know, there is such a thing as a wish. If you laugh at yourself, others will not laugh at you anymore. Not interesting.

30:21.000 --> 30:43.000
Similarly, if you try to hide all the time that you made a mistake, sooner or later they will find out about it, they will talk behind your back, so it is better to openly admit your mistake and maybe even ask for advice on how to avoid it in the future.

30:44.000 --> 31:03.000
If you are a manager, then Robert Townsend says that you do not need to expose your colleague to mistakes and gives such a phrase as an example.

31:03.000 --> 31:26.000
If you slap your child every time he falls, he will never like to walk. Therefore, in order for your subordinates to conduct qualitative research, prepare effective solutions for you and make effective management decisions themselves,

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
they must be sure that they will not be fired for making a mistake.

31:35.000 --> 31:56.000
In conclusion, it can be said that you will get a guaranteed correctness of the management decision if you do not save time and other resources for preparing a management decision.

31:56.000 --> 32:08.000
If you will fix the main goals and tasks of the project, as well as the criteria in accordance with which the decision can be made or rejected.

32:08.000 --> 32:27.000
It is also important to be responsible for the collection and preparation of information for making a decision and to carry out a planned work with information, focusing on the planned results.

32:27.000 --> 32:48.000
It is also important to plan the work on the collection and analysis of information on the results and deadlines of the study, generalization, preparation of prototypes, and so on.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
That is, the work should be carried out in a planned manner.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
And the last thing we just discussed.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
The correctness of the management decision is guaranteed.

33:03.000 --> 33:20.000
Not 100%, of course, but nevertheless, if you learn to either avoid mistakes or traps or make correct conclusions from a failed experience.

33:21.000 --> 33:32.000
Thank you all for your attention. I wish you good luck in business and personal happiness.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
All the best!
