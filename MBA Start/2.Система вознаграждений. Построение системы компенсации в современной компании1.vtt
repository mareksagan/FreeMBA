00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.500
The next part of our program will be an analysis of what tools we have to stimulate labor,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.500
and there are not so many of them, and what combinations can be made of this, and what we get as a result.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.500
So, let's take a closer look at the tools that we, as managers, have in stock

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.500
in order to form a compensation plan that is attractive to our employees.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:42.500
A compensation plan is a house of cubes that our employee should like.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Our employees are different, so we will provide different compensation plans to different employees,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.500
in order to stimulate their behavior, which is required of these employees for our company.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.500
But there are relatively few cubes from which these plans are made.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Let's start with the fact that all these components of the compensation plan, all these cubes, can be divided into two categories.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.500
The first category is direct payments, that is, this is the money that our employees receive

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.500
as compensation for working at our enterprise, giving us their time, energy, strength, knowledge, and so on.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500
The second category is what is commonly called a social package.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.500
At first glance, the social package is not very related to stimulating labor.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:49.500
As a rule, it is not money, it is either a guarantee, or a compensation, or goods and services that the enterprise provides to its employees.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.500
Nevertheless, if we look at the most advanced and developed organizations, they have a large and rather complex social package.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.500
Let's take a separate look at the components of the social package and try to understand why it is needed and how to design it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
Let's start with direct payments.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.500
Direct payments are also divided into two parts.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:22.500
The first part is the permanent part, that is, what our employee receives every month, regardless of how he worked.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.500
The second part is the variable part, which is the part that the employee receives to a greater or lesser extent,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.500
in connection with a particular collective or individual result.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500
Let's start with the permanent part.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
At most enterprises, there is a thing called a positional package.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.500
To do this, a tariff grid is developed, that is, a table that shows which category of employees is subject to which package.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:01.500
As a rule, the tariff grid and its categories have a certain width, which is called a conditional fork.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.500
That is, within each category there is a minimum, a median, an average and a maximum part.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.500
We will look at how the tariff grid is formed separately.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500
The second part is personal add-ons.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.500
In the case when a given employee does not pay the tariff grid according to his merits and values for the organization,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500
we can offer him additional monetary rewards.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.500
For what? For the experience of working in our company.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.500
There are companies that add money to the old employees for remaining loyal to the enterprise.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.500
The more employees remain at the enterprise, the more these add-ons.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Maybe for special knowledge and qualifications.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.500
Let's imagine that our organization actively works with representatives of different countries,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.500
and we need managers who can communicate in Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, etc.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.500
We can pay people for mastering rare foreign languages.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.500
I will say only one thing about add-ons.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.500
This is a very useful thing, because it individualizes the attitude of the employer to the employee.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.500
It shows the employee his personal, individual value for the organization.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.500
But I do not recommend getting too involved in add-ons,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.500
because it often turns out that all the order in the labor payment,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.500
which we tried to establish with the help of the tariff grid and the construction of premium rewards,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500
is interrupted by a huge number of add-ons, which are purely individual,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.500
and as a result, the whole system loses its controllability, clarity and integrity.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.500
And finally, the constant part is the compensation for the worker's expenses.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500
What is it?

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.500
Imagine that we have several drivers on our personal cars.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.500
Of course, they spend money on the service, on technical inspection, on repair, on gasoline.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:17.500
These are the personal funds that a person, due to his position and role, invests in the work of our enterprise.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.500
Naturally, it would be fair if the enterprise compensated him for this money.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500
The variable part.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:32.500
The variable part includes two components, one of which is called premiums, and the other is called bonuses.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.500
These terms are often confused.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.500
I propose to define them this way.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.500
The premium is what is relatively small in relation to the deposit,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.500
well, the maximum is 100%, no more than the deposit.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.500
And it is paid often, at a certain period of time.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.500
It is paid either once a month or once a quarter.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500
What are bonuses?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:08.500
A bonus is a reward that is paid rarely, usually once a year, and it is large in relation to the deposit.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.500
For example, it can reach 10, 12 deposits.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:20.500
Bonuses are a significant expense for an enterprise due to their size.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.500
Therefore, it is not always advisable to pay them to all categories of workers.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.500
This system is not always effective.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.500
What categories of workers should be paid to, and why, we will find out in the third part of the course,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.500
when we will consider specific situations and cases.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.500
These are all the cubes from which we can draw up compensation plans.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.500
It seems that there are not so many of them, and the picture is quite simple.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.500
But this is only at first glance.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.500
Now we will consider these components of the compensation plan separately.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.500
We will try to understand the logic by which they are built, how they work,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.500
and what we need to do to make them all work effectively at our enterprise.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Each of the components of the compensation plan has its own purpose in the incentive system.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:20.500
Let's consider them separately and try to understand what we want to achieve from the worker

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.500
using each of these cubes or bricks that we have just discussed.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.500
The first one.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.500
The permanent part of the compensation plan, that is, the duty deposit,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.500
is aimed at providing the level of life that the worker would like to maintain.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.500
We remember that this is one of the most important factors in the worker's attitude to the incentive system.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.500
The second one.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.500
The permanent part provides the worker with loyalty,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.500
because he knows that he will receive it tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.500
and in the future, he will be given a promotion under good conditions.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:10.500
This is a feeling of confidence in the future and loyalty to our employee at the enterprise.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:18.500
And finally, the permanent part, due to its size, is our message to the worker,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.500
our signal to him that we highly appreciate his work.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.500
The high permanent part, high duty deposits,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.500
is a demonstration from the employer that the worker is appreciated by the organization.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.500
Again, we see a mix of moral and material factors of the incentive system.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.500
The variable part.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500
As we have already seen, the variable part includes two components,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.500
that is, bonuses and bonuses.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.500
The bonuses are primarily the incentives for short-term results.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.500
What do I mean by short-term?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.500
Since they are paid out quite often,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.500
this is a signal to the worker that he has done a good job.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500
But not only that.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500
If the worker has done a bad job,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.500
violated the rules,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.500
did not bring the results we expected from him,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.500
then we can reduce this bonus.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.500
And in this case, if we talk in the format of a wick and a gingerbread,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.500
then the bonus is not only a gingerbread,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.500
but also the possibility of using a wick, if you want.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.500
That is, if there is a high premium component in the compensation plan,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.500
it can be used as a punishment for the worker.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.500
That is, to deprive him.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.500
Bonuses.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.500
Bonuses provide several factors at once.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.500
First of all, it is a guarantee of loyalty,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.500
a guarantee of prospects,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.500
because if a person knows that at the end of the year he will receive a large amount,

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.500
then, accordingly, he will probably work this year

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500
and will not leave us.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.500
The second is the stimulation of long-term results,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.500
unlike the premium.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.500
There are a number of positions, especially top ones,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.500
where it is impossible to achieve results within a month or a quarter.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.500
The results are visible only at the level of the company as a whole,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.500
in the long term.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.500
And, accordingly, bonuses support this work for the long term.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.500
And finally, bonuses play the role of moral support,

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.500
of course, very strong,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.500
because it is a very powerful signal to organizations and workers

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
that they are valuable to them.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.500
I know organizations where workers say,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500
well, our salary is not very high,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.500
but we work mainly for bonuses.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.500
And finally, the social package.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.500
The social package solves several problems at once.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.500
First, it contributes to the level of support

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.500
of the level of life of the workers to which they are oriented.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.500
Second, it provides loyalty.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.500
And, on the other hand, it demonstrates to workers

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.500
that the organization is promising

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500
and is going to work further,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.500
and will not leave the market,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.500
and will not be kicked out of work.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.500
If the organization invests in the social package,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.500
it demonstrates its stability.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.500
Of course, the social package plays a significant moral role,

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.500
because it demonstrates the employer's work,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.500
the care for its employees.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.500
How does this happen?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.500
We will see a little later.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.500
Now I will say only one thing.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.500
An effective system of stimulation of labor

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.500
requires us to design our house,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.500
or a set of houses of different compensation plans,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.500
depending on what we are, first of all,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.500
and what categories of workers we expect.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.500
Providing them with the right standard of living,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.500
prospects, attachment to our organization,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.500
stimulating short-term results,

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500
or stimulating long-term results,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.500
and moral factors,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.500
that is, demonstrations to our workers,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.500
our mutual loyalty to them.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.500
There are several standard,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.500
widely known around the world,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.500
traditional compensation plans,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.500
which I would like to start with.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.500
The first thing to say in this regard is the question

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.500
of what we will put as the basis

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.500
of what we are going to pay the worker.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.500
There are two approaches.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.500
We will pay one worker their result.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.500
If it is a machine that produces parts,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.500
we want to pay him for a certain amount of parts,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.500
produced in a certain amount of time and without defects.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.500
If it is a sales manager,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.500
we want to pay him for how many clients he attracted,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.500
how much goods he let go,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.500
what amount, what is his turnover,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.500
that is, we pay according to the results.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.500
The second payment system is temporary.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.500
This means that we pay the worker

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.500
for the time spent at work,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.500
provided that he was not just sitting on a chair,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.500
but was doing something.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.500
There are also mixed forms of labor payment,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.500
which we will talk about in more detail.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.500
I want to say right away that we can pay

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.500
each worker separately,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.500
according to his results or his time,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.500
or we can use collective or brigade forms

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500
of labor payment,

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.500
when the result, time, or labor of the worker is paid,

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.500
and within it there is already a distribution of payment

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.500
among the workers.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.500
So let's start with the payment according to the results.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.500
It is called a collective payment,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.500
and there are quite a few options.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.500
The first is called a simple collective payment,

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.500
and in Russian it is called

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.500
as you dig, so you dig.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.500
This means that if I stand by the conveyor

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.500
and collect the devices,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.500
then from each device I have collected

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.500
and left my workplace further along the conveyor,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.500
I get a certain amount of money.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.500
How much is calculated separately

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.500
depends on the complexity of the work I do,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.500
the cost of this device,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.500
the risks, and a number of factors.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.500
Strictly speaking, this is a case

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.500
when I do not have a permanent part of the labor payment,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500
but there is how much I have done,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.500
or the same can be said about sales managers,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.500
we know that the system is quite widespread

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.500
when a person does not receive anything from the organization

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.500
except a percentage of sales,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500
expressed in some units.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.500
It seems that a simple collective payment

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.500
is simple, obvious, and very transparent.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.500
In fact, it has a number of disadvantages,

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.500
starting with the fact that it does not provide

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.500
social protection for the worker,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.500
it does not provide workers with confidence

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.500
in the future,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500
it does not show a positive attitude

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.500
to the worker from the enterprise,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.500
and besides, between us,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.500
a simple collective payment allows

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.500
a number of underground, under the carpet options

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.500
how it can be managed.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.500
For example, the valuation of the same work

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.500
can be raised or reduced.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.500
For example, a foreman who determines

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.500
how many workers did,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.500
can only describe a small number of workers.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.500
In short, it is not so simple,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.500
not so beautiful,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.500
not so transparent.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.500
Therefore, for the vast majority of enterprises,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.500
including sales,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.500
today they refuse this simple collective payment.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.500
I must add one more major drawback

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.500
of the collective payment.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500
As soon as the worker is offered

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
other valuations in another place,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.500
he also goes there with pleasure.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.500
There is a collective premium form of payment.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.500
This is when, in addition to the payment

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.500
for the output or the results,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500
bonuses are added for quality,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500
for speed,

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
for what we agreed with the worker.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.500
This is a more progressive form of labor payment,

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.500
because it really performs

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.500
a stimulating function for the worker.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.500
There is also a collective progressive form

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.500
of labor payment.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.500
What is it?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500
This form is used in cases

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.500
when we need to complete the work

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.500
as quickly as possible.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.500
We have an urgent order,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.500
and we need our workers to come out

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.500
in time, for which we will pay them separately,

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.500
and to cope with the production

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.500
of the above-mentioned product as quickly as possible.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.500
Or, let's assume that we have a warehouse

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.500
full of goods that need to be liquidated urgently.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.500
We can, of course, reduce the cost of goods,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.500
but this is not always profitable.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.500
Maybe it is more profitable for us

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.500
to pay our sellers

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.500
to work more intensively

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.500
and to invest in the specified period.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500
In this case, there is a collective

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.500
progressive form of labor payment,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.500
which means that my workers

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.500
get a big bonus if they cope

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.500
with the work within the period

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.500
we gave them.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.500
The next form of collective payment

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.500
is accord payment.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.500
What is accord?

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.500
It is when the payment is made

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.500
not based on the number of produced parts,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.500
not on the number of sold goods,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.500
but on the performance of a certain,

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.500
usually large, amount of work.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.500
In this context, accord payment

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.500
is often used in a brigade

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.500
or collective form,

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.500
when a team, a team or a team,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500
takes on the performance

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500
of a certain amount of work,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500
and as a result,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.500
they receive the amount of money

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.500
they agreed to pay to the employer.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.500
The simplest examples are

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.500
when you hire a brigade

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.500
to build a cottage.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.500
As a result of this work,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.500
you have to pay a certain amount of money

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.500
to the building.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500
It seems that this accord system

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.500
is old and primitive,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.500
and it is mainly related

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.500
to relatively simple types of labor.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.500
No, it is not.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.500
The same system is used

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.500
in the payment of project management.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.500
When a project is implemented,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500
no matter in what field,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.500
in the field of implementation,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500
in the field of development,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500
in the field of IT,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.500
in the field of design,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500
a temporary team is created,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.500
a team, as they say,

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500
and this team works

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.500
until the result is achieved,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.500
according to which

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.500
this accord payment is received.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.500
There is also a well-known

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.500
accord-premium system.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500
This is when we not only agree

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.500
to perform a certain amount of work,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.500
but also guarantee a higher premium

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.500
if, as in the case of a

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.500
production-progressive system,

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.500
the work is done on time,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.500
a short period of time,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500
as a rule,

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.500
and with high quality.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500
Temporary payment.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500
At first glance,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.500
it seems more primitive,

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.500
less stimulating than

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.500
the actual payment.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.500
But let's look at the

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.500
members of our employees,

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.500
their role and functions.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.500
We have employees who

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.500
clearly give a specific result,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.500
which can be calculated in rubles

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.500
or in other units.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.500
And there are employees whose

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.500
task is to ensure the process.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.500
The most striking

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.500
manifestation is accounting.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.500
They do not give results

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.500
but must perform their functions

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.500
accurately and on time.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.500
Or, in the structure of your HR

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.500
management, there is a recruiter,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.500
whose mission is to hire

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.500
employees and fill vacancies.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.500
We can calculate how many

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.500
employees he hired and what

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.500
terms they served.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.500
And next to him or in the next

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.500
room sits an inspector on duty,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.500
whose task is to provide

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500
the documents on time.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.500
So, temporary payment

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.500
is used for those categories

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.500
of employees for which it is

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.500
impossible or difficult to

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.500
calculate specific results.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.500
But it exists as a simple

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.500
temporariness.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.500
The most primitive case is

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.500
when we pay the employee

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.500
the same amount of hours

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.500
they have worked,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.500
in accordance with the tariff grid.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.500
It is clear that this form

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.500
does not stimulate the work too much,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.500
so there is a temporary payment

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500
form, when in addition to

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.500
payment for a certain amount

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.500
of hours worked, the employee

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.500
receives a bonus for quality,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.500
which can be reduced if

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.500
this quality does not meet

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.500
our requirements, or if

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.500
the employee commits some

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.500
violations of the discipline.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.500
Let's talk a little bit about

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.500
collective or brigand forms

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.500
of labor payment.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.500
We have already said that

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.500
the accordant and accordant-premium

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500
systems are collective,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.500
because quite rarely one person

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.500
can do a large amount of work.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.500
As a rule, it is a collective work.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.500
In terms of collective forms

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.500
of labor payment, I want to

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.500
touch on two points.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.500
As we said, we have employees

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.500
who must give us the result,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.500
and we pay for the result.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.500
There are employees who must

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.500
perform their functions, and we

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.500
pay for their performance at a certain time.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.500
And there are employees whose mission

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.500
is to organize the work of others.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.500
These are managers, these are managers.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.500
So we have to pay them for what?

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.500
That's right, we have already

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.500
mentioned this, for the collective result.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.500
How is labor payment distributed

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.500
within the collective?

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.500
We have agreed

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.500
that for a certain

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.500
time, let's say a month,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.500
we will implement a project

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.500
for our employer.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.500
Let it be a consulting project

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.500
for the implementation

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.500
of our employer's

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.500
effective labor payment system.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.500
Agreed? Great.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.500
And we have completed this work,

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.500
and who of us should receive

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.500
how much for it?

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.500
There is a thing called

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.500
the labor participation coefficient.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.500
This is a coefficient

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.500
that is assigned to each

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.500
of the members of our

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.500
respected labor collective

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500
at the very beginning

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.500
of the work or at the end of the work,

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500
and the rate of this worker

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.500
increases or decreases

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500
according to how much he did,

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.500
how much he invested,

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.500
how much he worked there,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
what was his role,

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.500
what was his mission.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.500
The labor participation coefficient

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.500
can be assigned in a very different way.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.500
In some cases, it is initially

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.500
negotiated in the contracts

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.500
with the members of our collective,

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.500
in other cases, as I said,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.500
by the total result, we estimate

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.500
the final labor participation coefficient.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500
There are very democratic situations

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.500
when this labor participation coefficient

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.500
is roughly assigned by the collective.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.500
There are absolutely dictatorial situations

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.500
when this labor participation coefficient

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500
is assigned by the leader.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.500
Each time it is done in a different way

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.500
depending on which form is more effective.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.500
These are the traditional

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.500
compensation plans.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.500
Of course, you have heard these words.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.500
There is nothing new here.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.500
And at the same time,

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.500
these plans can be used

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.500
for the assessment

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.500
and payment of labor

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.500
in quite simple cases

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.500
to very complex ones,

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.500
such as the formation

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.500
of the payment system

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.500
of the same project workers.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.500
Therefore, I highly recommend

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.500
not to forget about these simple

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.500
compensation plans.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.500
There are many situations

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.500
when the use of these traditional

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.500
and understandable systems

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.500
is not very effective.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.500
In general, you should not invent

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.500
anything else.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.500
In other cases,

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.500
it happens that you should.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.500
We will talk about

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.500
how this will happen.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500
One of the factors

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.500
that ensure the attractiveness

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.500
of the employer in the labor market

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.500
is the assurance of the worker

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.500
in the future

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.500
and a certain level of stability.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.500
Although in most cases

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.500
the payment of labor is somehow

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.500
tied to its results,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.500
now almost everywhere,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.500
with a rare exception,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.500
combined forms of labor payment

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.500
are used, which combine

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.500
temporary payment

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.500
with payment based on results.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.500
Therefore, it is especially important

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.500
for us to understand how this

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.500
constant component of labor payment

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.500
is formed, according to which

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.500
hourly payment is determined.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.500
Here we will have to remember

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.500
that the term

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.500
tariff grid

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.500
is a word

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.500
that is often used

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.500
in English.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.500
In English,

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.500
the word grid

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.500
has several meanings,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.500
including the category,

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.500
in this case the tariff.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.500
I prefer the Russian language

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.500
and in the future

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.500
I will use the word

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.500
tariff grid to denote this concept.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.500
We divide all the employees

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.500
of our enterprise,

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.500
all the positions of our enterprise

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.500
into a number of tariff categories

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.500
and within each category

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.500
we pay the employee

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.500
in time as much as is provided

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.500
in this category.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500
Then we multiply by the number

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.500
of working hours.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.500
What is the advantage of this scheme?

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.500
First, it ensures a certain

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.500
objectivity of labor assessment,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.500
because these categories of the tariff grid

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.500
are not assigned from the top,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.500
but are specially developed

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.500
to apply to the level

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.500
of complexity of the work,

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.500
what it requires from the employee

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.500
and how valuable this work

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.500
is for the enterprise.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.500
The second point,

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.500
if we remember the factors

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.500
of ensuring the efficiency of labor payment,

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.500
is transparency, controllability

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.500
and, what is very important,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500
clarity for the employees.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.500
The employee understands

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.500
what the tariff grid is,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.500
what the tariff category is,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.500
and what the conditions are.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.500
When the tariff grid is built

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.500
and we know

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.500
how many employees

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.500
will receive

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.500
and how much will be paid

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.500
in advance,

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.500
it is very easy to combine

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.500
with the analysis of the enterprise economy

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500
and we can always understand

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.500
how much of our labor payment

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.500
is paid by the employees

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.500
and we can understand

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.500
how effective it is.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500
As I said,

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.500
this system is not only transparent

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.500
for management,

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.500
it is clear for the employees

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.500
and provides them with a certain motivation

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.500
and creates a clear perspective

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.500
of career growth,

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.500
in any case, much better

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.500
than the traditional situation,

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.500
when employees receive their salary

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.500
in envelopes and no one knows

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.500
or suspects anything.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.500
It seems that this system

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.500
is quite rigid,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.500
but it is not so.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.500
It is flexible and adaptive

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.500
because the entire system of grids

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.500
can be moved up or down,

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.500
it changes and it is clear

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.500
how to change it.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.500
Therefore, it provides

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.500
a high level of adaptability

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.500
and adaptability

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.500
to the conditions of the labor market.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.500
Today we can have

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.500
one system, one tariff grid,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.500
and tomorrow we can change it

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.500
according to what is happening

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.500
in the labor market.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500
I will say more,

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.500
many enterprises move the tariff grid

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.500
as a compensation for inflation.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.500
Tariff grid is revised

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.500
every six months or every year

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.500
taking into account inflation.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.500
Such advantages

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.500
exist in this system.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.500
I will say right away

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.500
that the implementation of the tariff grid

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500
where it was not is a big job.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.500
We will learn how to do it

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.500
in the third part of our course.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.500
Now let's take a closer look

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.500
at what it is.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.500
Here is the grid.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.500
Please look at the graph

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.500
of the tariff grid

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.500
shown on the next slide.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.500
We have several parameters

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.500
that are important

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.500
to determine

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.500
the design of the tariff grid.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.500
The first one

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.500
is the number of tariff categories.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.500
How many should there be?

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.500
There are six of them in this picture.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.500
Maybe eight,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.500
maybe 16,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.500
but more than a few dozen

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.500
are rarely seen here.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500
The number of tariff categories

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.500
depends on the perspective

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.500
we want to create for our workers,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.500
how high the ladder

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.500
they can climb

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.500
and how many positions

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500
they can get.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.500
If the organization is large

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.500
and there are many different people

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.500
in different positions,

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.500
then the tariff grid

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.500
will probably have

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.500
more categories.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.500
If it is not so,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.500
if the number of workers

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.500
is small

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.500
and the number of functions

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.500
and positions is limited,

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.500
then the tariff grid

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.500
will probably be useless.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.500
The second question

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.500
is about the variables

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.500
such as the minimum wage

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.500
and the maximum wage.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.500
The minimum wage

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.500
corresponds to the lowest

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.500
category of the tariff grid,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.500
and the maximum

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.500
corresponds to the highest

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.500
category of the tariff grid.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.500
What else is important to us?

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.500
The width of the tariff category.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.500
How much does it fit?

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.500
How wide is this range?

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.500
Where does the tariff category

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.500
end and where does it begin?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.500
It would seem easy to calculate

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.500
if we know the minimum wage

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.500
and the maximum wage.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.500
We simply subtract the minimum

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.500
from the maximum,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.500
divide by the number of grades

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.500
and get the width.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500
The width of the tariff category

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500
shows a noticeable difference

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.500
in the increase in the wage.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.500
This means that the tariff categories

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.500
do not necessarily have

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.500
the same width.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.500
In most cases,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.500
the low tariff categories

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.500
will be smaller than the high

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.500
tariff categories,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500
simply because for workers

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.500
at high wages

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500
the percentage ratio requires

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.500
a greater increase

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.500
in the wage.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.500
This is a very important point,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.500
because in some cases

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.500
the tariff categories

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.500
do not intersect,

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.500
which means that

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.500
the higher the tariff category

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.500
begins where the lower

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.500
ends.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.500
The jump from one category to another

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.500
automatically means an increase

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500
in the wage.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.500
If the tariff categories intersect,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.500
it means that a person

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.500
in the lower category

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.500
can earn even more

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.500
than a person in the higher category.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.500
Why do these intersections occur?

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.500
These intersections are a very

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500
delicate management tool

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.500
that provides us

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.500
with a moral factor.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.500
In some cases,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.500
it turns out that

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.500
the workers who have been

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.500
working for us for a long time

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.500
and who are attached to us

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.500
are not able to

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.500
work for us anymore.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.500
They earn a certain level,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.500
but this level

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500
does not correspond to the level

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500
that new workers require.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500
We have to hire new workers

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.500
at a higher wage

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500
than the old ones.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500
Of course, this is unfair

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.500
on the one hand,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500
but on the other hand,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.500
it is simply unfair.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.500
And where do you go from the third side?

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.500
The labor market is changing.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.500
The labor market allows us

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.500
to manipulate the wage levels

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.500
so that the worker,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.500
being at the fifth level,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.500
earns more than at the sixth.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.500
Thus, the necessary degree

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.500
of justice is observed.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.500
This situation motivates

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.500
workers more

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
and does not encourage them

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.500
to take offense

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.500
and leave our enterprise.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.500
As we can see,

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.500
it would seem that

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.500
the labor market is changing,

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.500
but on the other hand,

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.500
there are many variables.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.500
When constructing a tariff grid,

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.500
all these variables,

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.500
both minimum and maximum wage,

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.500
number of shifts, median,

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.500
must be taken into account.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.500
The range for creativity

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.500
is very wide.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.500
There is a point of view

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500
that the enterprise

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.500
should be permeated

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.500
by the tariff grid from bottom to top.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.500
The enterprise should take into account

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.500
all the workers,

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500
where the lowest-class cleaner

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.500
is at the bottom,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500
and the director is at the top.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.500
I do not think this is right

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.500
because a number of enterprises

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.500
work as multifaceted enterprises.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.500
It is difficult to build

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.500
a single tariff grid for the holding

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.500
where several factories,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.500
logistics system,

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.500
trading house,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.500
managing company,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.500
are all working together.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.500
Should it be built?

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.500
I think it should not.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.500
It is necessary in cases

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.500
when there are many workers,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.500
when the range of positions

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.500
is wide enough,

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500
and it is necessary to sort it out

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.500
and figure out who and how much

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500
we are going to pay.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.500
If the range is not so wide

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.500
and the number of workers is not so large,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.500
we can limit ourselves

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.500
to more primitive labor payment systems,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.500
without having to go through

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500
such a complex project

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.500
as creating and introducing

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.500
a tariff grid.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.500
Let's look at the next table.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.500
Here is a so-called

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.500
matrix of grades

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.500
for a tariff grid

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.500
with 8 categories.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.500
Here is another

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.500
big advantage of a tariff grid,

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.500
namely the ability

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.500
to compare the results of labor,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.500
the value of the enterprise

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.500
and the level of labor payment

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.500
of representatives

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500
of various departments

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.500
who perform different work.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.500
As we can see from this grid,

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.500
let's say, the fourth category.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.500
In the sales department

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.500
we will have a manager

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.500
of sales,

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.500
in HR department

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.500
a manager of selection of personnel,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.500
in the finance department

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.500
an accountant.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.500
That is, there is an order

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.500
and we can look at the organization

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500
as a whole,

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.500
determine where we may have

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.500
shortcomings.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.500
In those cases,

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.500
when we observe sharp changes

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.500
in the labor market of a structural nature,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.500
that is, not general,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.500
but in relation to individual specializations,

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.500
education, profiles of specialists,

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.500
and there is a deficit

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.500
in the labor market,

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.500
we can move the tariff grid

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.500
in relation to those departments

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.500
where such specialists work.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.500
Let's say,

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.500
if there are necessary engineers

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.500
at our enterprise,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.500
and the number of such engineers

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.500
in the labor market is very limited,

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.500
in this case we can move

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.500
and change some of the grids

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.500
so that our offer

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.500
becomes more attractive for these workers.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.500
So, colleagues,

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.500
we have finished with the summary

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.500
of the permanent part of the labor payment

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500
and we will move on to the variable,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.500
that is, the premium part.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.500
In order to summarize the premium part,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.500
there are many ways,

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.500
coefficients,

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.500
regulations,

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.500
and we will definitely address this

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.500
in the third part of our course.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.500
But now I would like to talk

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.500
a little about the now widespread

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.500
and very good,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.500
effective,

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.500
working, clear and transparent system,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.500
which is called

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.500
the system of key indicators

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.500
or in English

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.500
the key productivity indicators.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.500
We discussed this system

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.500
in our course on personal assessment,

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.500
now we will return to it again.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.500
Let me remind you in a nutshell

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.500
what we are talking about.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.500
We have our organization as a whole,

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.500
a large organization,

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.500
our corporation,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.500
which has strategic plans.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.500
In order to understand

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.500
whether we have implemented

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.500
these plans or not,

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.500
we need a set of indicators,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.500
indicators that will be

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.500
clear and accountable,

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500
and we can say whether we have implemented

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500
them or not.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.500
In order to implement the plans of the corporation

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.500
as a whole,

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.500
each unit must perform

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.500
its functions.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.500
Based on the company's plans,

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.500
plans of its departments are built,

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.500
for which this system of key indicators

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.500
is also created.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.500
So, from top to bottom,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.500
each employee receives

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.500
his own key indicator,

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.500
which he must rely on.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.500
The payment of bonuses

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.500
depends on how

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.500
these indicators are implemented.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.500
If 100%, then the employee

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.500
will receive 100% of his bonus,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.500
if not, then most likely not.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.500
But if 150%, then maybe

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.500
150% of his bonus.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.500
The advantage of this system is

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.500
that each employee,

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.500
each unit knows

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.500
how much he will be rewarded,

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.500
even if the unit is functional

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.500
and does not work for the result,

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.500
but for the process.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.500
It would seem that there should be

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.500
only a temporary form of labor payment.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.500
This is not the case.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.500
For each unit, including the accounting,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.500
the office,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.500
and all other units

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.500
that work on the process,

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.500
you can enter 2, 3, 4, 5 indicators

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.500
that will clearly determine

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.500
how well they worked.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.500
The most primitive of them

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.500
is the number of errors.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.500
Whether they were allowed or not.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.500
The most important thing here

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.500
is that these indicators

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.500
are clearly and unambiguously written.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.500
What is the disadvantage of this system?

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500
It is very difficult to implement.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.500
When a corporation is large,

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.500
the implementation of such a system

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.500
requires several years,

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.500
huge costs,

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.500
and is not always justified.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.500
But I want to say that

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.500
if we do not create a system of KPIs

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.500
for the organization as a whole,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.500
we can introduce such KPIs

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.500
for individual units

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.500
and for individual positions.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.500
The advantage is that the employee

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.500
will understand what we will

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.500
fund him for,

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.500
and we will understand it very well.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.500
As for the employees whose tasks

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.500
are functional,

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.500
I want to give the following example,

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.500
which is very indicative

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.500
and historical.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.500
There is a legend

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.500
that the great and wise king Solomon

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.500
paid his regular doctor

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.500
only when he was healthy.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.500
But when he was ill,

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.500
he stopped paying.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.500
Guess what the doctor did

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.500
and what he would do

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.500
if he were paid exactly the opposite.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.500
In translation into our language,

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.500
this means that for the doctor

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.500
the key indicator of efficiency

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.500
was the health of his employer.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.500
Accordingly, if the PPI was not carried out,

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.500
the salary was not produced.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.500
We discussed in detail

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.500
the system of formation

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.500
of the permanent part

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.500
of the salary

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.500
and talked about the formation

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500
of the premium component.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.500
Now let's turn to the next component

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500
of the stimulation system,

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.500
which is called the social package.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:09.500
There are many legends,

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.000
many social myths

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.500
and many points of view.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.500
In particular,

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.500
there is a point of view

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.500
that if we pay a lot to people,

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.500
why should we provide

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.500
some social package?

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.500
This point of view existed

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.500
for a while,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.500
but then it disappeared.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.500
It turns out that not everything

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.500
that an organization needs

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.500
is in the state of people

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.500
at the expense of their labor.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.500
Let's talk about the purpose

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.500
of the social package.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.500
First, it is a positive

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.500
image of the employer.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.500
Or, as we said,

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.500
if the organization allows

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.500
the creation of a social package,

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.500
it means that it is stable,

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.500
has certain reserves,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.500
intends to work further,

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.500
and such an organization

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500
looks more reliable

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.500
as an employer.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.500
Second,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.500
by providing the employees

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.500
with a social package,

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.500
we show respect to them,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.500
we show that they are

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.500
important to us.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.500
When a person in an organization

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.500
that has a social package

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.500
comes home and shows

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.500
his family

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.500
what he gets from the organization

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.500
except for the labor payment,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.500
it usually works on his prestige,

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.500
raises his self-esteem,

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.500
and it is a positive image.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.500
I want to give you a strange example.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.500
Now, in most cases,

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.500
managers are hired

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.500
and asked if the social package

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.500
provides for the payment of mobile communication.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.500
It is quite strange.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.500
Can people with such a high

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.500
labor payment

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.500
not find money

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.500
for a mobile phone payment?

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.500
In fact, it is a purely moral factor.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.500
If we pay a person

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.500
for mobile communication,

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.500
we show that he is so important

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.500
that he should be in touch

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.500
and we are ready to pay for it.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.500
This is a demonstration

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.500
of his importance.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.500
I think that if we paid

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.500
for the payment of the canteen,

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.500
instead of the high-paid worker,

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.500
they would not be so happy.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.500
Or the payment of shirts.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.500
They would not be as happy

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.500
as the payment of a mobile phone.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.500
The next point

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.500
is the fact

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.500
that it is just

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.500
an increase in the ability

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.500
of our employees.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.500
The well-known

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.500
components of the social package

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
are medical insurance,

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.500
food,

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.500
and payment of travel.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.500
In some cases,

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.500
it is the delivery of employees

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.500
from the nearest metro station

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.500
to the office.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.500
We help people in this way,

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.500
but we also solve one problem.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.500
If a person is sick,

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.500
he needs to be treated.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.500
If he comes to work

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.500
by public transport,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.500
he will be nervous,

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.500
he will feel bad,

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.500
he will be late for work.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.500
And if he comes back,

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.500
he will complain about traffic jams.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.500
If a person gets to the office

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.500
by car, he will complain

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.500
about traffic jams.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.500
He will complain about it

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.500
and he will be nervous.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.500
Therefore, we provide

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.500
a higher level of

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.500
employability for our employees.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.500
The last point is

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.500
the solution of problems

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.500
that interfere with the work of our employees.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.500
We could give money to our employees,

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.500
but we will soon see an example

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.500
that shows

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.500
how much more effective

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.500
it is to solve the problems

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.500
of our employees

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.500
than to pay them.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.500
In such cases,

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.500
problems are not solved

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.500
with money.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.500
In such cases,

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.500
we should create a social package.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.500
We are kind and we want

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.500
to do good to our employees.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.500
It is very pleasant.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.500
Unfortunately, we are a commercial organization

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.500
and our task is to earn money.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.500
Therefore, it would be unprofitable

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.500
to invest money in nothing.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.500
Therefore, when we create

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.500
a social package for our organization,

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.500
we should take into account

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.500
the savings of expenses

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.500
that we would have incurred

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.500
if we did not have a social package.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.500
Secondly,

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.500
very often organizations

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.500
offer such goods and services

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.500
as a part of the social package

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.500
that the organization

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.500
can solve better

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.500
than the employee.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.500
I will give you an example.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.500
The organization offers

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.500
a bank guarantee

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.500
for the payment of loans.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.500
The organization cannot provide

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.500
such guarantees for itself.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.500
Or, let's say,

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.500
we sign a collective insurance contract

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.500
with an insurance company

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.500
for the life and medical insurance

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.500
of our employees.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.500
We would have done it

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.500
if each of our employees

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.500
signed such a contract.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.500
This would have cost

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.500
much more money.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.500
We would have bought

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.500
a social insurance service

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.500
for our employees.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.500
What else can we do?

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.500
The fact is that

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.500
the so-called

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.500
insurance culture of the population

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.500
is not well developed in our country.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.500
Our people do not like

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.500
to be insured,

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.500
unlike, for example,

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.500
Americans or Europeans

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.500
who know that they should be insured

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.500
because there are risks.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.500
If our organization

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.500
had a social insurance system

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.500
with a family budget,

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.500
our employees would have forgotten

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.500
about it.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.500
Our employees are insured.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.500
They are happy and we are satisfied.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.500
So, once again,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.500
there are two important factors.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.500
First, the cost savings.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.500
Second, the efficiency of our staff.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.500
Third, the ability of our organization

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.500
to solve problems better

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.500
than each employee individually.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.500
This is how you should design

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.500
a social insurance package.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.500
Let's look at how

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.500
this social insurance package

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.500
can be distributed in the company.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.500
There are four options.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.500
Option number one

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.500
is the most common

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.500
and common for all.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.500
All the employees

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.500
get the same set of goods

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.500
and services

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.500
as part of the social insurance package.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.500
Is it good?

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.500
Not really.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.500
On the one hand,

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.500
it shows the unity of all employees

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.500
and the equality of all employees

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.500
from the cleaning lady

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.500
to the deputy general director.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.500
But is it always justified?

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.500
Probably not.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.500
That's why there are

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.500
distribution principles.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.500
One of them is

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.500
hierarchy.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.500
The more important you are,

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.500
the more you get

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.500
as part of the social insurance package.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.500
This is not always justified

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.500
because this system

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.500
is not very democratic

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.500
and often makes the employees

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.500
envious of the social insurance package.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.500
This structure

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.500
is typical

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.500
for old organizations

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.500
where hierarchy and ranks

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.500
are more important than

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.500
the real contribution of employees.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.500
Another option is

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.500
the tariff grid.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.500
The higher the tariff grid,

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.500
the more you can get

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.500
as part of the social insurance package.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.500
This is a more effective

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.500
form of organization

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.500
because it emphasizes

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.500
not only your status

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.500
but also what you bring

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.500
and how much you are valued.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.500
The last principle is quite new.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.500
It was born in Japan

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.500
and is called the cafeteria principle.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.500
What is it?

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.500
Imagine that

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.500
the compensation of lunches

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.500
is paid by the employees

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.500
in the cafeteria,

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.500
the gasoline is paid

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.500
and the children

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.500
are paid

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.500
by the employees

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.500
in the summer.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.500
Here we have two employees

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.500
who work in the same position.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.500
They have the same rank

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.500
in the tariff grid

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.500
and the same hierarchy in the company.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.500
They are equally valuable

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.500
as individuals and carriers

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.500
but only for a moment.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.500
One of them lives

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.500
on the other side of the city

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.500
and has to drive all the way.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.500
The other one lives in the next building

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.500
and gets to work in 3 minutes.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.500
The first one has a stomach ulcer

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.500
so he does not eat at work

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.500
but brings food in a jar.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.500
The second one

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.500
eats in the cafeteria

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.500
and gets compensated for it.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.500
One of them is the father

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.500
of three children

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.500
and it is very important

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.500
that these children

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.500
will do their summer work.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.500
The other one is childless

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.500
and does not need it.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.500
The package is the same for everyone.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.500
What should we do?

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.500
The first thing we can do

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.500
is to provide each employee

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.500
with a set of social services

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.500
of his choice.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.500
But it will be an uncontrollable system

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.500
and we will stop understanding

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.500
who will get what

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.500
and who will not.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.500
We will not have a system

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.500
that will only distribute

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.500
social services to employees.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.500
That is why we use the cafeteria

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.500
which is the following.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.500
Please look at the next slide.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.500
On the left side of the slide

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.500
we have the options

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.500
that the company can provide

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.500
to the employee in the social package.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.500
I repeat, these are just examples.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.500
In fact, the range of these services

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.500
is extremely wide.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.500
We create several menus

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.500
each of which includes

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.500
four services from this package.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.500
As an employee, I can choose

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.500
the menu that I like the most.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.500
If I do not have a family,

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.500
I am young,

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.500
I drive a car,

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.500
I love using my mobile phone,

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.500
I have free time

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.500
and I like to do sports,

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.500
I will choose menu number one

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.500
where I will be paid for gasoline,

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.500
mobile connection, gym,

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.500
and insurance so that

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.500
I do not get hurt.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.500
If I get hurt, I will get compensation.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.500
Let us imagine that

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.500
in our company

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.500
a woman works

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.500
on the same rate as me,

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.500
a mother of two children,

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.500
unfortunately she has no husband,

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.500
she does not have enough money,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.500
so she will probably choose food,

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.500
she will probably choose delivery

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.500
to the office by bus from the subway

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.500
because she does not have a car,

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.500
she will definitely choose

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.500
to pay for her own vacation,

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.500
because it is difficult for her

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.500
to save enough money

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.500
and she will choose

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.500
a vacation for her children

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.500
because the children

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.500
need to be adjusted somewhere in the summer.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.500
This is how this

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.500
cafeteria principle works.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.500
It seems to me that today

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.500
it is probably one of the most effective.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.500
And now, dear colleagues,

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.500
I suggest you consider

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.500
a project that I encountered

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.500
in my work practice,

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.500
which very brightly and beautifully

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.500
demonstrates what a social package is

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.500
and what its mission is,

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.500
what its function is,

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.500
compared to direct payments

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.500
to our employees

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.500
as part of the labor stimulation system.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.500
In one of the large Russian cities

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.500
there is a reinforced concrete plant,

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.500
a GBI plant,

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.500
a reinforced concrete plant.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.500
It produces

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.500
construction from concrete,

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.500
which is then used by the same plant

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.500
to build buildings and structures.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.500
A significant part of the employees

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.500
of this enterprise are women.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.500
And now imagine

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.500
what happens in May.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.500
In May, a significant part of the workers

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.500
of our plant

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.500
come there,

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.500
they are put on the table

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.500
with a statement of leaving

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.500
and are removed for three months to the country house.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.500
Because each of them knows

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.500
what their children will do

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.500
while they are at work.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.500
And they have holidays.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.500
They are in the city.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.500
Who do they go with?

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.500
What do they do there?

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.500
Do they smoke, drink?

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.500
Of course, no mother can stand it.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.500
And if we also consider

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.500
that she grows potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers,

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.500
it turns out that

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.500
compensation is quite adequate.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.500
But this is the period

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.500
when the plant is most loaded

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.500
with orders.

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.500
So what do we have?

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.500
In the summer period,

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.500
the maximum load

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.500
and demand of labor resources.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.500
And in the same period,

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.500
a sharp drop in labor resources

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.500
of the employees of the enterprise

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.500
with further return or not.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.500
So what was done?

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.500
A summer camp for children

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.500
was organized at the base of the local foam institute.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.500
It was called

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.500
Children are our future.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.500
It provided the entire set,

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.500
including hiking,

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.500
theater performances,

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.500
excursions, sports competitions

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.500
and a mandatory short internship

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.500
at the enterprise with paid money

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.500
for this internship.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.500
This meant, look how your parents work.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.500
What happened as a result?

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.500
The current staff

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.500
at this plant

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.500
became negative.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.500
This means that no one wanted to leave.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.500
The gate was built in the interest of those who wanted to work there.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.500
That is, the problem was completely solved.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.500
The enterprise was booming

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.500
throughout the region,

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.500
became well-known,

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.500
the mayor came, shook hands,

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.500
television came.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.500
In short, it worked very well

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.500
for PR and advertising of this enterprise.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.500
And if we count what it cost?

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.500
I will not give you a lot of numbers,

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.500
I will tell you only one thing.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.500
The amount that was spent on this venture

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.500
was absolutely adequate

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.500
to increase the salary

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.500
of each employee

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.500
at the enterprise

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.500
by 50 rubles.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.500
Now tell me,

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.500
what do you think would happen

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.500
if we simply increased

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.500
the salary of each employee by 50 rubles?

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.500
How would this affect their behavior?

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.500
Would the employees leave

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.500
the enterprise in the summer?

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.500
I'm afraid that they would not be able to survive

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.500
150 rubles.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.500
And their problem was solved.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.500
This is what a social package is.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.500
We can save money

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.500
to help our employees

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.500
solve their problems.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.500
We have finished the second part of our lesson,

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.500
which was dedicated to the tools

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.500
for stimulating labor.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.500
In the third part,

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.500
we will discuss

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.500
how these tools

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.500
are introduced into the organization,

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.500
what we need to do

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.500
to create a good

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.500
and sustainable

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.500
organization.

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.500
And we will also discuss

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.500
how to create a good

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.500
and sustainable

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.500
organization,

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.500
what we need to do

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.500
to create a clear

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.500
and manageable

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.500
tariff grid,

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.500
and what compensation plans

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.500
we can design

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.500
to meet

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.500
the expectations of our employees

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.500
and solve the problem

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.500
of creating an effective

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.500
labor stimulation system.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.500
Dear colleagues,

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.500
we already know a lot

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.500
about how to create an effective system.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.500
We know what tools

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.500
we can use to create such a system.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.500
Let's now play a little

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.500
in an enterprise that wants

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.500
to introduce

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.500
such a system of labor payment

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.500
and stimulation

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.500
to solve two tasks we know well.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.500
To make the enterprise good

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.500
and the employees too.

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.500
Let's start with the fact

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.500
that we will divide all our employees

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.500
into five categories.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.500
We pay the lowest

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.500
to the highest.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.500
And we assign each category

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.500
a point with a step of 100.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.500
The lowest category

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.500
will have 100 points,

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.500
the next 200, 300, 400, 500.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.500
Let's say we know

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.500
how to do it.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.500
It's not that easy, but let's assume we know.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.500
And now we will build a curve

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.500
that you see on the slide

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.500
and which,

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.500
according to the principle of noticeable difference,

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.500
should have this shape.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.500
It's not a straight line,

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.500
it will be a curve.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.500
The slope will decrease

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.500
as the labor payment volume increases.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.500
So, the low labor payment category

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.500
will be flat,

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.500
and the high labor payment category

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.500
will be almost straight.

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.500
Almost vertical, sorry.

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.500
Now let's analyze

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.500
the real labor payment

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.500
of our employees.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.500
Let's say,

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.500
this is the real labor payment

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.500
of our employees

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.500
and let's compare it with this curve.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.500
The blue dots are the drawings.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.500
What should we pay attention to?

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.500
In general,

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.500
these points in the curve

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.500
are more or less approximated,

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.500
but in some cases

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.500
they are quite far from it.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.500
The structure of the labor payments

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.500
in our enterprise

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.500
is quite individual.

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.500
And the distribution,

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.500
the deviation from the theoretical curve

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.500
is quite large.

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.500
As a rule, it happens.

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.500
But our task,

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.500
if we want to make the system manageable,

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.500
if we want to bring it

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.500
to a set of understandable

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.500
and manageable parameters,

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.500
it's not enough for us.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.500
And we want to bring the system

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.500
to such a curve,

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.500
close to the ideal curve,

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.500
at least in the constant part

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.500
of the labor payment.

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.500
To do this,

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.500
we need to do grading,

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.500
that is, to build a tariff grid,

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.500
that is, to distribute all our employees

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.500
by certain ranks,

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.500
depending on the value

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.500
of the employee and his labor for the enterprise.

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.500
And after that,

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.500
we need to compare,

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.500
assign to each of these levels

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.500
a certain fork of deposits,

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.500
which we talked about.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.500
And after that,

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.500
we need to finish by attaching

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.500
to the system we built

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.500
an additional stimulation system

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.500
in the form of a social package,

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.500
additional payments, bonuses,

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.500
and so on.

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.500
It would seem that this is a very simple

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.500
three-step task.

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:51.500
In fact, it will take us a lot of time,

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.500
because in solving each of these steps,

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.500
in completing each of these steps,

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.500
there are quite a few degrees of freedom.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.500
And we still have to choose

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.500
which way to go,

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.500
because, as we have seen,

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.500
the range of options is quite wide,

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.500
from one case,

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.500
when a person receives only

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.500
a temporary payment and nothing else,

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.500
and this system works poorly,

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.500
to another case,

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.500
when he receives only a percentage

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.500
of the result of the work and nothing else,

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.500
and we see that this is also bad.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.500
But there are quite a few options

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.500
between them,

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.500
and which one we choose depends

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.500
on a number of factors.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.500
On our will,

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.500
on the quality of our work,

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.500
on our corporate personnel policy,

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.500
on the market sector in which we work,

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.500
and so on.

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.500
The first thing we need to do

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.500
in order to distribute positions

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.500
in our company

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.500
on a certain grid,

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.500
we need to make a description

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.500
and an assessment of these positions.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.500
What is included here?

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.500
For each position,

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.500
we must specify the following parameters.

00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.500
The first is the name of the position,

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.500
so that we can identify it.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500
The second is its purpose.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.500
Why is it needed in the organization?

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
What does a person do

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.500
in this position?

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.500
I must tell you right away

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.500
that the assessment sometimes shows

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
that some positions are absolutely unnecessary,

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500
and in vain they exist.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500
The third is the place

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.500
in the organizational structure

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.500
of this position,

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.500
to whom it is subordinate,

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.500
and what role it plays in the organizational diagram.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.500
This is a very important and useful process of analysis,

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.500
because it may turn out

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
that our position is suspended somewhere

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
and it is not very clear

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
to whom the employee who is on it is subordinate.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.500
Or maybe it is in the wrong place

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500
and it will have to be moved

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.500
to improve the efficiency of our enterprise.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.500
The next thing is

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.500
who and what positions

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.500
are subordinate

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500
to the positions we are considering.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500
I mean direct subordination,

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.500
which is conditioned

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500
by the organizational structure,

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.500
and functional subordination,

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.500
that is, indirect subordination.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.500
When an employee in this position

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.500
has the right to manage

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.500
in one way or another

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500
other people at our enterprise

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.500
who are not subordinate to him.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.500
For example,

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500
a sales department employee

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.500
can manage a warehouse worker

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.500
who releases the purchased

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.500
product to the buyer.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.500
The next thing

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500
that is extremely important

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.500
is the determination of key functions

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.500
and responsibilities.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
That is, in fact, the duty instruction

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
what this person should do at work.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.500
And there should not be many of these functions.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500
They should be clear,

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.500
but at the same time they should be very clear.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.500
In some cases,

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.500
it turns out that functions

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.500
that no one performs at the enterprise

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.500
are formed,

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.500
they should be performed.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.500
And this duplication should also be avoided.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.500
The next thing is the education

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.500
that is required

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500
to take this position.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500
Sometimes this education

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500
is very high.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500
Sometimes we overestimate them.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500
There are a number of cases

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500
when a person without a higher education

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500
can quite well cope

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500
with this position,

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
and we require that he

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500
must have completed the higher education.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.500
And what is very important

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.500
is the improvement of the qualification.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.500
As I said,

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500
we live in a world of constant changes,

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.500
and it is impossible to stand still.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.500
And for a number of positions

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500
a person must,

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500
a person needs to

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500
effectively fulfill his duties,

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
but quite often

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500
to pass a certain improvement of the qualification.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500
This is especially true of our accountants,

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500
because, as we know,

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500
our tax legislation and the law

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500
tend to change periodically.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.500
The required work experience.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.500
What work experience

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500
does a person need

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
to take this position?

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500
Accordingly, if it is a large one,

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500
then the position will weigh more.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.500
If it is insignificant,

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
then it will weigh less.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500
Description of knowledge, skills, competencies,

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500
paying attention to special

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.500
special skills and knowledge

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500
that are necessary

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500
for this position,

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500
and not at all.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.500
Another very important point

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500
is the question of responsibility.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500
What does responsibility mean?

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.500
What results

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500
can our organization have

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500
when an employee

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.500
takes the wrong decision

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.500
or behaves wrongly?

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500
What results does this person

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500
answer for?

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.500
These results can be organizational

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500
or financial.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.500
In a number of cases

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.500
for different levels of positions

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.500
the amount of financial resources

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500
that a person can allocate

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.500
without asking anyone

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.500
is determined.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.500
And above this amount

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.500
the person must turn to the higher management.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500
To determine the premium part,

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.500
we need to do a boil,

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500
as we have already said.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500
That is, 3-5 indicators

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500
that are key for this position

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.500
so that we can say

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.500
whether a person works effectively

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500
or not, or not at all.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.500
Agree that the procedure

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.500
is not easy, it takes a lot of time.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.500
The main question is where

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.500
we will get this information.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.500
Most often this information is collected

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.500
by the organization using special procedures

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.500
where the analysis of documents,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.500
monitoring of people at work,

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.500
as well as surveys are included.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500
Special survey sheets are created.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.500
There are already standardized sheets.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.500
In some cases,

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.500
they will have to be created by ourselves.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500
Nevertheless,

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.500
we collect the information

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.500
in a certain way and approve it

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.500
to the management.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.500
According to the description of positions,

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.500
we can weigh the positions,

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.500
that is, compare them

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500
and distribute them along the grid

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.500
that we have already mentioned

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.500
and which is our goal

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.500
in the implementation of this difficult work.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.500
How can we evaluate positions

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.500
after we have described them?

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.500
There are only three methods.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500
Classification,

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.500
Arranging

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.500
and Binary Factor Method.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.500
Classification is when

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
we set a certain grid in advance

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.500
and lay out the positions

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500
along this grid

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.500
according to the results

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.500
described by me.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.500
Arranging is when we take all the positions

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.500
in our organization

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.500
and distribute them, for example,

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.500
by the method of pair comparison.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500
Which position is more difficult, A or B?

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.500
Probably A.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.500
A, B or C?

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.500
C.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.500
Thus, we arrange all the positions

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500
from the lowest

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.500
in our system of grades

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.500
to the highest.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.500
You will agree that classification

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.500
and arranging seem to be quite simple methods,

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500
but this is not quite the case,

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500
because both

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.500
carry a lot of information noise,

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.500
contradictions in decision-making,

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.500
as well as subjectivism.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.500
To avoid all this,

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.500
the so-called binary factor method

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.500
has been developed.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.500
There are several of them.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.500
We will consider

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.500
this method

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.500
using the example of one of them,

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.500
which is the most common

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.500
and well-known in the world.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.500
I mean the system

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.500
proposed by the organization Hey! Group,

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.500
which is also called

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.500
Hey's method.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.500
So, binary factor method.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.500
What should be done for this?

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.500
First, we select

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.500
the factors

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500
that are important for the organization.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500
Moreover, for each of these factors

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500
we must determine their weight,

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.500
that is, how important

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.500
this factor is for the organization,

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.500
based on the total weight

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.500
of the factors, 100%.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
We will see how this is done a little later.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.500
Secondly, we describe the positions

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500
based on the example

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500
that you have just seen in the slide,

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
and we assess the weight

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.500
of each factor in this position.

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.500
On the one hand,

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500
the importance of the factor for the organization,

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500
and on the other hand,

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
the presence of this factor

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.500
at this workplace.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500
What does this mean?

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500
For example, such a factor

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500
as making independent decisions.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
For the organization as a whole,

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500
this may be a very important factor,

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500
or maybe not, because decisions

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.500
do not need to be made in particular.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500
It is arranged in such a way

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500
that the manager of the company

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.500
must make decisions

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
for the company,

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500
because the market is changing,

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500
the clients are different,

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.500
the conditions are different,

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.500
the situation is different.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500
And if this is a sales manager

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.500
who has to let go of the goods,

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500
the buyer who came

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.500
and asked for the goods,

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.500
well, probably the decisions

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.500
are not very good here,

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500
and therefore making independent decisions

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.500
is not very good.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.500
On the other hand,

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500
the importance of the factor for the organization

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500
and the weight of the factor in these positions

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500
gives us a total weight for each position,

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.500
according to which we determine

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500
its position on our grid.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500
Thus, we determine

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.500
the weight for each position

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.500
or grade for our organization.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.500
How many of them we lead

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.500
is, in general, a matter of our will

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.500
and understanding of the situation.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500
Not much is known about

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500
the number of positions,

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.500
but it is desirable not to be too few.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.500
And after that,

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.500
having broken

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500
our positions

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500
by grades,

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.500
we bind them

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500
to the tariff grid.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.500
That is, for each of the grades

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500
we determine the upper and lower

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.500
salary range, as well as the median,

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.500
or rather, the median,

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.500
from which the upper and lower range

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.500
of the level of labor payment

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
will be received.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500
This is a rather long, complex

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
and labor-intensive system.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500
Let's consider it

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500
using the example of the HE method,

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500
which I just mentioned.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
Here is the binary-factor method.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
What factors can be present here?

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
Let's assume

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.500
the degree of authority,

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500
the scale of actions,

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.500
or the turnover.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.500
What turnover

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.500
does the employee

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.500
have in terms of money?

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.500
One can do nothing,

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500
while the other can do a lot.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500
The degree of influence

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.500
on the company's overall results

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.500
is an important factor.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500
Technical and professional knowledge

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500
of employees is very important

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500
for one company,

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500
but not for the other.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500
Management skills.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.500
Serious, powerful management skills

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500
and competencies of a corresponding education

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500
are necessary for working in this company.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
The skills of the employees

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500
are important for some,

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.500
but not for others.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.500
The complexity of decision-making

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500
is important for one company,

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500
but not for the other.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.500
Thus, we get an assessment

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.500
of the importance of each factor

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500
for the company.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.500
How?

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500
We conduct a survey of the company's managers,

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500
sum up the results,

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500
analyze what has been achieved.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.500
It turns out that for different industries,

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500
for different sectors of the market,

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500
these weight factors

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500
can be quite different.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.500
Although there is a share of subjectivism here.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.500
But what can you do?

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500
Where is it not?

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.500
The H-group method

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500
or the H-method of the guide tables

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.500
includes what factors?

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500
There are only three groups of factors.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.500
These are knowledge and skills,

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500
solving problems at work,

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500
and responsibility.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500
Each of them has its own weight factor.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500
Knowledge and skills

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500
are the depth of knowledge,

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.500
how much a person should be a specialist,

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.500
the breadth of knowledge,

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.500
how versatile a person should be,

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500
and the level of communication,

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500
where, how, with whom,

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500
in what order,

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.500
to what extent of complexity

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500
the interaction is carried out.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500
The second is the problem solving.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.500
Freedom of thought.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.500
Problems are solved in a narrow range

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500
and nowhere else,

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500
but we have a lot of options.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500
The complexity of problems.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500
How many factors do problems require?

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500
How standard is it?

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500
Should we solve problems

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
whose solution is already known?

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.500
Or should we invent something new

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.500
that may not even exist in the world?

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500
The third is the level of responsibility.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500
What is responsibility?

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500
Freedom of action.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500
What freedom is provided for this person

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500
at his workplace?

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.500
Can he make decisions on his own

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.500
and act at his discretion?

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.500
Or should he agree

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500
with his boss every step?

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500
Or is his every step prescribed

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.500
and described in the system

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500
of duties?

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500
The second is the influence of activity

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.500
on the end result.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.500
There are jobs that are not very important

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500
for the company's end result,

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.500
and there are jobs that are of fundamental importance,

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.500
for example, the work of a financial

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.500
or commercial director,

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.500
and in some cases,

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.500
the manager, who can bet

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500
a very large amount of money on his company.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500
And also the scope of control.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.500
This is the field of control

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.500
over people, actions, situations,

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.500
and results that are provided

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
for this position.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500
This is a set of factors.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500
It is widely used all over the world.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500
It can serve as a basis

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.500
for your work.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500
But I repeat,

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500
this work is labor-intensive

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.500
and you should mainly resort to it

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.500
for the sake of your work.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.500
It is not possible to build a system

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.500
of grades and a corresponding

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.500
tariff grid with simpler methods.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.500
So, colleagues,

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.500
our review of building

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.500
an effective system of labor stimulation

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.500
I would like to finish

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500
with another very important mechanism

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500
that we have not yet touched on.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.500
This is the binding of labor results

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.500
to some of our plans,

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500
to what we want to get

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.500
from a person at his workplace.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.500
And here is where the standards

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500
play a very important role.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.500
Imagine that we want

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500
to sell more and more

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.500
from a manager,

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.500
which is one of the most difficult

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500
categories in terms of labor pay.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.500
In this case,

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.500
we will pay him more

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.500
for the better results,

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.500
but how long will this go on?

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500
In theory,

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.500
a person should work more

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500
to earn more

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500
and always strive for it.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500
In practice,

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500
this is not the case at all.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.500
A person reaches a certain saturation

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.500
and then he no longer strives

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.500
for increase in the result

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500
or pay for his labor.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.500
There is a ceiling.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.500
How to deal with this?

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.500
The only way that humanity knows

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500
is to assign specific indicators

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500
that a person should achieve.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.500
How can we promote a sales manager

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.500
if we want him to work

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500
in our organization

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
and not leave?

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500
That is, he should have a good

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.500
constant part of the labor pay

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.500
and a good award.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500
This award should be tied

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.500
to his results,

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500
not to any, but to the results

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500
we expect from him.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.500
This is what the standard is for.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.500
It shows us

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.500
what result we want

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
to get from this employee.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.500
In this case,

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500
it will be the same sales manager.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.500
We set certain indicators.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.500
How do we set it?

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.500
This is a question for our marketing

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500
and sales services.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500
Obviously, it should be not over the cloud,

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.500
but achievable.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.500
Otherwise, everyone will understand

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.500
that this is a kind of inflation

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.500
and no one will strive for these indicators.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.500
On the other hand,

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.500
it should be high enough

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500
and even high enough.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.500
That is, to get a job every time

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.500
And then the labor pay

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.500
is built in the following way.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.500
We calculate the indicator

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500
called the result.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
Look at the formula

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
in the frame. It is very simple.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
We take the actual result

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500
for example, in a month

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500
and divide it by the standard,

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.500
and then multiply it by 100%.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500
This means that if a person has not reached the standard,

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500
then, consequently,

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.500
his result will be lower than 100%.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
And if he has reached it,

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
then his result will be higher than 100%.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500
But if we set such standards

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.500
above which we can work,

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.500
then we probably do not set them

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.500
correctly.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.500
How is the salary calculated?

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.500
Based on the base,

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500
that is, the constant level of labor pay,

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500
according to the tariff grid.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500
We take the base part

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500
as a constant

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
and add to it

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
the base part multiplied by the result.

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.500
What does this mean?

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.500
For example,

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500
if our employee, our manager,

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500
in the base part

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.500
receives 10,000 rubles per month,

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.500
it means that he will receive

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.500
10,000 plus the bonus,

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500
which will be calculated as

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500
10,000 multiplied by its result.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500
For example,

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
if our employee

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.500
showed a result of 90%,

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500
then he will receive

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500
19,000 rubles.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.500
This is a clear transparent system

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500
that meets

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.500
most of the requirements

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500
for an effective system

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500
of labor pay.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500
Is it always so easy

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.500
and simple to apply?

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500
No. The fact is that in some cases

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.500
we want the employee to achieve

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.500
not one indicator,

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500
but several at the same time.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500
Moreover, these indicators

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500
can contradict each other.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
Let's give an example.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500
Imagine that we have a store

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.500
that sells complex household appliances,

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500
accessories, paper, pens.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500
On the one hand,

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500
it is an expensive product

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500
that is rarely bought in units,

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500
but is expensive,

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
and on the other hand

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
it is a cheap product

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500
that is often bought in small quantities.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500
What do you think

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.500
the company is making money on?

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.500
If you think that it is an expensive product,

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.500
you are wrong.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.500
A company that sells a lot of small products

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.500
is more likely to sell

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.500
a lot of expensive products.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500
Let's imagine

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500
that we have a cell phone store.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500
There are two stores next to each other.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500
One has a performance,

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500
that is, a return,

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500
a result, a turnover

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500
twice as much as the other.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
What's the matter?

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500
We start analyzing.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500
It turns out that in one store

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.500
a person comes,

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.500
buys a cell phone and leaves.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500
He buys a computer,

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.500
a screen cleaner,

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
and so on.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.500
And the person buys all this.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.500
It turns out that this is able

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.500
to increase the turnover

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.500
literally twice as much as the other.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.500
But how will our sales manager

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500
or sales consultant react to this?

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.500
His salary depends on

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.500
how much he has realized the product,

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.500
how much turnover he has.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.500
This means that he will usually

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.500
strive to sell a more expensive product.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.500
What does this lead to?

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.500
If a person comes to the store

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.500
for a refrigerator,

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.500
expensive camera,

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.500
expensive cell phone,

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.500
the sales manager will

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.500
help him.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.500
And if he came for a pack of paper,

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.500
a pen or a phone cord,

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500
no one will pay much attention to him.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500
Thus, the company

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.500
will lose customers.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.500
Let's assume that we want

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500
to build a system

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.500
of adequate promotion

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.500
of effective work of sales managers

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500
or sales consultants

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500
who sell both expensive

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500
and cheap products.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500
We want them to do both

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.500
equally effectively.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500
Then we apply

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.500
a multi-factor system of standards.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.500
In this case, there are two factors.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.500
The first is the turnover

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.500
that our sales manager

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.500
should show.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500
The second is the number of

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.500
sales salesmen.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.500
As we did last time,

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.500
we set a standard for each

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500
of these indicators.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500
In one case,

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.500
the table shows 100,000 turnover

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.500
and 200 salesmen.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.500
The fact that our salesman

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500
showed is

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.500
880 turnover

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.500
and 205 salesmen.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.500
In the first case,

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500
the result is

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.500
88%,

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500
and in the second case

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.500
it is 103%.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.500
We multiply both numbers

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.500
and get 91%.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.500
Thus, we can encourage

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.500
not only individual work

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.500
but also collective work.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500
For example, we can change

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.500
a sales manager

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.500
or a sales consultant.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.500
Then we can apply

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.500
an additional KTO

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.500
or distribute the share

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.500
of each of the results.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500
The KTO is very flexible

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.500
and allows to achieve

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.500
a lot of work stimulation.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.500
However, we should not

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.500
try to regulate

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500
every behavior of a person

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500
by introducing new standards.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.500
Two of the standards work well,

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500
three of them do not.

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500
When there are five or six of them,

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.500
they start to absorb each other

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500
because a person can achieve

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500
good results in one indicator,

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500
average in another

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500
and bad in the third one.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.500
In general, everything will be

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.500
approximately the same.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.500
Therefore, I do not recommend

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.500
multiplying the standards

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500
and coefficients without measuring.

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.500
Use 2-3 coefficients,

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.500
it will be enough.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.500
Dear colleagues,

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.500
we have come to the end of our course.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.500
I hope it was useful for you.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500
I hope you will be able

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500
to apply the knowledge

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.500
you have gained

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.500
as a result of this course.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.500
To practice,

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500
let's solve a few problems

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.500
or cases

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500
that you will find

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.500
at the end of your notebook.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500
This is a specific situation

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.500
for which you must

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500
take into account all the knowledge

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.500
you have gained,

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.500
develop compensation plans

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.500
and explain why you use

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.500
these options, not others.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.500
You can manipulate only 5 variables

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.500
that are the basic contribution,

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.500
bonuses, bonuses and social package.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.500
I ask you to finish

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.500
watching our video lecture

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.500
on this topic,

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.500
solve these cases on your own,

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.500
and then turn on the continuation

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.500
and see what solutions

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.500
can be applied here.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.500
I hope that your decisions

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.500
will be similar to those

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.500
that we offer.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:14.000
So, dear colleagues, I hope you have successfully solved the cases you have been offered.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:25.500
Now let's try to analyze our solutions, see what we were guided by in each of these cases, and what results we should get from this.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.500
So, our first case is a compensation plan, which we call the elite plan.

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.500
It is intended for VIP staff,

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500
that is, for the first-time employees.

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.500
The question is

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.500
what do we want from these first-time employees?

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
We want long-term results

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500
from them,

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.500
and if they do not give us such results,

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
we will probably get rid of them.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500
Do we want short-term results?

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500
Well, most likely

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500
a person who holds such a position

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.500
in the company,

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.500
who works for the company as a whole,

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.500
whose activities are visible

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500
at the company level as a whole,

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500
will get long-term results.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.500
If we start to promote him

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.500
every month,

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.500
it can be perceived

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.500
as an insult.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.500
In addition, our task

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.500
is to provide him with signs of respect

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.500
and freedom from solving

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
small household problems

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500
so that he can work

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
with full dedication.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.500
Therefore, the compensation plan

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500
we propose includes

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500
a very high salary,

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
which is the highest level of the tariff grid.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.500
It is obvious that the managers

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.500
of the company should get

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.500
the highest level,

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500
but now we need to adapt to the labor market.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500
This means that we should be in the middle

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.500
of the labor market,

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.500
but not below it,

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500
otherwise the people we need

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500
will hardly come to work.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.500
We do not use long-term results.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500
We do not use bonuses,

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.500
but they are very high,

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.500
and maybe even an option.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.500
Now it is being used more and more often.

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.500
That is, the employee is paid

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500
the money for the results

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.500
of the company's activities

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500
per year.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.500
In practice, the employee

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.500
becomes one of the co-owners,

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.500
one of the shareholders of the enterprise.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.500
But the social package

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.500
must be high, expensive,

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.500
and it must be individual.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.500
Individual means that it must help

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500
this employee in solving

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
his problems.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.500
What can be included here?

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500
For example, an apartment

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500
or a personal car with a driver,

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.500
which will ensure that our highly

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.500
expensive and important employee

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.500
does not come to work

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500
in a state of emergency

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500
in Moscow traffic jams,

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.500
but rather thinks about how to get to work

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.500
and how to start

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.500
and implement

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.500
his main work functions.

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.500
Something like this.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:56.500
What is the next compensation plan?

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.500
The next compensation plan,

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.500
we call it a manager's plan,

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.500
is a plan that is oriented

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.500
to the managers of the middle

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.500
or lower ranks.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.500
That is, people who lead

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.500
the department and are responsible

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.500
for specific areas of work,

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.500
primarily group.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.500
The positional contribution here

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.500
must be average in the market,

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.500
otherwise it will not work,

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.500
but it should not

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.500
exhaust the entire amount of reward.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.500
It should be approximately 60-70%

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.500
of the total reward of our employee.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.500
Prizes, yes, of course,

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.500
monthly or quarterly,

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.500
the rest 30-40%,

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.500
and according to the results of the department.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.500
They must certainly take into account

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.500
the result of the work of our employee

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.500
precisely in the department

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.500
as a manager,

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.500
that is, how he managed

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.500
his subordinates.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.500
Third, bonuses.

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.500
They can be,

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500
but not so big.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500
And it is very important,

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.500
they may not be,

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.500
everything can be limited by bonuses.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.500
But if we pay a bonus to such an employee,

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.500
we demonstrate to him

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.500
the importance of his personal work,

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.500
his department for the company as a whole.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.500
The social package.

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:12.500
This package is certainly necessary,

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.500
but there is no need

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.500
to adjust this package

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500
to the needs of this particular employee

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.500
as in the previous case.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.500
It can be a general social package

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.500
provided to everyone

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.500
equal to him in position,

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.500
probably according to the cafeteria system.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.500
The social package should be increased

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.500
as a result of the experience,

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.500
which increases the loyalty

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.500
of our organization's employees,

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.500
and according to the achieved results,

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.500
it can also affect

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.500
the growth of our employee.

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.500
The next compensation plan,

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.500
we call it a professional plan,

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.500
is a plan for qualified specialists,

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.500
first of all,

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.500
engineering specialists,

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500
who do not manage other people,

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.500
that is, they are not managers.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.500
Their task is,

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.500
first of all,

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500
to provide uninterrupted

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.500
functioning of equipment,

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500
mechanisms, inventions,

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.500
and all that concerns

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.500
the technical part of our enterprise,

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500
including, of course,

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.500
IT specialists.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.500
The salary should be,

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.500
again, medium in the market,

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500
not high,

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.500
and not low either,

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.500
and should be 70-80% of the reward.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500
The remaining 20-30%

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.500
of the reward

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.500
should be received,

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.500
of course, as a bonus,

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.500
every month,

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.500
but in this case,

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.500
it should be received in full

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.500
only if it fully fulfills

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.500
the obligations imposed on it.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.500
If it makes mistakes,

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.500
if there are errors,

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.500
if there are problems at the enterprise,

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.500
then we can reduce this bonus a little.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.500
I think that bonuses should not be used

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500
in this case,

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.500
except for certain private cases

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.500
where the work of the company

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.500
affects the results of the enterprise as a whole,

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500
for example, the technical director.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.500
The social package

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.500
is the same as managers have,

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.500
that is, it is common for the company,

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.500
probably, the best is the cafeteria system,

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500
and, again,

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.500
it should take into account

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.500
the work of our employee

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:28.500
at the enterprise and the result they have achieved.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.500
The next compensation plan

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.500
is called the Clerc,

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.500
and it is intended for the executive staff

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.500
of the infrastructure units

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500
and our office,

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.500
for secretaries,

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.500
for assistant managers,

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500
and so on, for the office staff.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.500
The salary here, too,

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
the ratio of the salary and bonus

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.500
should be the same

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.500
as in the previous case,

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.500
that is, 70-80% of the salary

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.500
will be the salary,

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500
and the rest of the bonus,

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.500
which we can also use

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.500
to encourage those

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.500
who work well

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.500
and punish those

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.500
who make mistakes,

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.500
and so on.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500
There is no need

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.500
for bonuses.

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.500
The social package,

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.500
yes, it should be,

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.500
it can work according to the principle of the cafeteria,

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.500
it may not work according to it.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:24.500
The minimum package,

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.500
which is usually the food,

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.500
the compensation of the transport fee,

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.500
well, maybe some other expenses,

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.500
and most of all,

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.500
it should be tied to the experience

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.500
of our employee,

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.500
if we want to secure

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.500
the employee for the enterprise.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.500
It is difficult to say

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.500
about the results,

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.500
probably not,

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.500
because employees of this category

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.500
rarely give specific results.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.500
Usually, they require,

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.500
as we have already said,

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.500
a certain amount of money.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500
The next option

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.500
of the compensation plan,

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.500
we will call it progressive,

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.500
is intended for sales managers

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.500
of various categories,

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.500
that is, those people who sell,

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.500
sell actively,

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.500
do not stand at the counter

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.500
and do not wait for the buyer to turn to them,

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.500
but look for the buyer,

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.500
consult him,

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500
and then make a purchase.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500
Here the situation will change dramatically.

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.500
The base salary should be

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500
relatively small

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.500
and be 30-50% of the reward.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.500
This is, so to speak,

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.500
for securing the employee for the enterprise

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.500
and supporting him in those situations

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.500
when, for one reason or another,

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.500
he did not trade too much.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500
The bonuses are large,

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.500
up to half,

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.500
and according to individual

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:50.500
or group results.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.500
The bonuses should,

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.500
unlike the previous case,

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.500
not be guaranteed

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.500
and be reduced if a person

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.500
has not achieved the results,

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.500
but vice versa,

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.500
not be guaranteed in any case,

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.500
but be increased

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.500
when our employees

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.500
achieve the appropriate results.

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.500
Please do not forget

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.500
about the system of planning

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.500
and the use of vouchers.

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.500
There are no bonuses,

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.500
but there are some sales managers

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.500
who make up half of the company's income.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.500
And finally,

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.500
the social package.

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.500
Yes, it is good,

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.500
useful, necessary,

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500
it helps, it supports,

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.500
but it is the same as in the previous categories,

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500
although, of course,

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.500
taking into account the achieved results.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.500
The next very simple

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.500
compensation plan,

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.500
we call it a business plan,

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.500
is for trading agents

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500
and individual workers.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.500
The basic contribution

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.500
is either not there at all

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.500
or it is minimal.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:56.500
The payment is almost free,

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.500
that is, a person receives a bonus

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.500
because he has earned it.

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.500
The bonus is the main part

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.500
of his income.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.500
Bonuses are not needed.

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:08.500
The social package is not necessary,

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.500
most likely not needed,

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:12.500
but I want to emphasize

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.500
a small detail.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.500
If a company wants to secure

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.500
these categories,

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.500
it is necessary to pay special attention.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.500
They should be supported morally,

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.500
they should be held competitions

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.500
for the best, they should be honored,

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.500
they should be shown their value

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.500
for the enterprise,

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.500
that the enterprise believes in them,

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.500
the enterprise hopes for them.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.500
Otherwise, without such a moral support,

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.500
as practice shows,

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:40.500
the loyalty to the enterprise

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.500
is sharply reduced by the employee.

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.500
The employee should get a percentage

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.500
of what he has done.

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.500
He needs respect.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.500
This is the final part

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.500
of our lesson.

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.500
I will summarize the lesson

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.500
and wish you all the best

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.500
in the field of our common

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.500
and difficult business

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.500
of managing the staff.

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.500
Thank you for your attention.
