00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
Now that we know how the point of purchase and expenditure is determined,

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
we can plan the assortment of products,

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
we can move on to planning the production of several types of products,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and we can also introduce a new concept.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
This concept is called the marginal profit.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
So, the use of the marginal profit to determine the point of purchase and expenditure.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
What is a marginal profit?

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
It is denoted by the letter CM.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
What does CM mean? Contribution Margin.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
So, the marginal profit is the amount left after subtracting all variable costs from the sales volume.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
S is sales.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
VC is variable costs.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
CM is contribution margin.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
This is the marginal profit.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
The marginal profit of the product line is the net contribution of the coverage of the constant costs and the profit.

01:26.000 --> 01:35.000
Accordingly, the profit is what remains after the payment of the constant costs and subtraction from the marginal profit.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
There are different concepts of the profit.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Let's look at this idea in more detail.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
What does the net contribution of the coverage of the constant costs and the profit mean?

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
According to this idea, we consider the constant costs,

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
what we called F and C, as an investment.

02:06.000 --> 02:15.000
We invest the constant costs in the beginning of the business, in the beginning of the production.

02:15.000 --> 02:26.000
After that, we expect that the investments will be paid off.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
How can they be paid off?

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
They can be paid off by the production and sales of the product.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
But each unit of the product requires us to spend additional costs on each unit,

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
which we will call variable costs or VC.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
Moreover, we will sell each unit at a certain price.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
Thus, the difference between the price of the sale and the variable costs

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
will be the small amount, which is called the marginal profit.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
The word marginal means the limit.

03:13.000 --> 03:24.000
We take one unit, and one unit gives us a certain contribution to the coverage of the constant costs.

03:24.000 --> 03:33.000
The more we produce, the more we see the coverage of the constant costs.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
We covered the constant costs.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
What's left?

03:40.000 --> 03:48.000
Everything we get after covering the constant costs is our profit.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
We see that the profit we get is different from the marginal profit.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
The marginal profit is one single unit,

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
which is the profit from the variable costs we get.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
But this profit is obtained before we include the analysis of the constant costs.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
The profit is what is left after paying the constant costs,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
covering, crossing the point of payback,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
and subtracting from the marginal profit,

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
which is made by the production and sales of each new unit of the product.

04:35.000 --> 04:45.000
The profit is obtained by the marginal profit,

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
the total marginal profit, if we count it for the entire produced product,

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
and from this total marginal profit we subtract the fixed costs,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
that is, the constant costs.

05:02.000 --> 05:15.000
The point of profitability can be expressed as the point where the marginal profit minus the total constant costs is zero.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Or the marginal profit equals the constant costs.

05:21.000 --> 05:31.000
The point of profitability in the international definition is denoted by the Latin letters B and I,

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
which means in English it sounds like a break-even point.

05:37.000 --> 05:49.000
That is, the marginal profit per unit, multiplied by the point of profitability in units,

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
that is, the so-called break-even contribution margin,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
multiplied by the break-even,

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
all this minus the constant costs is zero.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
From here we can find out what the point of profitability is.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
So, these will be the constant costs divided by the marginal profit per unit.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
So, we recall the concept we presented a few minutes ago.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
We first make investments, we consider the opening of a new business,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
the production of new products as an investment,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
that is, these are constant costs.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
But the production of each new unit of the product requires variable costs

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
and also requires the establishment of a certain sales price.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
The sales price minus the variable costs and there is a marginal profit,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
that is, the marginal profit from the production of each new unit.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
The marginal profit per unit.

07:01.000 --> 07:10.000
And the point of profitability per unit equals the constant costs

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
divided by the marginal profit per unit.

07:14.000 --> 07:27.000
Now we will look at an example where we consider a different number of units produced and sold.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
We operate with the same symbols that we studied.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
We will repeat them again.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
S is sales, this is income from sales.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
In this case, it is 900 rubles per unit.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
If we recall, we produce cast-iron stands.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Vc is the variable costs.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
They are subtracted and the variable costs are equal to 500 rubles per unit.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Cm is the marginal profit.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
It is equal to 400 rubles per unit.

08:05.000 --> 08:15.000
Cm is the result of subtraction of the variable costs from the income from sales.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
Next, we subtract the constant costs, that is, Fc.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
And after that, we can get the amount of profit or loss.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
The profit is denoted by the letter P, which means profit.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
Next, we consider three different options.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.000
In one option, we have 250 units produced and sold.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
In the other option, we have 500 units.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
In the third option, we have 750 units.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
If we recall, 500 is equal to the value of the point of purchase.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
That is, the income from sales will be 900 times 500.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
900 times 250 equals 225,000.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
Minus the variable costs, 500 rubles per unit.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
And at the same time, we have 250 units.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
500 times 250 equals 125,000 rubles.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
The marginal profit will be equal to 225,000 rubles minus 125,000 rubles.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
This is equal to 100,000 rubles, that is, 400 rubles per unit.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Next, we subtract the constant costs,

09:55.000 --> 10:03.000
which will not depend on how many units we produced and sold.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
And we see that when we produce 250 units,

10:09.000 --> 10:17.000
we get 100,000 minus 200,000 equals minus 100,000.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
100,000 in brackets means that this value is negative.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
This is a loss.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
We are still bearing a loss.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
Next, we increase the number of units produced and sold.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Now we have 500 units.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
If we remember, this was the point of purchase.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Again, we repeat the calculation.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
900 times 500 equals 450,000.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
The variable costs, 500 times 500 equals 250,000.

10:56.000 --> 11:05.000
The marginal profit is equal to 450,000 minus 250,000 equals 200,000.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Minus the constant costs, which do not depend on the number of units produced.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So, what do we get?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
We get zero.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
Zero means that the costs are covered, but the profit is not received.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
That is, everything we have produced,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
we have covered the costs,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
covered the initial investments

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
that we made in order to start our business.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
We go further.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
Now we have 750 units produced and sold.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
The income from the sale is equal to 900 rubles per unit,

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
multiplied by 750 units equals 675,000 rubles.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
Minus the variable costs, 500 rubles per unit of variable costs,

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
multiplied by 750 units equals 375,000.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Hence, we get the marginal profit.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
In units, this is 400 rubles per unit.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Thus, we either multiply 400 by 750,

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
or subtract 675 minus 375.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
In both cases, we get 300,000 rubles of marginal profit.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
Minus the constant costs.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
That is, 300,000 minus 200,000 equals 100,000 rubles.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
100,000 rubles of net profit that we get.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That is, we see the whole dynamics.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
We see the loss area up to 500,000.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
We see the point of occupancy, the point of non-profitability,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
when we covered all the constant costs, but nothing more.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
And we see the area in which we get the profit.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
Everything we produce above 500 units,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
we get the net profit.

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
Now we use this concept to calculate the point of non-profitability

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
in units of the metal product for the same society with limited responsibility.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Thus, the point of non-profitability, BE,

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
in units, is equal to FC, that is, constant costs,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
divided by CM, that is, contribution margin,

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
or marginal profit per unit.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
200,000 divided by 900 minus 500

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
equals 200,000 divided by 400 equals 500 units.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
Please note that we calculated the same number of units produced and sold

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
in order to cover all the constant costs,

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
but we did it in a slightly different way.

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
In previous examples, we divided the constant costs

14:21.000 --> 14:28.000
by the difference between the volume of sales and the variable costs.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
Now we operate directly with the value of the marginal profit.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
That is, we divide the constant costs by the marginal profit per unit.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
And we get 500 units, which is the point of occupancy.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
Now we calculate the point of non-profitability in rubles by multiplying

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
the value of the point of occupancy in units, that is, BE,

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
in units, by the price of the sale, that is, SP,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
selling price per unit.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
BE, that is, the point of occupancy in rubles,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
is equal to SP, that is, the price of the sale,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
selling price, SP, multiplied by BE,

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
that is, the break-even point, or the point of occupancy in units.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
This is equal to 900 rubles multiplied by 500 units

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
equals 450,000 rubles.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Now we calculate the point of non-profitability in rubles

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
by using the coefficient of marginal profit.

15:45.000 --> 15:54.000
So we divide the constant costs by the coefficient of marginal profit,

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
or contribution margin rate.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
R is the word rate.

16:02.000 --> 16:12.000
So we divide 200,000 by 0.444 equals 45,045.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
The contribution margin rate, from here we see,

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
is equal to the contribution margin, CM,

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
divided by SP, that is, the selling price.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
The contribution margin, divided by the selling price,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
is equal to 400 divided by 900.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
400 rubles, the contribution margin,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
is divided by the sale of one unit,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
by the price of the sale of one unit,

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
that is, it is equal to 444 after the comma, or 4 ninths.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
And if we divide the constant costs by this value,

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
we will get 45,045 rubles,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
the point of occupancy in rubles.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
Now we will move on to calculate the assortment of products

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
and use the aforementioned concepts,

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
that is, the contribution margin or the marginal profit,

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
in order to determine the distribution of the assortment of products.

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
That is, without the concept of contribution margin or marginal profit,

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
it would be very difficult for us to calculate the assortment of products

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
and determine the point of occupancy and costs for the assortment of products.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
Let's first define what the assortment of products is.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
This is the proportion of sales of units of each product

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
relative to the total sales of units of this organization.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
We modify the previous task,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
associated with the Metal Product Society.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Now it sells two types of plant stands.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
This is a field stand for plants and a table stand for plants.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
The company sells 500 stands,

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
300 of them are field stands, and 200 are table models.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
So, let's define the assortment of products.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
For each of the three sold field stands,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
two table models are sold.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Thus, the assortment of products is 3 to 2,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
or, out of 500 sold stands,

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
60%, that is, 300 divided by 500, are field models,

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
and 40%, 200 divided by 500, are table models.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
We will do this work in several steps.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
So, step 1.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Calculate the average marginal profit.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Multiply the marginal profit for each product

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
by its percentage share in the assortment of products.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
This is the table that does this calculation.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
What do we see here?

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
We see calculations for two types of stands,

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
a field stand and a table stand.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
The columns are called as follows.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
The retail price in rubles, SP,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
the variable costs, VC,

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
the marginal profit in rubles, CM,

19:53.000 --> 20:01.000
the percentage share and the average marginal profit, CM.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
For a field stand, 900 is the retail price,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
minus 500.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
The variable costs are equal to the marginal profit of 400.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
But we have established that since we have 3 to 2,

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
that is, we have 60% of the field stands

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
in the total volume of the assortments.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
That is, we must multiply the marginal profit

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
by 60%, which is the percentage share.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
That is, we must multiply the marginal profit

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
by 60%.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
We get 240 rubles,

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
which is the average marginal profit

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
that we got for the field stand.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Let's repeat the same calculations for the table stand.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
Now we see that the retail price of the table stand is 400.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
The variable costs are 200 per unit.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
The marginal profit, the marginal contribution

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
will be equal to 400 minus 200.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
This is 200.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Multiply by the percentage share.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
We remember that we have 3 field stands

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
that correspond to 2 table stands.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
We produce 3 field stands for 2 table stands.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Thus, we multiply 200 by 40%

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
and we get the average marginal profit

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
equal to 80.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Next, we add two quantities.

21:50.000 --> 21:58.000
240 plus 80 equals 320.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Now let's move on to the next step.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Step 2.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
Calculate the average point of non-profitability.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
To do this, we need to divide the total

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
constant costs into the average marginal profit.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
The average point of non-profitability

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
equals the total constant costs

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
divided into the average marginal profit.

22:33.000 --> 22:42.000
That is, 320,000 divided by 320.

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
320,000 divided by 320 equals 1,000.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Step 3.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
Calculate the point of non-profitability for each product.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
To do this, we need to multiply the average point of non-profitability

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
by the percentage share for each product.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
So, we produce 1,000 of them.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
We multiply 1,000 by the percentage share

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
equal to 60% for the field stand

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
and we get 600.

23:37.000 --> 23:45.000
Then we multiply 1,000 by the percentage share

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
for the table stand and we get 400.

23:51.000 --> 23:57.000
Now let's check whether we calculated the percentage share correctly.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
To check, we will determine the marginal profit for each product

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
and subtract the total constant costs.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
The marginal profit is equal to

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
the field stand 600 times 400.

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
600 times 400 equals 240,000 rubles.

24:23.000 --> 24:33.000
The field stand 400 times 200 equals 80,000 rubles.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
The total marginal profit is equal to 320,000 rubles.

24:40.000 --> 24:47.000
Minus the constant costs, we get the profit equal to zero.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Why?

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
Because our goal was to determine the amount

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
that we should produce and sell in order to reach the point of non-profitability.

25:01.000 --> 25:11.000
This means that the amount produced above 600 field and 400 table stands

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
will be a net profit.

25:32.000 --> 25:41.000
Now that we have determined the amount and the quantity of products we should produce,

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
we will think about how to set prices for these units.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
The price is very important in order to sell the product.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
We should remember the laws of economics,

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
that there is a ratio of prices and demand.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
We know that the higher the price for a product,

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
the lower the demand under equal conditions.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
And vice versa.

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
The lower the price, the higher the demand under equal conditions.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
In this case, increasing the price will lead to a decrease in the amount of the product

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
while maintaining the level of non-profitability.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
In this particular case,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
when conducting this marketing study,

26:37.000 --> 26:44.000
the price increase effect is set to 100 rubles for the company's operating profit.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Since the competitors sell the same product at a lower price,

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
the amount of the product will decrease by 15% if the price increases by 100 rubles.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
So, we decided to increase the price by 100 rubles

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
and we see that the amount of the product will decrease by 15%.

27:05.000 --> 27:14.000
Now we should consider what will happen to our equations if we change the price ratio.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
We should determine how this decision will affect the operating profit.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
We see the table in which we make this calculation.

27:27.000 --> 27:34.000
So, for one product, we will have 1,000 income from sales.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
For 510 products, we will have 510,000 income.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Minus the variable costs,

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
that is, 500 variable costs.

27:50.000 --> 27:59.000
500 multiplied by 510 will be equal to 255,000 rubles.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Let's recall what 510,000 rubles is.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
We had 600,000 rubles.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
But as we have just decided,

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
if we decrease the price by 15%

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
since we increased the price by 100 rubles,

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
that is, the price has become 1,000 rubles per product from 900 rubles,

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
then we should have 600 minus 15%

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
and it will be 510,000 rubles.

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
So, the marginal profit will be 1,000 per product minus 500 variable costs.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
500 rubles in variable costs.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
What do we get? 500 rubles.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Multiply by 510.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
It is 255,000 rubles.

28:53.000 --> 29:02.000
Or we can subtract 255,000 rubles of variable costs from sales income.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
That is, from 510,000 rubles.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Next.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
The constant costs are 200,000 rubles.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
They do not depend on whether we increased or decreased the price.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
They also do not depend on how many products we produced.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
That is, whether we had 600 products initially

29:25.000 --> 29:32.000
or 510 products, as in this case, when we decrease the volume of production by 15%.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
We will get the same 200,000 products.

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
255,000 rubles of marginal profit minus constant costs, 200,000 products.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
We get an operating profit of 55,000 rubles.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
Let's compare the operating profit before and now.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
We see that the operating profit has increased.

30:01.000 --> 30:09.000
Despite the fact that we started producing less, the profit has increased by 15,000.

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
The decrease in sales by 90 units, that is, 15% multiplied by 600,

30:17.000 --> 30:23.000
reduces the variable costs by 45,000 rubles.

30:23.000 --> 30:30.000
Now let's see how this alternative affects the operating profit.

30:30.000 --> 30:39.000
Increasing the marginal profit is a consequence of increasing the sales price.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
That is, we have 100 rubles of additional sales price,

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
multiplied by the smaller number of units sold,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
that is, not 600, but 510,

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
more than 100 rubles, but 510 units, so 51,000.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
Decreasing the marginal profit from decreasing the sales volume

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
is 400 rubles of marginal investment per unit,

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
multiplied by 90 units less than the sales price,

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
that is, minus 36,000.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
Please note that when we conduct this analysis,

31:28.000 --> 31:37.000
we must fix one factor and count the changes only according to another factor.

31:37.000 --> 31:46.000
In the first case, we count only the change in the price, that is, 100 rubles,

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
and the number of units is fixed, 510.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
In the second case, in the second component of this calculation,

31:59.000 --> 32:08.000
we fix the marginal investment and see how much we have changed the number of units sold.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
90 is 600 minus 510.

32:13.000 --> 32:21.000
The calculation is based on the fact that we fix the first factor and count the second one.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
Then we fix the second factor and count the first one.

32:26.000 --> 32:35.000
Thus, we can calculate the marginal profit by adding the changes by two factors.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
The first factor is the increase in the price,

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
and the second is the decrease in the sales volume.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
In order to calculate the changes for each of them,

32:45.000 --> 32:53.000
we must apply it to the second factor, which does not change.

32:56.000 --> 33:03.000
Now let's see what happens if we, on the contrary, reduce the price per unit.

33:04.000 --> 33:11.000
We will set the effect of reducing the price by 100 rubles on the company's operating profit

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
while maintaining the same level of profitability.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
Since the competitors sell the same product at a higher price,

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
the sales volume will increase by 15%,

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
that is, we will win over the competitors if the price is reduced by 100 rubles.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
Now we must think whether it is profitable for us or not.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
How will this decision affect the operating profit?

33:38.000 --> 33:45.000
So, per unit we have not 900 rubles, but only 800 rubles, 100 rubles less.

33:45.000 --> 33:52.000
But we do not have 600 units sold, but 690,

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
that is, 552 thousand will be the income from sales.

33:58.000 --> 34:05.000
The variable costs of 500 rubles per unit will be 345 thousand.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
800 minus 500 will be the marginal profit,

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
that is, 300 rubles is the marginal profit per unit.

34:14.000 --> 34:21.000
Then we multiply 300 rubles by 690 units, which gives us 207 thousand rubles.

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
Or we can subtract 345 thousand rubles from 552 thousand

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
and get the same 207 thousand rubles of marginal profit.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
Next, the constant costs.

34:40.000 --> 34:48.000
207 minus 200 thousand constant costs will be 7 thousand of operating profit.

34:48.000 --> 34:56.000
This gives us a reduction of operating profit by 33 thousand rubles.

34:58.000 --> 35:05.000
That is, increasing sales by 90 units increases the variable costs by 45 thousand units.

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
How does this work? How will the decision affect the operating profit?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
The analysis of the changes.

35:13.000 --> 35:22.000
The reduction of the marginal profit consists of a reduction of the sales price of 100 rubles per 690 units.

35:22.000 --> 35:33.000
That is, we fix the number of units, 690, and the price is 100 units, 100 rubles.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
100 rubles multiplied by 690 turns out to be 69 thousand.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
The increase in the marginal profit from the increase in the sales volume.

35:44.000 --> 35:57.000
That is, now we multiply 400 rubles of marginal investment by 90 more sold units and get 36 thousand.

35:58.000 --> 36:13.000
But since we lose 69 thousand, the increase in the profit from the volume of sales does not cover the reduction of the sales price per unit.

36:13.000 --> 36:23.000
Thus, we see a reduction of operating profit per unit and a reduction of operating profit per total amount.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
The cost of the system

36:39.000 --> 36:48.000
Now let's move on to the concept of standard costs and draw up the system of standard costs.

36:49.000 --> 36:57.000
Here we will try to give examples of three elements of the cost of a product.

36:58.000 --> 37:06.000
That is, we go from simple division of costs into constant variables to the elements of the cost of a product.

37:06.000 --> 37:15.000
Next, we will calculate the cost of a product unit and show its application using the example of the standard cost system.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
The cost of a product has three elements.

37:18.000 --> 37:29.000
These are direct costs of materials, direct costs of labor and production overhead costs, which are also known as indirect costs.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
What are direct material costs?

37:33.000 --> 37:46.000
Direct material costs are the costs of materials used in the production of a product, which can be conveniently and economically traced to certain units of the product.

37:46.000 --> 37:58.000
Examples. Iron ore used in the production of steel, sheet metal used in the creation of cars, sugar used in the production of sweets.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
All these are direct material costs.

38:02.000 --> 38:09.000
The more steel we produce, the more iron ore we require.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
The same is true for cars.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
We require more sheet metal.

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
We can also attribute these direct costs to each unit of the product.

38:23.000 --> 38:33.000
For example, each new candy requires a certain amount of sugar that is put in this candy.

38:35.000 --> 38:47.000
Direct labor costs are the costs of labor, with which a product should be made and which can be conveniently and economically traced to certain units of the product.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
An example.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
The salary of the operators of the machines and workers of the pipeline.

38:53.000 --> 39:09.000
That is, every worker who makes a product spends labor, and the costs of his labor can be traced to each specific unit of this product.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
Next, we will talk about production overhead costs.

39:14.000 --> 39:25.000
Production overhead costs are related to production costs, which cannot be conveniently and economically traced to certain units of the product.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
They are also called factory overhead costs or indirect production costs.

39:33.000 --> 39:41.000
They include indirect material costs, nails, rivets, lubricants and small tools.

39:42.000 --> 39:53.000
Indirect labor costs, labor for the maintenance of the machine and the inspection, design of projects, and the observation and processing of materials.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
There are also other indirect production overhead costs.

39:59.000 --> 40:12.000
These are construction material and technical support, taxes, insurance, amortization of the plant and equipment, rent, utility payments, and much more.

40:13.000 --> 40:27.000
Production overhead costs are indirect costs distributed by the cost of the product, by the traditional or functional cost analysis method.

40:28.000 --> 40:35.000
This method is also known as ABC, Activity Based Costing.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
But in Russia it is called functional cost analysis.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
So, how is the cost of a product calculated?

40:46.000 --> 41:00.000
The cost of a product is calculated by the cost of production of one unit of the product, including direct material costs, direct labor costs, and production overhead costs.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
These costs are accumulated as the product batch is produced.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
They are calculated in one of two ways when the batch is finished.

41:11.000 --> 41:18.000
They are calculated by dividing the total accumulated costs into the total number of units produced.

41:19.000 --> 41:28.000
They are calculated by determining the cost per unit for each element of the product and by summing up the costs per unit.

41:28.000 --> 41:39.000
The information on the cost per unit helps managers to set prices for products and calculate the total margin and net income.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
The total margin is also called the total profit.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
The cost per unit of a product can be calculated using the following methods.

41:50.000 --> 42:05.000
The cost per unit is calculated by the actual costs, the cost per unit is calculated by the actual direct and indirect costs, and the cost per unit is calculated by the standard costs.

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
So, the method of calculating the cost per unit is based on the standard costs.

42:13.000 --> 42:26.000
The cost per unit is calculated by the standard costs of direct materials, direct labor, and production overhead costs.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
What is the difference between standard and standard?

42:32.000 --> 42:48.000
In Russian, the word is used to describe standard costs, but in English, the word standard is translated as standard, which can be described as standard.

42:49.000 --> 42:59.000
This method is useful when it is desirable to have information on the cost of a product before the accounting period begins.

43:00.000 --> 43:09.000
The following goals are to control the costs for operational activities and price education for the offered product for the consumer.

43:09.000 --> 43:17.000
The illustration of the method of calculating the cost per unit is based on the standard costs.

43:18.000 --> 43:29.000
So, we have a chocolate company that places an order for the production of 2,000 chocolate bars for a new customer.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
The accounting manager of the company estimated the following costs.

43:36.000 --> 43:55.000
Direct materials, 2 rubles per piece, direct labor costs, 1.5 rubles per piece, production overhead costs, which are spent using the reference estimate of 60% of direct labor costs.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
Let's calculate the cost per unit of the product for the order.

44:01.000 --> 44:13.000
The reference estimate of production overhead costs is 90 kopecks per piece or 0.9 rubles per piece.

44:13.000 --> 44:34.000
This is equal to 1.5 times the direct labor costs, which are 60%, because the condition says that 60% of direct labor costs.

44:35.000 --> 44:44.000
Direct labor costs are called DL, which means direct labor.

44:46.000 --> 44:53.000
Direct materials are called DM, that is, direct materials.

44:53.000 --> 45:11.000
The reference estimate of production overhead costs is 1.5 times the direct labor costs, which are 60%.

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
1.5 times 60% is equal to 90 kopecks or 0.9 rubles.

45:20.000 --> 45:43.000
Now we can add all three types of labor costs, 2, 1.5, 0.9, and we see that the cost of one chocolate bar will be 4.4 rubles, that is, 4 rubles and 40 kopecks.

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
Now we move on to the last issue of our discussion today.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
These are the theoretical foundations of the Direct Cost system.

46:12.000 --> 46:19.000
Direct costs are costs that can be conveniently and economically traced to the object of value.

46:20.000 --> 46:34.000
For example, the cost of the flight to the air fleet, direct costs, crew salary, time spent and hourly salary are shown in the table of work time and payment notice.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Fuel costs.

46:37.000 --> 46:48.000
Thus, we can say how many direct costs will be used for one flight to the air fleet.

46:48.000 --> 46:56.000
We have already discussed this issue today, so here is a repetition of the material already discussed.

46:57.000 --> 47:06.000
But we use this method to evaluate the work of the profit center.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
What is a profit center?

47:10.000 --> 47:30.000
In order to enhance and increase the efficiency of the work of production units in business that do not work directly on the market, three types of centers of responsibility are used, one of which is the profit center.

47:31.000 --> 47:44.000
There is a cost center, there is a profit center, and there is also an investment center.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
What is the difference between these three centers of responsibility?

47:52.000 --> 48:02.000
The cost center is based on the accumulation of costs for this center.

48:03.000 --> 48:17.000
It records how much is allowed for the work of this center, for the work of a business limited by the framework of this center.

48:17.000 --> 48:25.000
This can be a business segment, a division, a separate production plant.

48:26.000 --> 48:39.000
Since it does not work directly on the sale of finished products and on the trade, we cannot say how much it costs in market prices.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
We can only control its costs.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
Thus, this center has only a budget, but it does not have a profit.

48:49.000 --> 48:58.000
Unlike the profit center, since it really works on the final consumer, it sells its products.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
Therefore, it is called a profit center.

49:03.000 --> 49:10.000
Its work is evaluated by comparing the results of the actual profit report with the planned profit report.

49:11.000 --> 49:20.000
Accordingly, we can apply the direct costs method to evaluate the work of this profit center.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
This is the direct costs method.

49:26.000 --> 49:37.000
This is a method of preparing a report on the work of a profit center that classifies the managed costs of the manager as direct or permanent.

49:38.000 --> 49:45.000
Instead of the traditional profit report, a profit report is prepared using the direct costs method.

49:46.000 --> 49:55.000
It is also called a cost calculation with a full distribution of costs or absorption calculation.

49:56.000 --> 50:03.000
The word absorption comes from the word absorb, that is, to absorb, to distribute.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
This method is used for external accounting purposes.

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
It is similar to the marginal profit report, since it pursues the same goals.

50:16.000 --> 50:26.000
It is useful because it focuses on changing the cost and contribution, or marginal profit, of the profit center to the operating income.

50:26.000 --> 50:34.000
That is, if we previously considered the marginal profit formula applicable to one unit of the product,

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
now we can apply the same approach to the entire production or trading unit.

50:43.000 --> 50:49.000
Direct costing is used to evaluate the work of a profit center.

50:49.000 --> 51:02.000
The variable cost of the sold goods and the variable components of commercial and administrative expenses are subtracted from the sale to obtain the marginal profit for the profit center.

51:03.000 --> 51:11.000
All the managed permanent costs are subtracted from the gross margin to determine the operating income.

51:12.000 --> 51:20.000
It includes the permanent production costs and the permanent commercial costs.

51:21.000 --> 51:38.000
When preparing a profit report in the traditional format, all production costs are related to the cost of the sold goods.

51:38.000 --> 51:54.000
I want to remind you that the cost of the sold goods, which you probably studied in the main course of accounting, is the amount paid for the goods that were sold.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
The cost of the sold goods is recognized at the time of the sale of the goods.

52:00.000 --> 52:14.000
That is, we buy goods, store them, and after they are sold, the cost of the sold goods is part of the cost of the sale.

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
The cost of the sold goods is subtracted from the sale to obtain the gross margin.

52:21.000 --> 52:28.000
Then, the variable permanent costs of the sale are subtracted from the gross margin to determine the operating income.

52:28.000 --> 52:38.000
This is the structure of the profit report in the traditional format, which is known from the accounting course.

52:39.000 --> 52:51.000
Now we will compare the profit report in the Direct Cost system and the profit report in the traditional format.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
What is the similarity and the difference?

52:55.000 --> 53:10.000
The profit report in the traditional format is the sale minus the cost of the sold goods equals the gross margin minus the period costs.

53:10.000 --> 53:25.000
What are the period costs? These are commercial costs, administrative costs, operating expenses that were allowed in the specified period.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
The difference between the gross margin and the period costs is the profit of the center.

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
Now let's see what the Direct Cost report looks like.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
Sales minus all variable costs.

53:43.000 --> 53:52.000
Please note that the cost of the sold goods is not included in the cost of the goods.

53:53.000 --> 54:06.000
It does not include the variable costs that were in the commercial and administrative costs, which is a necessary part of any profit report.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
We subtract all variable costs here.

54:11.000 --> 54:17.000
And we get not a gross margin, but a marginal profit.

54:17.000 --> 54:25.000
This is a marginal profit, a marginal contribution to the coverage of the constant costs.

54:26.000 --> 54:45.000
And then we take not the period costs, but all the constant costs, that is, the investments that were made and which do not depend on how the volume of the produced or sold goods changes.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
And so we get the profit of the profit center.

54:51.000 --> 54:58.000
We see that the traditional profit report and the Direct Cost report differ.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
How can this be agreed upon with the requirement for accounting?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
It is very simple.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
The traditional profit report is a part of the financial accounting.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
It can be used as a tax accounting.

55:15.000 --> 55:22.000
It can be used to disclose information for financial markets.

55:23.000 --> 55:30.000
At the same time, the profit report on the Direct Cost system is a part of the administrative accounting.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
It is a part of the administrative accounting.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
And its purpose is to serve for the analysis and adoption of administrative decisions.

55:40.000 --> 55:48.000
The Direct Cost profit report groups the costs according to whether they are variable or constant.

55:49.000 --> 56:04.000
The traditional profit report groups the costs according to whether they are the costs of the goods sold or produced or the period costs.

56:05.000 --> 56:11.000
Again, we see that there are different purposes of the report.

56:12.000 --> 56:21.000
Now let's analyze what the accounting and administrative accounting can be used for.

56:22.000 --> 56:30.000
We know that the administrative accounting pursues two main goals.

56:30.000 --> 56:41.000
The main goal is to manage, that is, to make decisions aimed at the future and to control, which is aimed at the past.

56:42.000 --> 56:52.000
The traditional profit report, being a financial report, being an accounting report, can also serve as the purpose of the administrative accounting,

56:53.000 --> 57:00.000
where it controls how the costs were made in the past period.

57:00.000 --> 57:11.000
How effectively the goods were bought, at the right price, corresponding to the level of sales,

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
what were the commercial administrative costs, that is, what were the costs of the period.

57:18.000 --> 57:29.000
Thus, the business can be controlled based on the traditional profit report, which is what it exists for.

57:30.000 --> 57:42.000
However, the Direct Cost profit report is designed and specifically designed to make administrative decisions.

57:42.000 --> 57:50.000
This report serves as the basis for making decisions for the future operation of the company.

57:51.000 --> 58:08.000
Now we will see how the difference between the Direct Cost profit report and the traditional profit report works,

58:08.000 --> 58:13.000
and how the profit report works with the same data for the same company.

58:14.000 --> 58:27.000
So, we see that the sales of this company are 25,000 conditional units,

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
which can be rubles, in this case, conditional units,

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
because they have nothing to do with real numbers.

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
This is an example. 25,000 is the sales, and this is the sales.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
In both reports, the quantities are the same.

58:47.000 --> 58:52.000
Next, we have the cost of the sold goods.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
What is the difference between the cost of the sold goods?

58:55.000 --> 59:08.000
We see the variable cost of the sold goods, 15,750, which is the value of the sold goods.

59:09.000 --> 59:21.000
But in the traditional report, we see that the cost of the sold goods is 17,450, that is, more.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
What is this?

59:24.000 --> 59:38.000
This is the cost of the sold goods, which is the cost of the production of the goods, and the storage.

59:39.000 --> 59:47.000
The cost of the production of the goods can include both variable and constant production costs.

59:48.000 --> 59:58.000
The cost of the sold goods is the cost of the variable sold goods and the constant production costs.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Thus, the two quantities give 17,450.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000
When we subtract the cost of the sold goods from the volume of sales in the traditional profit report,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
we get the volume margin, which is 7,550.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
A lot of coefficients are based on the analysis of this factor.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Here, in the profit report, we see the variable commercial costs,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
which also include the variable cost of the sold goods and the variable commercial costs.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
After all, our goal is to group all the variable costs.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
The difference between them will give the marginal profit.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
The marginal profit will be equal to 6,000, and it differs from the value of the volume margin.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Next, we subtract the constant production costs from the direct cost profit report.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
At the same time, in the traditional report, we start to subtract the variable commercial costs,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
which have already been subtracted from the direct cost profit report.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Next, we subtract the constant commercial costs from the direct cost profit report,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
after which we get the profit margin.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And in the same way, the constant commercial costs are subtracted from the traditional profit report.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Why are they subtracted here, despite the fact that they are constant?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Because here we are not interested in the constant or variable costs.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Here we are not interested in how much these costs depend on how our costs change

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
with the increase or change in the volume of the product that is produced or sold.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Therefore, the last step of the calculation is the same.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Thus, we can see that the profit margin of the profit center in both cases will be equal to 2,000,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
that is, the same value.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But, I repeat, the traditional profit margin is oriented towards the purpose of control,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
reporting, and taxation.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Taxation is calculated according to the existing methods of calculating the corresponding data.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.000
At the same time, the direct cost profit report is intended for management analysis.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
How is the assessment of the work of the profit center carried out using the direct costing method?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:08.000
The profit center manager can measure and assess non-financial information.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000
It includes a report of the work performed, which changes depending on the type of center of responsibility.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Let us remind you that the center of responsibility is the profit center,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000
the cost center, and the investment center.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The center of profit, the center of costs, and the center of investment.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It contains a general theme.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
It compares the actual results of the center's work with its planned figures.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:53.000
If the center of profit or profit center aims to compare the planned profit with the actual profit,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
the center of costs will compare the actual costs with the budgetary or planned costs.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
The center of investment, in addition to the costs and profits,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
will also compare the budgetary and capital investments.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
That is, how the capital investment plan is implemented and how effective it is.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
The report of the work performed of any of the centers of responsibility focuses on the differences,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000
because it is not important what was done and what was planned,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
but what was planned and what was done differ.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Then these differences will be analyzed separately.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Only the points that the managers can manage will be included.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Those points that are outside the manager's control will not be included.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000
The Center of Profit and Capital Investment

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So, we have studied how we need to make decisions

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and how to apply the management accounting methods to make decisions.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
We have discussed the general idea of what management analysis is used for.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:56.000
We have studied the types of costs and costs.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
We have divided the costs into direct and indirect costs.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:10.000
We have studied the point of payback, the constant costs, the variable costs,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000
the marginal profit and the point of payback.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Then we have moved on to the planning of the assortment of products.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
For this purpose, we also needed to introduce the concept of the marginal profit coefficient

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and use the marginal profit coefficient in order to distribute the types of products

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and plan the assortment using the point of payback and costs.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Then we have played with various approaches to price education.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
What happens if we increase the price of a product?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
How will our operational profit change?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
What will happen if we decrease the price of a product?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
How will our operational profit change?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:11.000
After this, we have studied the distribution of costs

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and the distribution of costs directly to the costs of labor, materials and overhead expenses.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Based on this, we have considered two methods.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
We have considered the standard costing method

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
and the direct costing method, which is used to conduct management analysis

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and to make decisions.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Thank you for your attention.
