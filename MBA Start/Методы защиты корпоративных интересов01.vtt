00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Good afternoon.

00:01.000 --> 00:07.000
The issues of corporate security are in front of any company in business,

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
regardless of what this company does.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
These may be financial issues, production issues,

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
or services, but in any case, security issues are there and they need to be solved.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
The construction of corporate security systems is individual,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
depending on the company's features, on the threat,

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
but there are common approaches to the construction of corporate security systems.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
It is built from separate subsystems, which are called information security,

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
personnel security, technical security, economic security, and other subsystems.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
We will talk about these subsystems and how corporate security systems are built

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
in today's seminar.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
The topic of our seminar is corporate security, organization and management practices.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
The first topic we will discuss today is the general issues of building a corporate security system.

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
These are quite general issues, but without them you will not be able to build a corporate security system.

01:15.000 --> 01:24.000
What does a person or a department that deals with corporate security issues usually start with?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
The first thing they usually start with is the creation of a document.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
The document can be called in different ways, I have encountered different names for this document.

01:34.000 --> 01:42.000
The classic name of this document is the concept of ensuring the company's security.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
This is a conceptual document, it is quite theoretical, but it is tied to the real company,

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
to the real threat, to the real object, subject, and so on.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
This document is created, it is usually quite voluminous, it is about 30-40 pages.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
In a mandatory order, it must be approved by the company's management.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
This can be done either through an order or through a confirmation letter.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
The next step is to implement this concept.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
The implementation of this concept also starts with the creation of some documents.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Basically, these are either programs or plans.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
The classic version is a classic plan.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
It usually goes for a year, a list of events, responsibilities, money, deadlines, execution date, and so on.

02:40.000 --> 02:50.000
In order to create this concept, it is necessary to determine some circular stones that exist.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
What do I understand under the circular stones?

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
I will use this board and write it down.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
These are objects.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
The first thing used is the objects.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
What is determined?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
These are security objects.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
It is quite difficult to ensure the security of everything that exists.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
Therefore, some security objects are usually determined and then their security is carried out.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
If we take a standard version of the organization, what do they usually understand under the objects?

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
The first thing is finance.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
In any case, a company has certain financial resources.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
It can be cash, cashless money, shares, bonds, and so on.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
If this money is invested in the wrong place, if it is stolen, then it is clear that a company will have certain problems.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Therefore, finance is usually an object of security.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
To a greater extent, this applies to organizations that work with other people's money.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
To a lesser extent, it applies to companies that work with their own money.

04:15.000 --> 04:24.000
Nevertheless, in almost all companies, financial resources and funds are security objects.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
This can be staff.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
In the vast majority of companies, with the exception of a few, people work.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
If these people resign, get sick, get killed, or something happens to them, it is clear that the company will have problems.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
Staff also tends to commit some illegal actions, so staff is an object of security.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
It can be information resources.

05:02.000 --> 05:12.000
There are no companies in business where all information resources are open.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
All existing information resources are open.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
As a rule, all information resources of a company are divided into two large groups.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
These are open information resources and information resources with limited access.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
I will tell you more about this in the topic of information security.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
Now I will just emphasize that information is an object of security in the vast majority of cases.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
It can be material values.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
The vast majority of companies have certain material values.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
This can be the case with virtual companies.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
These are warehouses with ready-made products, tables, chairs, cars, buildings, etc.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
It is also clear that if this is burned or taken away, then the company will have certain problems.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
Basically, everything related to the protection of material values is a security block.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
I want to say that in the vast majority of companies, material values are objects of security.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
These can be business processes.

06:41.000 --> 06:54.000
Any business activity consists of business processes.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
This is what the company earns money on.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
Basically, business processes are also objects of security.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
This is not only the case with the security unit.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Many companies are engaged in the protection of business processes.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
The security service or the employee on the line of corporate security has certain tasks.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
This is the block called economic security, which we will talk about later.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
This can be the reputation of the company.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
Unfortunately, the technologies of black PR are well developed and well-rounded.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
Therefore, the threats that come to the business from the side of black PR are real and must be protected.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
Here you can include protection against the misuse of trademarks, if it is a patented brand.

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
Here you can include protection against fake products, which are also not uncommon in our market.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Therefore, security issues are often crossed out by the protection of the company's reputation.

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
You can suppress the company in different ways, you can do it economically, legally, illegally, and so on.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
You can do it with the technologies of black PR.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
This is an object of security.

08:30.000 --> 08:39.000
There may be other security objects.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
This is a standard approach to this problem.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
It is necessary to assume that each company can define its own security object.

08:50.000 --> 09:03.000
Now, the second round stone that must be determined before the concept of security is formed.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
These are the subjects.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
The subject of security.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
Who will deal with the security issue?

09:19.000 --> 09:29.000
If you determine a huge number of security objects, but do not determine who will deal with them, then it will be pointless.

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
In commercial structures, there are several levels of approach to security objects.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
As I said in my opening statement, corporate security issues are in front of any company.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
Therefore, in any case, a certain subject must be determined.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
If we take the first level, I call it the bottom level, then this is the management.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
Who is engaged in the first level?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
This is the management.

10:05.000 --> 10:18.000
In companies where security objects are not determined, the manager decides these issues.

10:18.000 --> 10:27.000
I can't say that this is a good option, because the management has something to do with security issues.

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
But in some companies, mainly small companies, which do not have a lot of money to spend on security,

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
which do not have many threats, this level may be acceptable.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
When the company grows, when the threats intensify, when there is something to lose,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
when there is money to spend on security, then the second level is applied.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I will not write the word level.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
This is a work in partnership.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I call it a work in partnership.

11:04.000 --> 11:17.000
That is, a certain official who exists in the company jointly issues a security issue.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
What official should I ask these questions to?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
There are different approaches.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
You can ask this question to some deputy director.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
I often came across the head of the legal department, who asked these questions.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
This is a work in partnership.

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
As with any work in partnership, it is not very effective, because it is very difficult to sit on two chairs,

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
to perform work in two directions at the same time is quite difficult.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
Therefore, in cases when there is an opportunity, the third level is applied.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
The third level is a separate position.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
A separate position.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
How this position will be called is not so important.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
You can come across the practice of a security assistant,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
maybe a deputy security director,

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
or maybe just some completely non-speaking position as a consultant or advisor.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
The most important thing is that this is a separate position.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
A person who occupies this position solves security issues.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
That is, his main functional duties are to solve security issues.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
It should be noted that one person cannot do serious work.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
Therefore, this position is usually an organizing position.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
That is, a person attracts organizations that provide these services in various areas of security.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
And this person who occupies this position is responsible for this and coordinates this work.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
This is a very common and widely applied option.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
There are a variety of this option.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I would call it the fourth level.

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
This is a security council plus a separate position.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
Security council.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
Plus a separate position.

13:30.000 --> 13:38.000
What is a security council?

13:38.000 --> 13:47.000
Usually, it is a kind of advisory body that is formed in an organization according to its positions.

13:48.000 --> 13:56.000
For example, all the heads of departments of a company are included in this security council.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
It can periodically gather once a year, once a month, once a quarter, depending on the need.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
It can develop a certain ideology of security, develop a certain direction of activity.

14:09.000 --> 14:20.000
And a person who occupies this separate position will carry out these requirements and decisions that this security council produces.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
This is also a fairly common and effective option.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
There are levels 5 and 6.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
The fifth level is the customer service.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
The sixth level is the security service.

14:50.000 --> 15:02.000
What are the advantages and disadvantages of the fifth and sixth levels?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
What is customer service?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
In fact, this is a classic outsourcing.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
There are quite a few security holdings that provide these services.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
The company becomes the basis of a certain contract for the maintenance of this holding.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
And the security holding solves all the security issues of this company.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
The security service is a structural division of the company.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
There are certain features.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
Licensing is required, a charter is required, which is agreed upon by the internal affairs agencies.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
This division is not a legal entity, but the founder of the company in which this security service is created.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
Perhaps, the security service is the best option that is possible in commercial structures.

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
In what cases do they usually create a security service?

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
First, the security service is a fairly expensive enterprise.

16:07.000 --> 16:15.000
Therefore, the security service is necessary when there is a serious threat and when there is money to neutralize these threats.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
The security service is usually created when there are different areas of activity.

16:21.000 --> 16:28.000
I have encountered a security service that consists of one person, one boss.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
It seems to me that this is quite pointless.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
It is necessary to create a security service when there are different areas of activity.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
It can be a security area, a detective area.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
What is the advantage of the security service?

16:42.000 --> 16:50.000
The advantage is that the information and activities of the company on the corporate security line do not go anywhere.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
This is its own division and the information does not go anywhere.

16:56.000 --> 17:06.000
Unlike outsourcing, where the information is initially supposed to be transferred to another organization.

17:06.000 --> 17:14.000
Everything related to corporate security is closed, so it is not always convenient and good.

17:14.000 --> 17:22.000
Outsourcing is a relatively inexpensive event.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
It is much less expensive.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
The disadvantage of outsourcing is that it is closely related to a certain contract.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
The company with this security holding is a contract.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
Only within this contract is interaction carried out.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
The security service is its own structural division.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
It can be asked some questions.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
For example, what is the nature of the company?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
What will you never do within the framework of outsourcing?

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
The disadvantage of the security service is that it requires a license.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
It requires a consent from the internal affairs agency.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
It requires a certain bureaucracy.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
The inspectors from the licensing and authorization system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will come.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
This is a fairly bureaucratic system.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
But this is a certain officio, this is a certain official relationship, including from the internal affairs agency.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
What to choose?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
The company must decide for itself.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
There are no universal solutions applicable to the entire company.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
It is necessary to look at the situation based on the threat, based on the money, based on the demand for expediency.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
In some cases, it is necessary to create a security service.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
In some cases, it may be limited to either a separate position,

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
or the establishment of a subscription service with some security holding.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
This is the second point that you must determine for yourself

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
before creating this concept of security.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
The next cornerstone that you must determine is the goals and tasks of security.

19:00.000 --> 19:09.000
The goal is the same for all organizations that operate on the security line.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
The goal is the stable functioning of the company.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
As a rule, where the company functions steadily,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
including the well-working security service,

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
where there are problems, some losses on the line of operation of the company,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
including the poorly functioning security service.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
The achievement of this goal is based on different tasks,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
on the solution of different tasks.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
It can be protection of information, it can be protection of business processes,

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
depending on the objects that we have determined for ourselves.

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
The goal of the security system

19:53.000 --> 20:02.000
Now we will move on to the section that explains

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
what the system of corporate security should consist of,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
that is, the structure of corporate security.

20:10.000 --> 20:20.000
I draw it in the form of a wall that encircles the company,

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
a wall that holds the circular defense around the company,

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
a wall that consists of individual bricks, individual elements.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
These bricks, these elements can be more or less,

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
but to some extent they should be present when you build a system,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
namely, a system of corporate security.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
It is clear that if there is not enough brick in the wall,

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
there will be a hole, then the construction of this wall will be ineffective.

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
Therefore, we will draw it as a brick wall in the form of bricks.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
As a rule, when this wall is built,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
one central brick is allocated,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
that is, based on the threat, one large central brick is chosen.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
And around it, the rest of the bricks are built.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
The structure.

21:14.000 --> 21:22.000
These bricks that I will draw now,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
I draw them for the sake of simplicity of understanding.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Because it is clear that in real life they can find each other,

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
they can intersect, they can duplicate each other.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
But nevertheless, the most important thing is that to some extent

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
all these bricks are present in this wall.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
The first brick.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
The first does not mean that it is the most important,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
it will just be the first.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Because in every company, the main brick is naturally its own.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Let's call it information security.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
Information security.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
The term information security is quite fashionable.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
It has been fashionable since 2000,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
when the doctrine was adopted,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
there is such information security of the Russian Federation.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
What is information security?

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
It is the state of security of the company's information resources.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
This is the ultimate goal,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
this is the state of security.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
This information security is achieved by a process

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
called information protection.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
What is the complexity of this brick?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
The complexity is that, first of all,

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
you need to look at what forms the information takes.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Because information can take many different forms.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
These can be documents,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
which can be on paper,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
they can be on electronic media,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
this can be electronic information.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Information can be in people's heads,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
this is also information that needs to be protected.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Information can be in the form of industrial waste,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
this is also some kind of information that needs to be protected.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
When they start to create this brick,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
which is called information security,

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
the first thing they do is to determine the information that needs to be protected,

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
and the second is to build the forms in which this information can be presented.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
And they build protection based on these forms.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
The complexity is that the vast majority of information resources

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
are now in electronic form,

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
so to speak, information security has a certain angle,

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
which is connected with the protection of information presented in electronic form.

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
We will talk in more detail in the section called information security.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
How is it built?

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
What directions of building this brick are related to information security?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I will draw it here.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
If the information is presented in the form of material or paper documents,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
and in general in the form of documents,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
then it is necessary to create a confidential production case.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
One of the directions is a confidential production case.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
A confidential production case.

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
The second direction is...

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
I have already said that a lot of information resources,

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
closed information resources are presented in electronic form.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
The second direction is IT security,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
that is, the protection of information resources presented in electronic form.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
IT security.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Information, protection of information can be organized by measures.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
Therefore, the so-called organizational measures are widely used.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
Organizational measures.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Or events.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Under the organizational measures,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
this is a fairly large set of events.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
You can even include the restriction of access to information,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
control and access regime in the company, video surveillance.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
These are all some kind of organizational measures of information protection.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
In organizational measures,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
this is the breaking of information into parts.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
These are also organizational measures of protection.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
If you have some information,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
a formula that you want to protect,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
then it is broken into parts,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
let's say, into several parts.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
These parts are territorially divided.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
That is, one part is located in one city,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
the second part is located in another city,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
the third part is located in a third city.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
And different people have access to these parts.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Therefore, the criminal, in order to get all this formula,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
all this information,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
has to collect it from different people

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
and from territorially divided objects.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Which is naturally much more difficult

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
than if this formula was in one place.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
This is a classic division of information into parts,

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
a classic organizational principle of protection.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
This was used quite widely before.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
And now, if we remember how the secret of Coca-Cola was protected,

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
then one of the methods was in the 1920s or 1930s,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
it was an organizational one.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
This formula was really divided into three parts.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Each of these parts had access to only a certain number of people.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
Here, the direction is legal measures.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Legal measures.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
In order to create information security,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
this block called information security,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
legal measures can also be applied.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
For example, if you create a commercial secret regime,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
that is, if, having read the law of commercial secrecy,

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
you decided to create a commercial secret regime,

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
then you must apply some legal measures.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Approval of a list of information,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
creation of certain instructions,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
these are legal measures.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
I will stop at technical measures.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
These are technical measures.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Technical measures.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
These are technical measures for the closure of various channels of information leakage.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
Basically, this is protection against industrial espionage.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
In order to ensure that information does not go through

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
some technical solutions on technical channels.

28:16.000 --> 28:23.000
And here I would probably add another point.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
These are personnel measures.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Personnel measures.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
That is, information is in people's heads in any case,

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
and to conduct some events,

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
that is, personnel measures,

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
so that people who know your commercial secrets,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
know your classified information,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
so that they do not disclose it.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
This is a whole complex called personnel measures and personnel events.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
I will tell you more about them when we talk about personnel security.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
So, the first brick.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
The second brick.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Let's call it personnel security.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Personnel security.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
So, threats, I already said, I will remind you a little more,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
which come from a person.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
There are basically three groups of threats.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
This is the enforcement of illegal actions,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
this is the disclosure of information,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
and this is the enforcement of incompetent actions.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
Therefore, basically, all events aimed at personnel security,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
they are divided into three large groups.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
These are measures related to protection

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
from committing illegal actions.

29:51.000 --> 29:58.000
Committing illegal actions.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Well, illegal actions, of course,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
are those actions that violate certain rules of law.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
First of all, these are actions that fall under the articles of the Criminal Code,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
the Administrative Code, the Labor Code, and so on.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
This is protection from disclosure of information.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
From disclosure of information.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
In principle, if you go into detail,

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
disclosure of information is a private case of committing illegal actions.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
But in personnel security, this area is distinguished separately,

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
simply because it is quite relevant and has a certain specificity.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
This is, of course, disclosure of confidential information,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
that is, information with limited access.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
And the third area is protection from incompetent actions.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
Protection from incompetent actions.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
This is not really a question of the security service.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
As a rule, protection from incompetent actions

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
does not take part in the security service,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
although sometimes it is involved in this direction.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
The threat coming from this direction is really real,

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
because you can build a very powerful,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
very modern, good security system,

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
but incompetent people will simply ruin the company,

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
and whatever security you build, it will be completely ineffective.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
A little bit about the peculiarity of this brick,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
which is called personnel security.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
First of all, this is the biggest,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
and as a rule the most problematic,

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
and the weakest link in the entire security system.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
The vast majority of problems that the company has

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
are related to personnel security.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
There is a certain statistic,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
that according to the disclosure of information,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
about 80-85% of the information,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
the classified information,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
is either used by personnel security,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
or by incorrect documents.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
And only about 15% of the information

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
is used by other means,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
like industrial espionage, hackers, and so on.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Why does this happen?

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
It is clear, because the use of industrial espionage equipment,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
well, first of all, its use is immediately

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
subject to the corresponding articles of the Criminal Code,

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
which is not good for the customer.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
And second, the equipment of industrial espionage

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
is quite expensive.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
To get the same information,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
you can use a much simpler,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
more accessible method.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
Well, to take the right person to a restaurant,

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
to drink vodka, then wine, then beer,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
and get the same information.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Without violating any articles of the Criminal Code.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
We do not take the scrimmage component.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
And this method of obtaining information

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
can be much cheaper

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
than the use of industrial espionage equipment.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Therefore, as a rule, everything related to

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
personnel safety is quite relevant.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
The peculiarity of this brick is that

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
it is quite stable,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
that is, it changes very slowly.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Everything related to personnel safety is psychology.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Psychology of people changes very slowly.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
The methods of influence of one person on another,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
as they were in ancient Rome,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
probably remain the same.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
The same bribery, the same blackmail,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
the same insult.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Maybe some torture left the first place,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
but the second or the third.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
And personnel safety issues

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
are solved approximately the same

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
regardless of what the company does.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
That is, whether it is financers,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
whether it is manufacturers,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
whether it is the service sector,

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
personnel safety issues are solved approximately the same.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
But the psychology of people working in different organizations

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
is approximately the same.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Unlike, say, some technical solutions

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
that can change very quickly

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
and which are built individually

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
depending on what kind of company.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
This is personnel safety.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
This is a brick called personnel safety.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
There is a brick,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
let's call it the third brick.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
It is also related to the human factor.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
The third brick is personnel safety.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Personal safety.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Personal safety is mainly applied

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
to the first persons of the company

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
in order for them to work,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
make some decisions.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
These decisions were provided

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
with a certain level of safety.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Basically, everything that concerns

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
personal safety is built in three directions.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
This is physical protection.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Physical protection.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
This is legal protection.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Legal protection.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
This is psychological protection.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Psychological protection.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Legal protection.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Physical protection is the work of bodyguards.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
This is the provision of body safety.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
There are a lot of problems

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
related to the legal side.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Unfortunately, according to our legislation,

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
bodyguards work, they exist.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
Unfortunately, there are no bodyguards in the legal side.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
When I will talk about the principles

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
and the principle of legality,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I will talk about it in detail.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Legal protection is the legal provision

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
of decision-making by the company's management.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
Basically, this is the work of lawyers.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
If the lawyers have done poorly,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
it is the work of lawyers.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
This is the legal provision

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
of decision-making by the company's first person.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
Psychological protection is the work of psychologists.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
This is the psychological provision

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
of decision-making

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
so that people who make decisions

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
make decisions in a state of psychological stability,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
psychological balance,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
so that there is no decision-making

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
in a state of some kind of effect.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
Basically, this brick is built

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
in these three directions.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Of course, it can be further painted

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
as some kind of safe food,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
safe swimming and everything else.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
But usually this is not done,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
it is quite expensive.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
And in the best case,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
in the maximum version of commercial structures,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
personal security is built

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
in these three directions.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
The fourth brick

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
is called economic security.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
Economic security.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I have already said that economic security

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
is basically the security of business processes

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
that take place in the company.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
This brick is built,

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
which is called economic security,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
depending on the business processes.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
I also focus on economic security.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Economic security is not only

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
the security service,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
but many departments

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
that are present in the company.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
If we build economic security

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
from the position of the security service,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
then, as a rule,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
this is the business intelligence.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Business intelligence.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
This is the direction

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
of the security service.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
What is business intelligence?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I will describe it in two words.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
There are different terms.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
There is the concept of business intelligence,

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
there is the concept of competitive intelligence,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
there is the concept of corporate intelligence,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
business intelligence.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
In fact, this is information analytics.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
These are two directions.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
This is the collection of information,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
this is its analysis.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
There is an operational direction,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
but in fact, this is information analytics.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
From the point of view of economic risks,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
from the point of view of checking

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
the compatibility of the partner,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and everything else.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
There is a direction,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
the so-called economic management,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
and the minimization of economic risks.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Management and minimization.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Economic risks.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
This is not always done by the security service,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
although it is attracted to solving this problem.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
For example, to minimize economic risks

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
from the point of view of duplicating

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
some economic processes.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
If there is only one raw material supplier,

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
then it is clear that this is an unstable system,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
and from the point of view of security,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
these are risks, these are threats.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
As soon as this supplier is lost,

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
the supply of some materials is lost.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
There should be duplication.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Supply duplication,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
supplier duplication,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
consumer duplication, and so on.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
What is the security service doing?

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Basically, this is protection against fraud.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Protection against fraud.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Here we are talking about fraud

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
not from the point of view of the company staff,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
but from the point of view of other organizations

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
and fraud from the point of view of other legal entities.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Well, maybe, for example,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
protection against hostile absorption.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Hostile absorption.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
This is also a fairly fashionable term,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
protection against hostile absorption.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
What is hostile absorption?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
This is the control over the company's assets

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
in the face of the company's owner,

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
the company's management.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
There are different schemes.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
There are white schemes,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
there are gray schemes,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
there are black schemes.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Security services are involved in solving issues

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
to protect against hostile absorption.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
I draw your attention to the fact that they are involved

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
because many issues are related to lawyers,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
many issues are related to the company's management.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Basically, this is informational work,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
this is a relationship with state bodies,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
including the police,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
to protect against hostile absorption.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
This is physical protection of the building,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
so that the company does not physically gain access

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
to the company's territory, and so on.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Now, in general, protection against hostile absorption

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
is quite relevant,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
although, in my opinion,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
this peak has already passed in Moscow,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
now it is slightly shifting to the regions.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
This is already a secondary redistribution of property on the market.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
This is for economic security.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
There is a direction of technical security.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Basically, technical security,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
these bricks,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
are divided into three large groups,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
into three components.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
This is engineering and technical security,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
this is technical security,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
and this is IT security.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The fifth brick.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
This is engineering and technical security.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Technical security.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
What is engineering and technical security?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Engineering and technical security,

42:49.000 --> 42:54.000
in fact, is engineering and technical equipment of the territory.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Depending on the territory,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
depending on the object,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
engineering and technical security

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
is built in different directions.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Although there are some common approaches,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
some common points,

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
which are connected with measures.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I will draw like this, as I usually do.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
This is fire safety.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Fire safety.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
This is relevant for any company,

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
because every day something burns down somewhere.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Fire protection,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
fire safety,

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
is also one of the components of corporate security.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
At any exhibition,

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
at a security technology forum,

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
there will be stands dedicated to fire safety.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Here it is clear what needs to be done,

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
because there are certain requirements from firefighters,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
these requirements are desirable to be met.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
Now there are a lot of measures for fire safety,

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
starting with fire paint, doors, stickers, fire extinguishers,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
and so on.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
There are a lot of measures.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
They just need to be implemented.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
There is a video surveillance system.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
The installation of video surveillance systems

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
is an integral part of engineering and technical security.

44:29.000 --> 44:34.000
The most effective is a combined video surveillance system.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Some video cameras are installed openly,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
some are installed secretly.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
There are some legal issues

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
where video surveillance ends,

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
where surveillance as a operational event ends,

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
and where surveillance as a security television begins.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
In general, this mechanism is well developed,

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
and video surveillance is widely used.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
There are a lot of companies that provide these services.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Here, too, it is clear what needs to be done,

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
based on a specific task and a specific goal that you want to achieve.

45:15.000 --> 45:22.000
The next area is the control and pass mode.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
Control and pass mode.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
It is clear that if outsiders visit your enterprise,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
then you don't have to talk about serious security.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
Therefore, the control and pass mode

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
is a component of corporate security

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
and a component of engineering and technical security.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
There are a lot of technical solutions of the control and pass mode.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
These are widely used ASCUT systems,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
automated access control systems.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
They are used when you have a large number of people,

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
more than 300-400 people at the enterprise,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
large factories.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
These ASCUT systems are very effective.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
In small companies, where there are few people,

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
some simplified manual control and pass modes are used.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
The control and pass mode involves not only the control of people

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
who enter the enterprise,

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
but also the creation of zones based on the principle of confidentiality.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
There are some zones in the form of floors,

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
where only certain employees can enter.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
It can be for a certain employee,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
it can be for a certain time,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
that is, you can be there for a certain time,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
and you can't be there for a certain time.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
All this is decided by the control and pass mode.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
There is a measure, there is a direction,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
which is called perimeter protection.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Naturally, where these perimeters exist.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
First of all, it is relevant in those enterprises,

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
which produce something valuable and useful for employees.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
For example, a meat plant, a liquor and vodka plant.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
The security of the perimeters can be relevant.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Some consulting companies,

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
that is, a company that represents the service sector,

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
these problems can be put aside and not be so relevant.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
There can be engineering and technical security.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
These are the most diverse alarm systems.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
Alarm systems for finding, opening windows, doors, etc.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
There is a very large variety of them.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
In principle, there is a methodological feature.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
The distribution of these alarm systems is given.

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
Engineering and technical security can be in some other direction.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
It depends on the object.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
This is engineering and technical equipment territory.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
This brick.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And the other two bricks.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I will also focus on them.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
The sixth brick.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
This is technical security.

48:44.000 --> 48:51.000
Technical security is mainly a protection from information leakage channels.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
I talked a little about it in the section on information security.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
But very often this brick is allocated as a separate component.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
From a physical point of view,

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
there are three channels of information transmission.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
This is the acoustic channel.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
What is said can be heard.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
This is the visual channel of information leakage.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
What happens can be seen.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
This is the electromagnetic channel of information leakage.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
Where there are electrical signals,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
where information is transmitted through electrical signals,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
there is electromagnetic radiation,

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
which has a tendency to pass through different barriers.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
It can be recorded.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
This is also like a channel of information leakage.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
The vast majority of the equipment of industrial espionage that exists,

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
it uses any of these channels of information leakage.

49:46.000 --> 49:54.000
Therefore, technical security is built on the protection of these three channels of information leakage.

49:56.000 --> 50:08.000
Protection from the acoustic channel of information leakage.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
Protection from the visual channel.

50:13.000 --> 50:26.000
And protection from PEMIN.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
There is such a term.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
PEMIN is a side electromagnetic radiation.

50:31.000 --> 50:38.000
Now, in general, there are many companies on the market that provide these services.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
Basically, they are positioned in the market of information protection.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
Companies that, from a technical point of view,

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
not from a personnel point of view, not from a legal point of view,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
but from a technical point of view,

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
protect these channels of information leakage.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
And the last brick on which I will dwell is the seventh brick.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
This is IT security.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
IT security.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
What is the situation?

51:14.000 --> 51:21.000
Now this brick is gaining more and more popularity and more and more importance.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
What is IT security?

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
This is the state of security of the company's information resources presented in electronic form.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
The complexity of this brick.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Firstly, it changes very quickly.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
Unlike, for example, personnel security, which I mentioned, it changes very quickly.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
Literally every day there are new technical solutions,

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
new threats, new viruses, new protection and everything else.

51:48.000 --> 51:55.000
A person who deals with IT security should sit on it every day.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
That is, to do IT security, just by reading a book or going to an exhibition,

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
this is unrealistic, this is pointless, unfortunately, no one does this.

52:03.000 --> 52:11.000
Therefore, IT security should be a separate, well-trained person who will constantly do this.

52:11.000 --> 52:19.000
The difficulty is that this IT guy who deals with IT security is a thing in itself.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
It is very difficult to understand what he does, to understand an unprepared person.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
There have been cases, this is a serious problem,

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
when if an IT security person is subordinate to the head of the security service,

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
then the head of the security service may not understand what the IT security person is doing.

52:38.000 --> 52:44.000
Just because he does not have enough experience, or even education.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Therefore, unfortunately, this is a certain thing in itself.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
There are approaches, personnel approaches to select a specialist in IT security,

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
organizational approaches, what he can do, what he cannot do.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
There is an audit of IT security, which is desirable to apply,

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
including for control of its IT security.

53:04.000 --> 53:12.000
Basically, IT security is solved in three directions.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
This is all about network protection.

53:15.000 --> 53:24.000
That is, the protection of information resources, which are in the company, in network solutions.

53:24.000 --> 53:32.000
This is the protection of autonomous information resources,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
or information resources presented on autonomous carriers.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
Protection of autonomous information.

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
Protection of information.

53:46.000 --> 53:56.000
And this is the protection of information that is transmitted through scattered objects.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
That is, when you need to transmit information from one city to another,

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
using the Internet or some other information systems.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
That is, the protection of information when transmitted between scattered objects.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
Protection of information when transmitted.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
What should I pay attention to?

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
If we consider some trends, what is the trend?

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
The information resources of the company are now about 50 to 50.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
50% are presented in material form, in the form of documents, papers.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
And 50% are presented in electronic form.

54:44.000 --> 54:50.000
If we take 10 years ago, then basically all information resources were presented on paper,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
that is, on material carriers.

54:52.000 --> 54:57.000
I think that in 10 years the main type of information resources,

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
the main type of carriers on which there will be information resources,

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
will be electronic.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
That is, everything will be presented in electronic form.

55:05.000 --> 55:12.000
Material carriers will probably be in the form of some archives or duplication.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
If we look at this problem from the point of view of security,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
from the point of view of protection,

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
then what can be predicted and what can be looked at?

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Look at what are the trends.

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
If we take some paper document,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
how is it protected?

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
In principle, it is protected only by access protection.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
The maximum you can do with it is lock it in some safe.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
Put an armed guard to the safe.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
All this is in some controlled territory.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
That is, you protect access to this document.

55:45.000 --> 55:52.000
Any security system is initially considered imperfect and imperfect,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
because in any case, all this can be hacked.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
As soon as the safe is hacked and the document is obtained,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
this document is presented in an open form.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
That is, we do not have any secret inscriptions,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
secret ink, disappearing, and so on.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
They are there, but in everyday life they are usually not used.

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
If we take an electronic carrier,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
that is, some kind of electronic array of information,

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
then the direction of protection is built on two strategic lines.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
That is, protection is built directly on access,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
in the form of access restrictions,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
in the form of electronic identifiers,

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
in the form of some kind of biometric identity recognition systems.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
And the second direction is protection of the document itself.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
What cannot be done with paper.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
The protection of the document itself is mainly done with cryptography,

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
that is, cryptographic means of protection.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
If in a simplified version,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
some information is taken,

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
a kilobyte or megabyte of information is divided into 10 parts,

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
all this is done in a very simplified version.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
These parts are re-piled up,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
the tenth part is on the second,

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
the second part is on the fourth,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
the fourth part is on the first.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Thus, a certain encryption of the document occurs.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
The value of the document is not lost from this.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
That is, it is possible to decrypt in the future,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
that is, to put these parts in place,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
and the value of the document will be preserved.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
That is, there will be the same document.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
What cannot be done with paper.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
You cannot tear it,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
re-pile it,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
preserving the value of the document.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
This is possible,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
but the value of the document naturally disappears from this.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
Therefore, the direction of protection of information resources

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
presented in the electronic form is more modern,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
and can be done more perfectly,

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
because it will go in different strategic directions.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
If we talk about the destruction of documents,

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
if you have 10 volumes of materials that need to be urgently destroyed,

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
and they are presented on paper,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
then you will not eat them,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
tear them,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
and destroy them in a short time.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
If you have the same 10 volumes of materials,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
presented in the electronic form,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
then you can do it all

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
in a matter of seconds,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
and you will be guaranteed from not being restored.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Even from this point of view,

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
from the point of view of the destruction of documents,

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
electronic documents,

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
they are much more convenient to work with,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and to a greater extent they can be protected.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
So, the walls and bricks,

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
they are already individual,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
depending on what the company does.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
That is, if you have some kind of factory,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
which produces something

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
and some waste is poured into the river,

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
then, probably,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
environmental safety issues will be relevant.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
There is some kind of sea port,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
environmental safety issues

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
could be relevant.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
But, as a rule, in the standard version,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
these are just the classic bricks,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
the classic subsystems

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
for the construction of the operating safety system.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Now, at one more point,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I would like to draw your attention

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
to the principles that must be observed

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
when organizing

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
the corporate safety system.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
There are quite a lot of them.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
At some points,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I will focus more on the details,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
at some I will just talk about

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
the fact that they exist.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
But, I say again,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
the principles are necessary for the implementation.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
The principles.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
The first principle

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I will probably stop at

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
is the principle of legality.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Legality.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I will not call for

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
compliance with legality,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
this is not the topic of my seminar.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Just keep in mind

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
that everything you do

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
on the corporate safety line

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
is always clear whether you do it legally

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
or illegally.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The reason is simple and banal.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
The legislation on corporate safety

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
is, unfortunately,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
very imperfect.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The main law on which

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
corporate safety lives

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
is the law on private security

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
and detective activity.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The law that was adopted

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
in 1992,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
that is, before the Constitution was adopted,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
before the law on weapons,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
on the police, on the State Security,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
on security, and so on.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The law was adopted as a transitional law.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It was clear in the early 90s

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
that the state was not able

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
to protect the emerging business.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
It was adopted, I would say,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
quite a political decision

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
that corporate security

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
would be the direction of business.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I note that this is a political decision

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
because the law

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
on the protection of the business

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
is not a political decision.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
For example, in Belarus,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
corporate security

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
does not exist in the form

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
that it exists in Russia.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
It is a state-owned business.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It was decided that

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
corporate security

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
would be the direction of business.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Naturally, it was necessary

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
to create some temporary rules

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
for this business.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And this law was created

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
on the private security

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and detective activity.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
This law was temporary.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It was written on the knee.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Unfortunately, there is nothing

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
more permanent than temporary.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
This law has existed

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
since 1992.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
It has undergone changes,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
but nevertheless it exists.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
In general, we have very few laws

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
that have remained since 1992.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
As a rule, all the legislation

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
in the early 90s has already been rewritten.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Therefore,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
unfortunately,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
the law on corporate security

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
is not perfect

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
from the perspective of the regulatory base.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I have already given examples

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
of bodyguards.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
We have bodyguards.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
There is even such an organization

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
as the National Association of Bodyguards.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But they do not exist.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You can contact the CHOP,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
which provides services

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
for the physical protection of people,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
that is, for the work of bodyguards.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
CHOP will give you bodyguards.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
But do not be surprised

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
that the contract that will be concluded

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
will be concluded on the protection

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
of material values.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
According to our law,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
there is protection of life

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
and health of people,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
but a bodyguard,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
if he is protected

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
by the contract of life and health of a person,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
can only be armed

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
with special means,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
such as a whistle, a baton, and so on.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It is clear that no respected businessman

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
wants his life to be protected

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
by a person with a whistle and a baton.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It is clear and obvious.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Therefore, all the contracts that are concluded

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
are on the protection of material values.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
That is, what is on a person,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
such as a gold chain,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
a watch, a briefcase

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
with documents,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
is located near a person.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
In reality, this is the work of a bodyguard.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Although according to the documents,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
this is the protection of material values.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
It is clear that if, God forbid,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
a bodyguard uses firearms,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
if he kills someone,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
he will have a lot of serious problems.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Therefore,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
unfortunately,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
the legislation is very imperfect.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Many questions arise

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
about the limitation

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
of the termination of

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
operational events,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
where the events

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
that are held by the security service begin.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Can the security service

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
listen to corporate telephone

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and negotiate with employees?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Where is the video surveillance system installed?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Can the video surveillance system

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
be installed in the toilets or not?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
There are a lot of questions,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
including legal ones.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
There are some algorithms,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
some solutions.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But keep in mind

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
that everything you do

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
on the corporate security line

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
is a very thin line

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
between legality and illegality.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
This is in relation to legality.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
The second principle

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
that is desirable to be implemented

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
is the complexity.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Everything you do

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
on the corporate security line

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
must be done in a complex.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Complexity implies

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
ensuring the safety

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
of all objects

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
that you have identified

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and the complexity implies

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
ensuring the security

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
of all objects

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
that you have identified

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and the complexity implies

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
ensuring the safety

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
of all objects.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I have personally encountered

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
a case when a person,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
a company manager,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
installed a cryptographic

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
protection of computer information

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
about 10 years ago.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Nevertheless,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
it was not effective

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
because the documents

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
that he protected

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
with cryptography

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
were printed

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and were lying on the tables,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
under the tables,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
in the garbage bins,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
etc.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It was clear

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
that the principle of complexity

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
was violated.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It was ineffective

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and unwise

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
to install expensive

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
systems of the SCIS

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and the so-called

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
cryptographic protection

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
of the computer information

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
in the database.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Therefore,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
try to apply

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
this principle of complexity.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
There is a principle

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
of temporariness.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The principle of temporariness

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
implies that

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
everything that you do

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
in the field of security

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
should be done

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
in advance.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You should always take

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
one step

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
towards the potential

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
violator.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
There is a saying

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
that it is too late

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
to drink borscht

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
when the kidneys fall off.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
It is very relevant

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
in the field of security.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
As soon as something

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
happens,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
you start thinking

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
about it.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It is based on experience.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Unfortunately,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
it is not always

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
the case.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
The principle of temporariness

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
implies that

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
everything that you do

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
in the field of security

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
should be done

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
in advance.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
There is a saying

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
that it is too late

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
to drink borscht

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
when the kidneys fall off.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Unfortunately,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
it is not always the case.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The next principle

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I would like to point out

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
is the principle of temporariness.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The principle of temporariness

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
implies that

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
everything that you do

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
in the field of security

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
should be done

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
in advance.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
If we say that bodyguards

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
guard the body for 20 minutes,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and then drink

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
beer for 20 minutes,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
then we do not have to

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
guard this person.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
If this person

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
is guarded for 8 hours

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
at work,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and then he goes to the next yard

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
to take out the garbage in his slippers,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
then we do not have to

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
guard this person.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Therefore, everything that will be done

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
in the field of corporate security

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
should be done in advance.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
As a rule, the principle of temporariness

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
or the problems with the principle of temporariness

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
or the breakdown of this principle

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
are associated with a human factor.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
There is a guard

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
in the face,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
for example,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
the head of the security service.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
When this head of the security service

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
goes around, checks everything,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
the system works.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
The head of the security service

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
leaves,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
goes to a seminar,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
the system starts to malfunction.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
The principle of temporariness

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
can be violated in the time factor.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
During the day, everything works well,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
at night, when there is no one,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
everything can work badly.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It can be violated by a natural factor.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
On the street, let's say, 0 degrees,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
everything works well,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
on the street, minus 30,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
everything starts to work badly

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
and the equipment fails.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
The principle of corporative security

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
is based on this.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Everything you do should work continuously.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
There is a principle of activity.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I will not dwell on it.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
There is a famous saying

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
that the best defense

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
is an attack.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Therefore,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
it is about

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
everything you do

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
in the case of corporate security,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
it should be done actively.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
The principle of systematic plannedness

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
says that you should create

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
a system.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
There should not be

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
individual elements of corporate security,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
but a system of corporate security.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Everything that is done

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
in the line of corporate security

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
should be done in a certain way.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
There is a very relevant

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
and problematic principle

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
related to the principle of purposefulness.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
The principle of purposefulness

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
assumes that

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
the money you invest

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
in the system of corporate security

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
will not allow you

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
to make a profit.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
The management of the company

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
understands this very clearly.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You have a profit.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
If you invest

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
in the development of the production,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
it will allow you to make a profit.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
If you invest

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
in security,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
you will not make a profit.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You can only get protection

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
from losses.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Therefore,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
losses that can be made

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
if you do not spend

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
money on security are always considered.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
When the question arises

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
how much money to spend on security,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
it is always based on losses.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
If the loss is equal to 100 rubles,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
it makes no sense to spend

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
1000 rubles on security.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
This is often the case.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I gave an example

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
of a store.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You can reduce the theft

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
to a very small amount,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
but the money you invest

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
in the development of the equipment

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
will be economically ineffective.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The losses will be much less

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
than the money you will spend

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
on the technical equipment

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
of the store.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
There is a principle

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
that is widely used in security.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
This is the duplication principle.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
The duplication principle.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Let's recall an old joke.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Then it turned into a plot from Yarolash.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
When a little boy

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
was asked to buy two tickets,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
his grandmother asked him

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
why he was buying two tickets.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
He said that he would go to the controller

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and lose one ticket.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
He would have a second ticket.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The grandmother asked him

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
if he would lose a second ticket.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
He replied that he had a production ticket.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It is right to understand

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
that some critical things

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
must be duplicated.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
This makes the system expensive.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
The system with duplicated subsystems

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
is more expensive,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
but in some critical

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
important things

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
it justifies it.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
If we take a space industry,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
there is duplication

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
up to 5-7 times.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Up to 5-7 blocks

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
can take on functions

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
of some other blocks.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Just because it is space,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
you can't send

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
a block or a part there.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
The duplication principle

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
is widely applied

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
in corporate security.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
For example, in IT security

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
it is necessary to duplicate

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
information resources,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
create backups, etc.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
In the technical direction

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
it is also widely applied.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
For example, the communication system,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
the main reserve channel,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
some fire safety sensors,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
the main one for smoke and heat,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
it is widely applied.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
We often face

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
the question of

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
duplication of information resources.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It is clear that

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
if there is a fire,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
all information resources are destroyed,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
then the company faces

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
a big problem

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
if there is no duplication system.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
There are different algorithms.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It can be a remote server

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
or a bank cell,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
or some other options.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The main thing is

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
that the duplicated information resources

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
are not near the main server.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
If there is a fire,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
it destroys

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
the main information resources.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
The duplication principle

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
is widely applied

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
in all aspects

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
of corporate security.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
The specialization principle

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
is quite simple.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
You can do some things

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
in the corporate security

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
by yourself,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
by reading books,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
by attending seminars.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Some aspects

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
of corporate security

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
should be trusted

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
to the specialists,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to the narrow specialists

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
of your field.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
The specialization principle

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
is about

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
IT security.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I have already mentioned it.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
There should be a specialist

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
who is working on it every day.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You can search

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
for industrial espionage equipment

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
in your office

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
by yourself

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
by buying some non-linear locators.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I would not recommend

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
doing it

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
because the equipment

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
is quite expensive.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You can search

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
for industrial espionage equipment

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
by yourself.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
You can work on it

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
by yourself.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You can buy

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
some equipment

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
by yourself.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It is better to use

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
the services of the specialists

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
in these things.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
However, some things

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
can be done by yourself

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
in the corporate security.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
There is a concept

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
of interaction and coordination.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
This is the principle.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Interaction

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and coordination.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
First of all,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
this principle

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
applies to the security services.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
The security services

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
should coordinate

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
their activities.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It is related to the interaction

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
of the security services

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
with the security services

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
of the police.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
They have to

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
interact with each other.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
There is a certain

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
relationship

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
between the security services

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
and the internal affairs.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
This principle

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
applies

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
to the interaction

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
of the security services

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
and other companies.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
This is the principle

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
of interaction and coordination.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
There is another interesting principle.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I will talk about it.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
It is the principle of improvement.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Improvement.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
What does

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
this principle say?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
The corporate security system

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that you have created

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
should be checked

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
from the point of view

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
of improvement.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
First of all,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
it applies to two aspects.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The first one is

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
the technical aspects.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Technical issues.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The second one is

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
the threats.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
The technical issues.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
You can equip

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
your office, your department,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
your company

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
with the latest technology

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
in the field of corporate security.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
In a year or a year and a half,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
you will find out

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
that all this has become

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
hopelessly outdated

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
and you need to change it.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
The technology is moving

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
very fast.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
There was analog television,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
now there is digital.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
There was one resolution,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
now there is another.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
The technical means of attack

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
and the security of IT

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
are changing very fast.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Something new happens

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
almost every day.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Every month,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
new products are released.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
The principle of improvement

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
is checked from the point of view

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
of technical issues.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It also needs to be prepared

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
by the management.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Not every manager understands

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
why he has to spend money

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
on technical reequipment.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It happens very fast.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And the improvement

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
is from the point of view of threats.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
As I said,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
the protection is built

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
on the basis of real threats.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The threats can change.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The corporate security system

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
needs to be improved

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
from the point of view of the threats.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
For example,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
to make it clear,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
a control-missile regime

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
is created in the company.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
The threat is determined

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
by the threat.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
What kind of threat?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It can be a threat

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
from a hooligan

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
or a drunk person

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
who wants to enter the facility.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It is clear.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The protection system

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
is built on the basis of these threats.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
If the threats are different,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
for example,

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
you defend yourself

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
from a terrorist

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
and you have to build

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
a completely different control-missile regime.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Because the first option

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
will not be effective.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
The improvement from the point of view of threats

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
is not necessarily

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
an increase in the system.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It can be a certain weakening of the system.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
If the threats are gone,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
there is no point in spending a lot of money

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
on security.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
The improvement from the point of view of threats

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
can be a weakening of the system.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
There is a principle

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
that is also quite interesting.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It is the centralization of the control.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
The principle of centralization

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
of the control.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
What does it mean?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
The system of corporate security

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
should be subordinate to someone

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
and close to someone.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
The strict rule and strict requirement

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
is the subordination

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
of the security department

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
to the first person of the company.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
It can be the general director,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
the owner of the company,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
or someone else.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
But in no case is security

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
subordinated to top managers,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
to other departments

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
or not to the first person of the company.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
The difficult question

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
arises when

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
the owner of the company,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
the owner of the company,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
the owner of the company

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
and the general director

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
are different people.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Who should the security department

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
close to?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
There are no ready-made final decisions here,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
because the question is quite slippery.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
In the vast majority of cases,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
the security department's chief

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
subordinates to the company's owner

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
in strategic matters,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and the general director

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
in current matters.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Why is there such a division?

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Because the company's owner

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
can set tasks for the security department

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
in relation to certain control

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
or certain actions

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
in relation to the general director.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
For example,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
the general director

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
is also a hired person.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Although the question is very slippery,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
it is solved in different ways.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
There are no ready-made solutions here.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
There are several principles

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
related to the human factor.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
The principle of minimizing

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
the use of the human factor.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Minimizing

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
the use

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
of

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
the human factor.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
From the point of view of security,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I have already said that the weakest link

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
is the human factor.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Therefore, as soon as the security system

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
is strongly tied to the human factor,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
it is always bad.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Therefore, they try to make

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
the system not tied to the human factor.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
This is also related to the leadership

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
of the security service.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
The system should not be tied

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
to a specific head of the security service.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
This is related to some technical solutions,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
to some other solutions,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
so that as few questions as possible

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
are closed on the human factor.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
The technique is clear,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
predictable,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
logical,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
and predictable.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
A person is usually not logical,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
unpredictable,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
and unpredictable.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
There are also many ways

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
to influence a person.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Therefore, everything that is tied

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
to the human factor is the weakest link.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
There is a very interesting principle.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
There is such a concept as the golden section of security.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
The golden section of security.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
What is it?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Usually, it is drawn in the form of a triangle,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
where there are such parameters as

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
price,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
speed,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and security in the corners.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
When these three parameters are analyzed,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
it is necessary to assume that

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
you will not be able to choose

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
all three parameters at the same time.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Usually, they choose

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
some two priority parameters.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
You can make the system safe

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
and make it cheap,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
but it will take a long time to create.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You can make the system safe,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
you can make the system fast,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
but it will be very expensive.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
You can make the system fast,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
but it will be very expensive.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
You can make the system cheap,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
you can make it fast,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
but it will be unsafe.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Therefore, initially,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
when this system of corporate security is created,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
they try to determine

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
these three parameters.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Somewhere, let's say,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
some priority parameters are chosen.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Two priority parameters

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
are chosen from these three.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Here, this golden section

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
is, of course,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
individual for each company.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
That is, for each company

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
some two priority parameters are given.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
The main ones must be chosen,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
and the rest must be sacrificed.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
There are several more principles

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
that are applied.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
is also related to the human factor.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
is also related to the human factor.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
The principle of personal responsibility

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
is clear.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Here I would pay attention

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
not so much to the severity of the punishment,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
if we are talking about responsibility,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
but to the inviolability of the punishment.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
That is, people should know

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
that for committing some illegal actions

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
they are waiting for punishment.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
As a rule,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
observing the formation

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
of the corporate security system,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I can say that

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
the formation of all corporate security systems

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
is usually carried out

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
through some kind of punishment.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
That is,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
corporate security systems are created,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
and usually after that

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
there is a certain rejection

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
from the employees of the company.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Because any security

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
is a certain restriction

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
of the employee's authority,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
a certain complication

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
of their life at work, and so on.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
After that,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
people begin to be outraged,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
people begin to not fulfill

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
the requirements that the security system

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
builds.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
People are first convinced,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
then, as a rule,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
punished because the conviction

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
in most cases is inactive.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And in the future,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
the system will start working.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
That is, it goes through punishment.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
In relation to personal responsibility,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
such demonstrative events are widely used,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
starting with public punishments,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
ending with public,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
so to speak,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
attraction to responsibility,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
including criminal responsibility,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
and the consequences associated

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
with this.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That is,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
when people understand

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
that for, say,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
violation of some rules,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
for committing an action

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
that falls under the Criminal Code,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
the court can bring to justice,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
this is a fairly effective thing.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Then, as a rule,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
people behave very calmly and quietly.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
The next point

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
is

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
the principle of restriction of authority.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
The principle of restriction of authority.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I have already mentioned

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
the principle of restriction of authority.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
In the classical version,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
people should have access

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
only to the information

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
they need

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
to perform their work,

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
and should have

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
small powers,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
and there should be maximum control.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
The problem is mainly when

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
the powers are maximum,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
and the control is minimal.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
When the system is built

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
to the maximum,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
the problem does not arise.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
There are a few more principles

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
that are quite important.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
The principle of multilaterality.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
What does this principle say?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
It says that

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
any security system

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
does not guarantee

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
100% security.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Any security line

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
can be overcome.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It's just about time,

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
money, expediency, etc.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
The more security lines there are,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
the more reliable

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
the system is.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
For example,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
the security line

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
is used in security events.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
If you have a separate room

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
and you need to provide

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
security for this room

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
in some building,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
then here you can

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
create only one security line.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
There are bars,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
metal doors on the windows,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
a man with a gun,

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
and so on.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
If you have a separate mansion

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
with adjacent territory,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
security events

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
are usually built

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
according to the ring principle.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
There is a perimeter

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
that guards the dogs,

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
sensors,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
alarm systems, etc.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
There is a second security line,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
for example,

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
a building with metal doors,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
bars, etc.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
There is a third security line,

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
which is the security of the floor.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
The fourth security line

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
is the security of the room.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
It is a classic multi-border

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
security principle.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
In IT security,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
the multi-border principle

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
is widely used.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
For example,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
you need to enter a password

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
to enter a computer,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
to enter an information system,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
you need to show

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
some electronic identifiers,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
to enter a particularly

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
classified file,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
to make your fingerprint,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
or an iris of the eye,

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
or something else.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
This is also a classic multi-border

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
security principle.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
There is a principle

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
that is often violated,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
it is the principle of equality.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
The principle of equality

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
says that the system

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
of security

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
is determined

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
by the strength

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
of the least protected element.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
If you have 10 windows

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
in a simplified version,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
you put a very powerful

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
grill on 9 windows,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
and on the 10th window

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
there is no grill at all,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
then the strength of these 9 grills

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
will be absolutely pointless

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and useless, because the criminal

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
will climb into this 10th window.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
In practice, this is very common,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
when there are very powerful

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
security peaks in this system,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
and there are some holes

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
through which the criminal

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
can easily penetrate.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Remember one of the strict

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
security rules,

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
the strength of the security system

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
is generally estimated

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
by the strength of the

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
least protected element.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
In life, you often encounter this.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
There are two more principles,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I will draw them here.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
There is a principle of psychological

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
impact on the offender.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
What is it about?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
By the way, this is a very cheap

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
implementation principle,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
you go to the store very often,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
you see a sticker,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
the object is guarded by the police,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
it is difficult to say

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
whether it is guarded or not,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
but it protects you from some

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
levels of threat.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Attention is being filmed by a hidden

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
video camera in stores,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
there are also such stickers.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
What is it?

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
These stickers pursue different

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
purposes, including a certain

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
psychological impact.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
If you put these stickers on,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
all your problems will be solved,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
at least it will protect you

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
from some levels of threat.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
At the household level,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
you often encounter this,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
you walk along the country side,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
you see a sign that

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
there is an angry dog in the yard.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
This is a psychological impact

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
on a potential offender.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
It is advisable not to overdo it,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
because sometimes,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
for example, stickers are placed

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and the alarm is set,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
and it determines the brand.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
For example, Clifford,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Alligator, and so on.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
It is pointless to talk about

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
the specific model of the alarm

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
installed on this car,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
because the attackers know

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
all these systems,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
the anti-theft system,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
and it is pointless to inform them

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
in advance what is installed there.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Nevertheless, the principle of psychological

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
impact is widely used

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
and it works very well.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You can install a video camera

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
on your object,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
so that it can be seen.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And surprisingly,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
you will find that

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
the number of people

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
who want to climb over

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
this fence will sharply decrease

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
due to the psychological impact.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Sometimes documents are made

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
in such a way

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
to apply this principle

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
to the psychological impact.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
There is a mode of commercial secrecy.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
If you want to create it,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
you need to make sure

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
that the employees take on

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
the obligation to keep

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
your commercial secrets.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
This obligation can be

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
either through a labor agreement

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
where a separate record is made,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
or through a separate agreement

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
or a separate agreement.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
A separate agreement

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
is more effective,

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
both psychologically and

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
through psychological impact.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
When a person reads

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and sees that the articles

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
of the Criminal Code,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Administrative Code,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Labor Code,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
are flashing,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
this is much more effective

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
from the psychological point of view

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
than just a simple phrase

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
in a labor agreement.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Therefore, pay attention

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
to the psychological impact

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
of the law.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
There is a principle

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
of combining

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
publicity and conspiracy.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
This is the last principle

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I will talk about.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
It is about

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
everything you do

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
in the corporate security line

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
is usually divided into

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
two large groups.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
The first is

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
an open event,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
that is, you do not hide

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
what is happening.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
The second is a hidden event.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Hiding everything

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
that is done in the corporate security line

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
is unrealistic,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
it is pointless and expensive.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Therefore, everything is divided

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
into two large groups.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
In particular,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
some checks

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
that are carried out in companies

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
are usually divided into two groups.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
These are open checks

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
and hidden checks.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
There are planned checks,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
check of the confidential

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
business of production,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
everyone can know that

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
a check will come.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
There are unplanned checks,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
but they are not determined.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Unplanned checks

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
are like a sword

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
that hangs over a person

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
and he knows that

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
some of the things

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
he has to do

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
can always be checked

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
in the security line.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Unplanned checks

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
usually show the true

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
position of the case.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Planned checks are more

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
from the point of view

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
of the organization,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
and unplanned checks are more

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
from the point of view of real control.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
These are the principles.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
What do you think about the

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
construction of a corporate security system?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
What do you think about the

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
construction of a corporate security system?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I would like to finish

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
the first topic

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
about the construction

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
of a corporate security system.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I would like to

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
pay attention to

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
the following points.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
The security system

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
is effective

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
when a pyramid is built.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I mean a barricade.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
On the one hand,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
there is a personnel,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
security service workers,

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
management of the company.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
On the other hand,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
there are potential

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
violations of the barricade.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
When there is a barricade,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
the system is built effectively.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
In practice,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
such a rigid barricade

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
does not usually arise.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
There is usually

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
some incomprehensible figure,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
where the personnel is on one side,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
the security service is on the other side,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
the management of the company

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
is on the third side,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
and the potential violator

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
is generally unknown.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
There should always be

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
some ideal that you need to strive for.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
This ideal is precisely

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
the barricade I am talking about.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
The second point

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
that you will face

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
and usually face

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
when building a corporate security system

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
is

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
how to assess

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
the effectiveness

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
of corporate security.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
What is it about?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
It is about

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
professionally competent

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
work of the security service

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
and the fact

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
that it is not visible.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
All the problems

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
that arise

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
are solved at the stage of birth.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Therefore,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
nothing happens around the company.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
But when nothing happens,

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
the question arises

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
why nothing happens.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Either because nothing happens

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
or because the security service

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
works competently.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Many managers

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
start asking

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
why they should not

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
work in the security service

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
if nothing happens.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Therefore,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
security service often has problems

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
with assessing its activity

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
and its effectiveness.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Security service often

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
conducts such demonstrations.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It is necessary to catch someone

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
and show their importance.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
But professional security service

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
does not work.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Nothing happens around.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
What is the most difficult

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
thing when building

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
a corporate security system?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
In my opinion,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
it is the analyst.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
It is necessary to create

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
an information-analytical unit

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
that will get the information

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
and analyze it.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
It is difficult to find

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
analysts in the corporate security line.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
There are not many of them.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
They are not prepared anywhere.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
It requires

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
a certain experience

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
and an analytical mind.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
The result of the work

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
from the information-analytical unit

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
can be obtained only after a while.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Usually,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
after at least a few months

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
after the creation

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
of the information-analytical unit,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
you can expect some result.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Unlike security services,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
where the result

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
can happen the next day

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
or an hour

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
after the security service was established.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
You will face this problem.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
There is a concept

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
of work on demonstration events

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
and work on the result.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
What I want to say

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
is that

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
sometimes security is a fashion.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
You often face it.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
It is a fashion

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
and a fashion type of activity.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
It is a fashion

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and a fashion type of activity.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Security services

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
build their work

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
not from the point of view of efficiency,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
but from the point of view of certain fashion directions.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
When you see

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
bodyguards

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
driving in a car

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and in front of them

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
a bodyguard

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
is driving in an open convertible

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
in Moscow,

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
stopping at every traffic light,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
from the point of view of human protection,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
it is pointless.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
But it is a demonstration event.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
A person likes

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
a car with a bodyguard.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Although

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
it cannot be effective

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
because

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
there is no real protection.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
A lot of

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
security

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
is created

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
from a certain

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
how to say

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
from a certain image.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
A competitor has

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
a bodyguard

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
and a company manager

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
creates security

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
and a company manager

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
creates security

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
from the point of view

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
that a competitor has it,

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
so it should be mine.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Look from this point of view

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
how you need to create a security unit

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
and how it will work

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
from the point of view of efficiency

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
or from the point of view

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
of efficiency.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I would like to emphasize

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
that all the questions

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
that you will solve

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
in the line of corporate security

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
should be divided into two big groups.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The one where it is clear what needs to be done

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
and the one where it is not clear what needs to be done.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
The one where it is clear what needs to be done

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I would say

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
is mainly technical issues.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
You need to install

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
a video surveillance system.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
In general, it is clear what needs to be done.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
You need to look at

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
what cameras,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
choose a company

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
that will install it,

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
serve it, and so on.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
You need to allocate money for it.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
There are problems where it is not clear what needs to be done.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
As a rule, it is a relationship

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
with the controlling law enforcement agencies,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
it is business intelligence,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
it is personnel security.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
And here,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
at those moments

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
when it is not clear what needs to be done,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
the law enforcement agencies pay more attention to it.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I think that is all

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
about our first topic

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
on building corporate security systems.
