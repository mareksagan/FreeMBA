00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
What are the main methods of selling?

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, now we will look at the sales stimulation.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Probably the biggest and most basic block,

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
because today we found out that the BTL methods,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
the methods of selling, are more and more active,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
more active in the market,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
bring more and more results,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
because the situation in the market is developing in this way.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's see what are the main methods of selling stimulation.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
Here is a chain of goods from the manufacturer to the buyer.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And there we see several links.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
After the manufacturer, we have a distributor,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
if it is not there, maybe there is a dealer,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
and the next is the wholesale,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
and the next is the trading link,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
which brings our goods to the buyer.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
So, the best way to stimulate the sales

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
is to do it in a complex way,

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
starting from the manufacturer,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
starting from the company itself,

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
and ending with the company that offers your goods to the market,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
that is, with the trading point.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
If you have at least one link,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
especially when it comes to the export of new goods to the market,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
then the whole company may not have the proper effect

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
or fail,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
because by stimulating one or two of the chains,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
our chain is not like that, it breaks.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
When it breaks,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
some of the companies that present our goods to the market are not motivated.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Since there is no motivation for sales,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
they just don't do it,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
or they don't do it the way we would like.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Spending certain funds, we don't get the result,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
because there is no complex impact on the market.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
What are the main methods of stimulation?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
The first is the trade marketing programs,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
which are aimed at the trading link.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
The dealer, distributors, wholesale,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
and retail trading networks or shops that offer products to the market

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
are related to the trading link.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
The second is direct marketing,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
which we will definitely talk about today.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
These are merchandising events that are held at trading points.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
They are also related to the stimulation of sales.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
A competent merchandising allows you to increase sales from 80% to 300%.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
This is a very large resource in the hands of the company.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
And, of course, another method is consumer promotion.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
This is an event aimed at the end consumer,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
because it simply stimulates the trading link.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
We provide you with products on shelves,

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
but we will not encourage our customer to buy our product.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Therefore, of course, with a complex impact and the impact of the end consumer,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
it is just as important and necessary.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Let's first consider the goals.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
The main goals that promote sales.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
The first goal or group of goals,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
the most important is, of course, increasing sales volumes

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
or accelerating the product turnover of the company.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
This group has a list of certain goals,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
which is presented on the slide and in your workbooks.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
What goals can be achieved by stimulating this group?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Let's see.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Of course, the first is the import of a new product to the market.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
This is the main goal, if you import a new product.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
The second is, of course, the sale of the product,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
for example, in connection with the end of the season

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
or with the expiring expiration date.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
We can also set such a goal here.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Naturally, this is an acceleration of the purchase,

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
that is, a more frequent purchase of a particular product

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
or increasing the volume.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Previously, we bought a certain amount,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
now we want to buy twice as much, for example.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Remember, for example, shampoo.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
Previously, it was said that shampoo was intended only to wash the head,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
for example, once or twice a week.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Now we see that the bottle says

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
that shampoo is intended for daily use.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
This is just an increase in the volume of purchases.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
That is, we buy shampoo now much more than before.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
This is how you can give an example with any product.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Okay, the next group of goals that we will consider.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
The next group of goals is the implementation of the pyramid of communication.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What is the pyramid of communication?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
When we see a product, we go through several stages.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
The first is awareness.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
We just find out about this product, that there is such a product.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
But we don't know what kind of product it is yet.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
The next stage is information.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
When we study more deeply the information about this product

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and find out how it can be used, why, for what, and so on.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
The next is the attitude to the brand.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
We have already looked at what kind of product it is,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
and we develop our attitude, positive or negative.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
After that, we only make a decision about the purchase.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Will we buy this product or not?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
What are the goals of this group?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The first goal is, of course, getting acquainted with the company.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Because first you need to know about the company.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
The next goal is getting acquainted with the product,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
which we can put to a certain number of consumers.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
One of the goals can be the purchase.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Sometimes it is very important when we introduce a new product to the market.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
First, our buyers should try this product,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
and then understand whether they need it or not in the future

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
in order to make a second purchase.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Of course, deepening knowledge about the product can also be a goal,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
when we tell about its properties in addition.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
And, of course, increasing the number of visitors to a particular point of sale can also be a goal.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
The goals that are described here can be used

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
when planning events for stimulation,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
only by adding numbers and deadlines.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
These are ready-made goals that will help you define what you want in this market.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And now we will look at two more groups of goals.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
The next group of goals is product positioning and positioning.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
This group of goals is used when we plan to introduce a new brand

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
and make a future brand out of it.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Then, of course, it is important for us to know how we will position our product,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
what the buyers will think about it,

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
whether they will confirm the positioning that we offer them for this product.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
What goals can be here?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Of course, attracting customers to a certain segment,

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
because we do positioning for each segment separately.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Remember, we said that each segment presents its own requirements for the product.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
Based on these requirements, we determine the positioning of the product.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The next point is, of course,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
the image of the product in the consumer's mind.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
This is how various support actions are held

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
to remind our product,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
to remind our image,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
to remind our slogan,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
to remind our product idea,

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
so that the buyers have the so-called knowledge without a clue.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
For example, you are asked,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
what beer brands do you like?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And you call those brands without a clue,

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
which are produced by the company that conducts this survey.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Thus, this is knowledge without a clue.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
This is what all manufacturers want to achieve,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
because it is the main key to success.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
You are known, and, accordingly, some part of it is bought.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And another group of goals that we will consider

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
is the preservation and increase of market share.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
At least two goals can be set in this subgroup.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
The first is to preserve market share.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Usually, this goal is set in the high season,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
because all companies hold shares,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and we need to keep at least our share,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
or maybe increase it,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
and take away from the competitor part of our buyers.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
And another goal is to switch buyers from the competitor's trading brand

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
to our trading brand.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
This needs to be done very carefully,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
but nevertheless, many companies do this,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
and many achieve success.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Well, we have considered the main groups of goals,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
and you can use them, as I said,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
by setting numbers and deadlines.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
And now let's look at the main tools

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
for stimulating the sale or the main tools of trade marketing.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
We will start with the consideration of the tools

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
for stimulating the sale.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The first is, of course, the discounts,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
various discounts and various bonuses

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
that we offer to our customers.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Discounts can be both volumetric, seasonal, and holiday,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
and for a comprehensive purchase,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and for encouraging the sale of a new product,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
whatever we do

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
to make our customer interested in working with us.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But there are also bonuses.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Bonuses often work even better than discounts,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
because a bonus is a certain bonus

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
for completing a task.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And by setting a correct task,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
we get a very effective result.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
What are the bonuses?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
We can offer bonuses for increasing the distribution,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
for selling a certain top assortment,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
for fulfilling a set plan,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
which, of course, needs to be pursued.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It can be a team bonus,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
which is given for, for example,

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
a group or a specific plan to your client,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
which will encourage the activity of all employees,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
all team members.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Actually, bonuses are considered more effective

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
than discounts today.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Nevertheless, you can't avoid discounts.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
This is a standard tool for stimulating the sale.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Let's consider two more tools.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
These are special events and merchandising,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
which we have already talked about.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
What do special events have to do with them?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
These are specialized exhibitions,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
where companies participate most often.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Naturally, you need to prepare for them very well,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and set tasks in the same way,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
and monitor their execution.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Specialized exhibitions are not only an image moment,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
although, of course,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
you can't remove the image moment.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
The exhibition cannot give

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
a momentary increase in sales,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
but increasing the client base,

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
increasing sales or promoting a new product

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
is a must-do.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
The next special event is a presentation of a new product,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
training inside the company of your clients,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
which must be held

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
in order to maintain the information level,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
knowledge of your product,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
loyalty to the company, awareness.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
The same events are held by companies in a mandatory order.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
These are also various professional conferences,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
press conferences,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
various trainings, seminars,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
which are dedicated to your product

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
or are connected with your product.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
The next tool is merchandising,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
which, as I said,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
allows you to increase sales from 80% to 300%.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
This is only in my practice.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Maybe someone had higher numbers.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Nevertheless, what does merchandising allow you to do?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
It allows you to carry out a competent product layout,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
to present POS materials,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
which will inform the client

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
about the events,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
discounts, bonuses,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
information about the new product.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
These are various lottery competitions

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
held at the place of sale,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
at the trading point.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
This is advertising at the place of sale,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
which will also help to draw attention

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
to your product.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
These are sales consultants,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
who certainly increase sales

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
of your product several times

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
if they work competently and professionally.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
We will talk about this later.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Let's consider the main objects

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
of the impact of trade marketing programs.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Who do we influence and who do we work for?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Here is the whole chain.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
As I said, the first in this chain

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
is, of course, your own staff.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
You need to start with him.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Especially if you introduce a new product,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
focus on this.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Not a single trading staff of the company,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
even if he is very loyal to the management of the company,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
will not be pleased with the appearance of a new product.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Because it is difficult to sell it,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
and you should pay special attention to this.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
If you introduce a new product to the market,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
the first person to be motivated

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
is your own trading staff.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Yes, they get a bonus or a percentage

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
of the sales volume they have made.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
But this is not all.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
One thing is to sell a well-known product,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
which does not require any special effort

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
to pay for its own cost.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
The buyers themselves ask for it,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
they buy it, and our sales managers

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
will successfully implement the product

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
that they sell themselves

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and will not pay attention

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
to your new product.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
This is a problem from the point of view

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
that it should be presented correctly,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
positioned correctly,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
and the competitors should tell

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
about the competitive advantages of the new product.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Otherwise, how can you convince a buyer

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
to take it and try it?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
After all, the buyer also has a risk.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
He invests funds that are not known

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
whether they will return quickly.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And fast turnover is one of the tasks

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
of any buyer.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Therefore, by putting all links of your chain

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
at risk,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
when you introduce a new product,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
we must take into account

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
that our sales managers

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
will play a key role here.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And when you introduce a new product,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
you must start working with them.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Then, when your product

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
is already in the stable line,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
it is not necessary to do this.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Sometimes you can hold

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
supportive events

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
in the form of contests,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
various bonuses,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
in order to remind

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
what needs to be done.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
But you will not need

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
constant stimulation.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
It is only necessary at the very first stage.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
The next person

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
who enters this chain

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
is a branch network or a distributor,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
depending on what your company has.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Maybe you have branches,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
maybe not, but in any case

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
there are intermediaries

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
who must be stimulated in the same way.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Because the same law works here.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
What is already known

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
or is already sold well.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Therefore,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
in order to reduce risks,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
we give discounts, bonuses,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
we come up with various programs.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And this is justified.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Why do those companies

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
that work in the market

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
and are not holders of the brand

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
have to bear certain risks?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
We must pay for these risks.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Because we are the initiators

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
of a particular process,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
a particular product

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
and a particular product.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
The entire trading chain,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
which is indicated here on the slide,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
must be thought out

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
throughout the chain

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
for the stimulation of sales.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Otherwise, as I said,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
when any of these links fall out,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
you will not achieve a comprehensive result.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And there will be no synergy

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
from your actions.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Let's look at the main methods of stimulation.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
They are divided into two main groups.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
These are price methods and non-price methods.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
The first one we will consider

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
is the price method.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And the first of the price methods

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
is our favorite seasonal discount,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
which we give.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Almost any company does this.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
As I said,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
in the high season,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
the discount is additional

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
in order to capture or retain

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
its share of the market.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And in the low season,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
when there is practically no sale

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
or it is sharply reduced,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
the discount is used quite often.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
The next discount is the holiday discount,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
which is also particularly popular.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Our clients, our consumers

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
are waiting for seasonal discounts.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Remember the New Year's sales.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Yes, we give discounts,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
but what is the turnover we get?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
After all, according to the statistics,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
sales in the New Year increase by 250%

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
compared to the average sales volume

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
per month.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Therefore, such a discount is justified.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
We earn due to the turnover.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
If your product has a certain shelf life,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
if it has a seasonal direction,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
of course, a discount allows us

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
to keep a balance

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
on the stock of our products.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
The next discount is

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
a loss leader.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
What is this discount?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Remember such things.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You are driving along the highway

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
and suddenly there is an advertisement

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
and it is written

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
that there is a crossroad

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
in the shopping network

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
and today a watermelon

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
costs 3 rubles per kilogram.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And you think,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
how great, if a watermelon

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
costs so cheaply,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
then everything else is probably

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
also at a similar price.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And so we get hooked.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
This discount is called

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
or this program is called a loss leader.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
When we take the product

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
and the leader in sales,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
in turnover,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
the most popular in this period,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
we set the price to cost,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and earn on other products,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
because we set higher prices

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
on other products.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
This is a very well-working method

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
and almost all buyers

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
come across it.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
The next discount is

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
a discrimination discount.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
What is this discount?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Remember when you come to the museum

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and what you see there.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Children are free,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
citizens of the Russian Federation

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
are free,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
and the rest are free.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Here is a discrimination discount.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
When you set the price

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
for the same product

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
for different categories of consumers,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
such a system

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
works not only in museums.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Now it is very active,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
for example, in the services

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
of air transport,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
when, for example, young people

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
under 25 years old

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
are given a discount on a ticket

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
and you can buy

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
two tickets back and forth

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
for the price of one.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
These are very good programs

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
that work great

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and are very active abroad.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
The next discount is

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
a discount for a large volume.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
This discount is also standard,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
as well as seasonal,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
and is used by almost all companies

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
that work in the market.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
When we set certain turnover

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
and thus stimulate

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
the sale of a product,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
the discount is standard,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
is used often,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
and works in one way or another.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
The next discount is a discount on time.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Remember, in stores,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
a happy hour,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
or, for example,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
from the 1st to the 15th,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
there will be such a discount,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and from the 15th to the 30th

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
there will be less discount.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Thus, you are encouraged

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
to buy a particular product

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Distributor companies

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
use such a discount

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
before New Year's sales.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
They usually say

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
that in November there will be a discount

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
to unload supplies,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
to unload their logistics,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
so that, for example,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
most companies buy in November,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and not in December.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
This is how you can use this discount.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
The next discount is discount or gift cards.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, probably,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
many of us now have different cards,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
discount cards, gift cards,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
in any store it already works,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
in some even the loyalty program works,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
but this is more

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
not related to the price method,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
but there is still a discount for the price,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
most often it is a deposit,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
and we use it one way or another.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
This makes us return

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
to certain stores,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
which means it works.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
But one more point is the sale of loans.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
This is a very developing area,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
there are a lot of consumer loans now,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
and it is even difficult to name a product

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
that is not being sold on credit.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Almost everything.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
As long as you are credit-capable,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
as long as you have a good credit history,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
if you have it,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
and as long as you are ready to buy on credit.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And so, please,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
this is a very good method

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
to stimulate the sale of your product.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
For example, you sell some equipment,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
of course, you will immediately increase sales

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
if a person makes an offer.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You don't need to buy a car,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
you don't need to buy a car,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
you just need to buy a product,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
and you will pay later.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
This is very good for our customers.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And now let's look at the main

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
non-price methods.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
They are just as popular

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
as the price ones,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
but have a slightly different nature.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We are not playing at the price,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
but playing at various gifts, bonuses,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
and so on. Let's see.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
The first method is credit cards.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, it's not a discount.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Here's an example.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
You come to a store

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
where men's underpants are sold.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You buy one or two of them,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
and you are given virtual money

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
with the amount written on it.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
For example, 200, 300, 500 rubles.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And you are told

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
that the next time you buy

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
another pair of underpants,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
you can use this card

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
as a credit.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
That is, this amount will be taken

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
as internal money of the client.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
This is the same method that makes

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
the client come back.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Free samples or sampling

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
work very well

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
when new goods are brought to the market.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
When you offer your products

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
to try in small versions,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
in miniatures,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
samples are given

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
or free samples that the client

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
tries and decides for himself

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
whether this product is interesting

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
or not. In fact, free samples

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
can be applied to the experience link.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
When we give a free product

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
or a so-called free product,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
free in quotes,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
from money.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That is, if the program

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
can be made such that

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
if a company buys a certain amount

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
of product,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
then so many free samples are attached to it.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
This works very well

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
because it allows the first company

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
to try the product itself.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
The second

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
is the ability to sell this product.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And the third

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
is to give it to someone,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
to win loyalty.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
There are many

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
ways to use this product.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And it works very well

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
for both end users

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and for the trading link.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I highly recommend it.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The next

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
method is gifts.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That is, you give a certain

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
gift to a certain product,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
a necessary thing for the client.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
The word necessary is key.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Because if this gift is not necessary,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
for example, you may remember

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
that a year or two ago there was an advertisement

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
about buying an apartment and a cap as a gift.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It was funny,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
but nevertheless everyone remembered.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
However, the gift was completely useless.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So it is here.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Please, evaluate

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
what kind of gift you have.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Will it be useful?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And one more thing.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
The cost of the gift should not exceed

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
more than 30% of the product's cost.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Otherwise, your customers

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
will ask

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
why such expensive gifts

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
are given.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
We all understand that these are costs.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Therefore, be careful with the amount of the gift.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The gift should not be more expensive

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
than the product itself.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
The next method is bonuses,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
which we give for the fulfillment of a particular bonus.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
For example, your distributor

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
sold a certain

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
number of goods

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
and got a certain number of new customers

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
that you planned for him.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You can pay him a bonus

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
for this,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
for which he will be very grateful to you.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And then he will continue

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
to work with you as a partner.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The bonus can be

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
not only money,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
it can be various gifts,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
for example,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
trips,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
or some

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
interesting things.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
These are the things

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
that will be interesting to the customer.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
For example, I can give you

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
an example of a wine company

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
that held a competition

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
among

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Argentine wine.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It was three years ago,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
but the competition was very interesting

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
and inexpensive.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
They held a competition

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
for the best wholesalers

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
that would sell

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
the most products.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And the number of winners

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
was not one, not two,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
but as many as 15.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
The winning companies

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
were offered

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
to go, for example,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
to a trip

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
to a competition

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
in Formula 1,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
or to the World Cup,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
or to the Brazilian Carnival.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Try to find such ideas

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
that will be interesting to the customer.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Not just a trip to Turkey,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
but something interesting,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
where you will not

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
gather often.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Such non-standard offers

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
make you participate

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
in such competitions

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
and such games

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
and fight for such prizes.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
The next point

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
is the increased warranty period.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
One of the methods

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
when you say

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
that you have an increased

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
warranty for a product

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
is to be careful

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and not to spoil yourself.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
The product must be of high quality

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
and meet the requirements.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
If you are returned

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
a mass product,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
you will not cope

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
with such a flow.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Although it works

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
great for the customer.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
The next method is the lottery.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It is also a good method

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
because it is inexpensive.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Imagine,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
your customers

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
win only one, two or three times.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Of course, the costs are small,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and there are many participants.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
But the lottery has

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
one feature.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
It must be registered

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
in the state bodies.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
If the gift amount

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
is more than 3,000,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
your customer will have to pay taxes.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Therefore, be careful

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
and pay fines

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
if it is used improperly.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Another method is

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
club participation.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
There are many clubs now.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
There are clubs of different interests,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
clubs of the same brand,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
clubs of football fans,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
clubs of famous personalities.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
You can work

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
with all these clubs

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
to promote the product.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
The second method

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
is to create your own club

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
where your customers

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
will be interested.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Internet shops

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
have announced

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
reading clubs.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
They give discounts

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
and it is interesting for people.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Not everyone can join.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
The exclusivity of the club

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
is determined by the fact

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
that not everyone can join.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Only a person or a company

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
is determined

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
by special criteria

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
that you will determine.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Club membership

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
should be interesting and exclusive.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Otherwise, it will be

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
not a club,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
but a gathering of people.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
It will not be interesting.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Another method is

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
to attract a friend.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Many companies

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
offer discount cards

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
for friends.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It is great

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
because we increase

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
the number of potential clients.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
It is nice to give a discount card

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
to a friend who has not

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
participated in a promotion.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
It will encourage him

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
to participate in a promotion

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and buy a product.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
If you have such an opportunity,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I recommend you to use it.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
We have discussed

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
the main methods of stimulation.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
But since there are so many of them,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
how to choose the right one?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
What should we pay attention to?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
In your lecture material

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
there is an algorithm

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
that will help you

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
quickly decide

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
what you need.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I want to draw your attention

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
to the following algorithm.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
All methods of stimulation

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
are divided into two groups.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
They are called

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
continuous and selective stimulation.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Continuous stimulation

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
is when we stimulate all our clients

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
and buyers.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
For example,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
everyone who

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
buys something

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
this week will get

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
a discount.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Selective stimulation

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
is when we stimulate

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
not everyone.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
For example, every 10th client will get a discount

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
or a competition.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
In the competition, several people win.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
This is also a selective method.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
What are the main differences?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Selective stimulation gives a very good

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
optimization of expenses and budget.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You do not need to stimulate everyone

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
and optimize your expenses.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
In the absence of money

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
such a strategy

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
is very beneficial

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and interesting.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
It allows you to maintain

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
the interest in the product

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
and does not make you spend a lot of money.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Then you will follow the algorithm

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
and the arrows.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Everything is clear there.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
As a result,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
you will have a choice

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
not of 15 methods of stimulation

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
but of 3-4.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
According to the budget,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
you can choose one method

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
and move on.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
You can develop mechanics

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
and a program of stimulation.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
What are the main tools?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I would like to talk to you

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
and focus on the most effective

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
from a practical point of view.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Discounts for volume

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
are the most popular

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
among our intermediaries.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Discounts allow them to earn

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
and the main goal of intermediaries

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
is to earn money,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
not to sell or promote

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
a new product to the market.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Earning money is their main goal.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Discounts allow them to do this.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Therefore,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
discounts are the most popular

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and the most basic method.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Another method

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
that concerns finances

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
is the delay of payment

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
or payment conditions.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Each company has different

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
financial practices.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
However,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
you can credit the client

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
by delaying payment

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
which is also a financial method

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
of stimulating sales.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
You need to invest money

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
now or later.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It is an important point

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
for each company

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
as well as in the case

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
of the credit system.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Bonuses for fulfilling

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
the established plan.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
The only thing you need

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
is a clear and feasible plan.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
If you make an unfulfilled plan,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
your bonuses will not work.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
You will save money

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and you will not get the results

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
you want.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The next method

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
is the competition between companies.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
It is a very good method

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and works well.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
However,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
you need to be clear

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
and accountable

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
about the company's performance

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
and its indicators.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Moreover,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
you need to see

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
who is in which position.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
You need to send this information

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
to each company

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
so that they can stimulate

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
their business.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
It is not enough

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
to see what the other company

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
is doing.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
You need to be more active

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
and participate in the competition.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
The next method

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
is the free product.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I have already mentioned

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
that it is a very good

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
method of stimulation,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
especially when you bring

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
a new product to the market.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It works well.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It is a loyalty

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
and an opportunity to sell

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
and to give a gift.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
If you practice

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
this method,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
it works

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
very well.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
There are two more methods

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
that we will discuss.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
The first one is the payment

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
of the shelves to the retail.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
If you work with retail companies,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
you provide the funds

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
to your intermediary

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
to pay the shelves to the retail.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
This helps him to develop

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
his business

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
and sell your products.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
It is a very good method of stimulation.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
However,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
you need to have a strict control

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
of the shelfs

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and the payment.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
The recommendation is

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
to sign a three-way contract

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
between the retail

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and the distributor

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
so that the retail

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
understands where the money

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
comes from and where the money

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
comes from.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
You pay for the representation

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
of your products on the shelves.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The second method is the presentation.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
However,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
many intermediaries refuse to learn.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
They say that they have many suppliers

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
and everyone wants to learn

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and do something.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
What should you do in this situation?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
You need to inform about the product.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
If the retail representatives

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
do not know anything about your product,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
they will not be able to sell it normally.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
The solution is the following.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You should conduct training

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
and call it not a training

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
on your product,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
but a training on the method of selling

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
based on the example of your product.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Or you can conduct training

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
on the basis of merchandising

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
based on the example of your product.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
It will be correct and good.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You will not only teach,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
but also show it

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
on your examples.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And, in fact,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
the holy of holies will allow you

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to sell your product to the retailers.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
These are the main methods

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
of stimulating intermediaries.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
We have discussed the most popular

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
and the advantages and disadvantages.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I would like to add

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
to the discounts.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
They are the most popular.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
You have a very large list of discounts

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
in your educational materials.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I have collected them

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
from different companies.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Maybe you will add it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
to the list of discounts

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
that were not there.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
But nevertheless,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
pay attention to the following.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
You can make

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
the discounts that are already

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
practiced in your company

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
stand out.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And those that are not practiced

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
are your potential.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
You can apply them from time to time.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Remember we said that in order

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
for a company not to get used to discounts,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
you need to constantly change the conditions.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Then your intermediaries

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
will not know what you will come up with tomorrow.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And they will not expect

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
the next discount,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
bonuses, and so on.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
You will constantly change the conditions.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I recommend getting acquainted with this list

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
and applying

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
certain things that are

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
very useful and

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
very effective when selling

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
products.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I would like to talk about a few more points

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
in the framework of working with intermediaries.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
There are two methods

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
that help us establish

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
a closer relationship

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
with intermediaries.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
The first one is called a rebate.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
In Russian,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
if you look at the essence of this method,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
you can say that it is a retro bonus

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
that is often not used by the company.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
What is the meaning of this?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
It is a return on the money

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
for buying a product.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
A rebate program is a return

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
on the money

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
for buying a product for a certain amount.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
For example, you say that your product

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
costs 1,000 rubles,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
but if you buy a batch of 1,000 pieces,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
we will give you a 15% discount.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
That is, we will return 150 rubles

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
from each product.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But this will only happen if you buy

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
a certain amount.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
The client says, yes, I will buy it,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
but I am not ready to do it right away,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
because it is immediate investment.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
He says, I will do it

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
within three months or a year.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But if you give him a discount in advance,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
where is the guarantee

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
that he will buy it from you?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Yes, he signed the contract,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
but this is not a guarantee that he will definitely do it.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
In the end, he will tell you,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
well, he could not, what will you do with it?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Such a rebate discount

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
or retro bonus is a guarantee

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
that he will either

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
buy this turnover

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
or you will not pay him

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
extra money.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And this discount that you will have to pay him

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
will work for you

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
for a whole year.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
That is, it will be money in the turnover of your company.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
This is also a plus.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
And, in fact, at the end of the period

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
when the client buys the entire batch

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
that he promised,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
you return this amount to him

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
without cash,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
which you promised,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
150 rubles from each product.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And this is either a retro bonus

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
or a rebate program,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
whatever you call it.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
What is interesting, in Russia,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
this is mainly applied on the trade channel,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
and in the West,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
retail stores and retail networks

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
For example,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
you buy some product,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and you get a part of the amount on your card.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
This amount as money

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
is on this card.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
You can return to this store

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
and buy something in the same store,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
but you cannot take it with money.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Thus, you are forced to return

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
to this store,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
become a more loyal, permanent client.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That's how.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
The next point I would like to talk about

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
is the so-called MDF funds.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Market Development Fund.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
What are these funds?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You agree with your intermediaries

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
literally about the following.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
If they buy a certain product

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
in a certain amount,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
you give them an additional discount,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
but you do not give them a discount

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
with money,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
you accumulate this discount

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
on your account.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
A virtual account is created

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
with the client

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
and accumulated.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
The manager of the sale

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
must monitor this account.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
What is the purpose of this money?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
To promote the product

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
on the client's territory.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
What usually happens?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Our intermediaries do not have money

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
to promote our product.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
They are not very interested in this.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
They say, promote yourself if you need to.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
We are interested in promoting the product.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
We offer an additional discount,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
accumulate the amount.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
If this amount is accumulated,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
then the intermediary can use it

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
as a marketing budget

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
to promote our product

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
on their market.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
He promotes not only our product,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
but also his company.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
In any case, he should be interested.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
According to the rules,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
you must say right away

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
that you do not pay for this with money.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Another condition that can be made.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
If a client develops

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
or comes up with a very interesting idea

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
or a good program,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
then you can add your own funds

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
to this fund

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
so that there is enough money for the implementation of this program.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I will give an example.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
In June, I participated in a conference

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
held by furniture companies.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Companies for the production of office furniture.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
One of the companies

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
practices

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
the creation of such funds.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
They introduced this practice

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
two years ago

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
and summed up the first results.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
There was a very interesting example.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
A company for the production of office chairs.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It has dealers and distributors.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
One of the distributors

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
also accumulated such a fund

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and decided to make a program

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
to promote expensive office chairs.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
They came up with a very interesting

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
and unusual idea.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Usually, a test drive is held

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
for cars.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
So, this test drive

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
was proposed to be held for chairs.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Can you imagine?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
There was a screen

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
in the car

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
where a young man

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
or a young woman sits in a chair

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and rides on it.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
There was an inscription

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Test Drive Chair.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
What did they propose?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
They proposed to order a chair

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
and try to sit on it.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
They brought a chair and left it for three days.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Of course, most often expensive chairs

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
are ordered by the management.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
The company's manager,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
having sat in a good chair

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
would not find money

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
to buy this chair.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You know, the program worked

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
absolutely perfectly.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Firstly,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
of all the chairs

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
they offered

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
for a test drive

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
for several days

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
almost 70%

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
ended up in sales.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
The result was amazing.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
This program was paid for by such an MDF fund.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
The company itself

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
did not have enough money.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
The head company, the manufacturer,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
added money

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
because the idea was very interesting

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
and it received a very good response.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Then it was copied by other companies.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
This is an example.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I recommend such funds to be created

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
but to discuss the conditions on the shore.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Dear colleagues,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I would like to discuss

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
one more point with you.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
This is the development of relations

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
with key clients

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
and the development of loyalty programs.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Loyalty programs are now

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
a talk of tongues.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Unfortunately, not many people do it.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Why do we need them?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Our clients are not only

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
our buyers.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
In fact, they are business partners.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
They help us to do our business.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
We help them to earn money.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Why not become partners?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
When a company

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
feels like a partner

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
there is less risk of losing a client,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
less chance

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
that he will leave for another company.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
That is why

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
loyalty programs

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
are so well and actively practiced.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I want to give you

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
an example of a developed

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
loyalty program

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
that we developed ourselves

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and implemented

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
within the framework of our company.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
The company operates on the elite alcohol market.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
But it doesn't matter.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
In fact,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
it is a loyalty program.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
It will be presented

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
in full in your lecture material.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You can take the main sections

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and, of course,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
adjust the content of the sections

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
to your company.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
You can leave the main sections.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Each of them is especially important

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
for working with key clients.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I will comment on the loyalty program

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
that we developed.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
The first part of the loyalty program

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
is, of course,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
financial support.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
We should not forget that

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
intermediaries earn money.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Financial support is the first thing

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
they will pay attention to.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
What do we offer them?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Of course, we offer an exclusive system

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
of discounts for each client.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
For example,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
if someone has a very expensive delivery,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
for example, a partner in Krasnoyarsk Krai,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
who needs to deliver

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
to the areas

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
with rare periods of navigation,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
we offer additional expenses.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
If we can help,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
we form an individual program

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
and offer individual discounts.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
The second point is payment

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
by entering the network.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
We understand perfectly

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
that if we need to enter

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
the network exchange,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
there is a so-called

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
entrance ticket.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Our company offers

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
help to enter

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
the network of products

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
on the condition

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
that they will agree with us.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
In the part of financial support,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
we also offer

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
advertising support,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
that is, funds for

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
various programs.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
On the condition that

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
the intermediary pays part of the funds.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
If you do everything for him,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
for the intermediary,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
it will not be a loyalty program,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
but a constant sponsorship.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
So that the intermediary

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
is active and responsible

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
for the result,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
he must also contribute

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
to this promotion.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Another point that we offer

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
in the framework of financial support

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
is the purchase of additional equipment,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
such as cabinets, refrigerators,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
and various showcases.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
This equipment

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
can be included

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
as part of the payment

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
by entering the trading point

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
or instead of the payment

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
by entering the trading point.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Here you can consider

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
various options.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
This is all about financial support.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
The next block is

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
information support.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
It is not like information

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
that we need

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
when making management decisions.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
We collect information, of course.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
We have analysts

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
who are constantly engaged in this.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
They collect information on the market,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
information from the industry press,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
reviews of sources,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
conduct various studies,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
evaluate competitors,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
consider the dynamics of the market.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
We do a lot of work.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Why can't we

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
share this with our key partners?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Of course, we can do this.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Moreover, we actually do it anyway,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
and additional services

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
will be free for us.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
We simply offer

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
a selection of this information,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
its distribution,

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
so that they can make

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
their management decisions

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
on our market

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
in the same comfortable way.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
The next group

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
in the loyalty program

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
is advertising materials.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Advertising materials

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
are usual catalogs, leaflets,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
souvenir products,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
encyclopedias of drinks

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
that we made in a multimedia version.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Everything that helps

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
to present our product

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
to our clients.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
What I would like to say here is that

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
if you pay for catalogs

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
and send them to your clients,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
think about

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
how to spend

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
your money more effectively.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
For example,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
you can embed information

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
into the catalog of your client.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I will explain why.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Imagine that a sales representative

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
goes to a sales point

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
to offer your product

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
or to your client.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
It doesn't matter.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
He has a big portfolio

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
with documents,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
his own catalog of the company,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and he has 15 more companies

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
that he sells

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and he has to carry all catalogs.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Most often he throws them away.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
He just throws them away.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
He doesn't carry them with him.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
And if he doesn't offer them,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
your product is not sold.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
That's all. The situation is simple.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
If you have separate lists

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
in your client's catalog

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and you place your product there,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
be sure that he will carry

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
this catalog with him

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and offer it.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
At least your clients will see

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
your product and will have a reason

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
to order it.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
The next part of the loyalty program

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
is offering help to our specialists.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
What do I mean?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I mean consulting,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
that is, training on goods,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
logistics,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
for example, the implementation of business processes

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
that we have already implemented in our company,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
we help to implement in the company of competitors.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We have already gone this way,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
we have seen mistakes,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
we have seen additional subtleties,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
moments that need to be taken into account.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
We can share our experience

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
with our colleagues and build

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
correct business processes

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
in their business.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
This helps a lot and makes

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
the business more profitable,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
so it is recommended to offer

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
such services as a program.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
The next part is joint actions

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and joint projects.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
What can be offered here?

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
When we feel like partners,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
when we have some joint activity

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
within the framework of these joint projects,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
we have developed a trading brand

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
in which several participants,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
several key clients,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
we developed it together,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
we promoted it together to the market.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
This united us as a group of companies

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
that bring this product to the market.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
This made us partners

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
and does not allow us to fall apart

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
under certain circumstances.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Next, this is joint participation

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
in exhibitions,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
joint participation in sponsorship projects,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
maybe even on the client's territory,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
when you yourself

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
offer him participation

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
in this sponsorship project

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
on the condition that, of course,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
the intermediary company

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
also participates there independently.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Also, as a joint action,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
you can offer a product presentation

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
for the partner's clients.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
That is, your people

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
go to the intermediary's territory,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
where a certain number of clients

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
are gathered

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and a presentation is held.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
You can hold such presentations

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
with the participation of suppliers

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
whom you attract to this activity,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
which greatly increases

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
the image of the company

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
in the eyes of the client

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
and helps him in sales,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
which is also very important.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
The next point is the training

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
that we can offer.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
We offer a list of trainings

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
that we can hold

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
at the client's company.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Naturally, we do not ask

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
for any payment for this,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
that is, this is within the framework

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
of the loyalty program.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
The next section is demo equipment,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
which we can offer them

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
as part of the demonstration.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
This includes a list of products

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
that we offer for free,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
various miniatures,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
that is, a product in a minimal version,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
souvenir products,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
the same encyclopedia of drinks

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
that I told you about,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
that is, a catalog of products

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
in a multimedia version.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Everything that will help them

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
make the presentation of your product

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
more comfortable, more popular.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
And two more points,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
two sections that we included

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
when we talked about our partners

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
on our website,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
talked about the companies

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
we work with,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
reflected the results of various contests,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
various promotions,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
the profile of our partner

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
was always posted on our website.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
This is additional advertising,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
in fact.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
And another point,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
which was also recorded in the loyalty program,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
is various contests,

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
funny, funny,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
but helping to unite

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
in interests.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
This is a contest for the best showroom,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
a contest for the best joke,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
we had a contest for the best

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
secretary of the referent,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
when we simply called the company

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and evaluated

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
how the client was met,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
how they talked to him.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
A lot of employees participated.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
This is a contest for a children's drawing,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
which, in general, probably goes

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
from Soviet times, but does not lose its relevance,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
because we all are dying

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
looking at the vision of the world

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
through the eyes of children.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
This unites us,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
because it gives us a positive charge of emotions.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
And we also posted

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
very interesting promotions,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
which were held in certain companies,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
and even not in our industry,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
as a source of ideas,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
so that you could see

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
where and what can be done,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
what to look up, what to adopt,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
loyalty programs were developed,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
offered not only to key clients,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
but also to selected ones, not to everyone.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
This is a very important point,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
because the company does not have enough resources

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
to provide such a list of services

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
to each client.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And moreover, an exclusive client,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
a key one, should feel

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
his exclusivity,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
offering such a program,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
you let him feel it,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
and you make it your partner,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
your friend,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and you strongly oppose

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
the fact that the client

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
should leave you for another competitor,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
for another company.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I also want to offer you

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
a table in your lecture material,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
where you will find

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
a rating of various promotions,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
based on their incentives.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
There are percentages,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
which promotion increases

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
the sales volume by how many percent.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Some promotions have a very long period,

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
a very long gap in numbers,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
but this is due to the fact

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
that I collected statistics

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
from different industries,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
from different sources,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
from different markets,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
so there are minimums and maximums

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
that I personally observed.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Maybe you will correct this table

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
according to your database

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and you will have a ready-made database

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
inside the company,

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
where you will note

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
how much and how your sales grew

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
during a certain promotion.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I would like to say a few words

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
about merchandising,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
just a couple,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
and in your lecture materials

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
there will be a more detailed

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
material on merchandising,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
there will be a development

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
of a standard of merchandising

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
for the company,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
which is very important

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
if your product is presented on the shelves.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
We will talk about the main points.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I would like to focus on the fact

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
that merchandising is art of selling,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
and in general it is a correct

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
and clear calculation

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
according to all the basic rules

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
of merchandising.
