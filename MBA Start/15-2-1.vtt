00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.720
Now we will briefly examine the general

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.920
structure of project management disciplines.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.400
What are the main elements it consists of?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.700
At the beginning of the course in

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.020
the interview, I said that

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.360
we would consider the entire material,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.160
adhering to international standards.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.720
The standards are recommended

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.100
and used by the

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.400
International

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.560
Project Management

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.260
Association.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.160
Well, we use Russian norms,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.860
namely the NTC of Russia, the National

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.140
Competence Requirement

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.880
in the field of project management.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.060
Here the general methodological approach

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.030
is such that the entire volume of project

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.430
management, the entire volume of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.270
project management disciplines

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.690
or the content of this part of human

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.050
knowledge is divided into three

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.890
main components.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.250
These are the objects of management, the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.670
subjects of management and the process of management.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.230
Here we will briefly stop on

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.010
each of these components.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.170
One of the main management

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.930
objects is the project.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.330
We briefly considered it.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.850
Now we will consider some aspects

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.590
of this management object.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.330
Thus, the objects of management include

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.810
the project, the program of projects,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.550
the portfolio or portfolios of projects,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.110
the systems, the project-

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.510
oriented organizations,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.470
the life cycle of the management

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.370
object and its phases.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.570
If we consider the project from the point

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.370
of view of a systemic approach, then

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.210
I have already said that the project approach

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.220
is primarily a process approach.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.560
Systemically, the project

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.120
is considered as a single phenomenon,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.340
inseparable and connected.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.060
This phenomenon has a goal at the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.660
entrance, and it is also a single or

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.160
unifying goal of the whole project,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.100
and at the exit a single result.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.220
Thus we see that the project can really

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.060
be considered as a single phenomenon,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.000
which covers all the components

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.220
of activity, one way

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.320
or another, involved

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.340
in the project.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.500
And in general, if we consider a project,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.860
the aim of any project is to change

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.780
the state of the system in which

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.140
the project is implemented or which

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.380
interacts with the project, from the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.980
state before the project

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.060
to the state after the project.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.990
In other words, we understand that if

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.070
we want to perform a project, then

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.630
first we must investigate what the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.970
purpose of this project is, what will

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.350
the implementation of this project

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.290
lead to, what will change as a

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.250
result of the implementation of

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.170
this project.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.150
In this regard, we would like to focus

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.750
more on the relationship between the objectives

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.090
and objectives of the project.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.470
Often in practice it happens that even

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.590
the manager, the project manager

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.430
does not quite clearly share the goals

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.110
and tasks.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.670
I have given an example of Stonehenge, and I hope

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.030
you have already felt the difference,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.190
the inner difference in the essence of

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.830
the purpose of the project and the task.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.730
The goal of the project is what we

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.970
should lead our system to.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.410
Usually the project is carried

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.890
out in an organization.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.730
This organization is called

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.930
a parent organization.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.730
The organization in which the project

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.830
is implemented is called the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.130
parent organization.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.170
So, first of all, the goal

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.470
of the project is to change

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.630
the state of the parent organization

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.270
as a result of the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.310
project.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.020
And we need to understand clearly that we can

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.000
somehow indicate the purpose of the project.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.820
But if we indicate the goal of the project

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.540
vague, diffuse, it will lead to the

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.400
fact that we will spend significant

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.120
additional resources in

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.940
the execution of the project.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.580
Hence the requirement to define the purpose.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.880
The goal should not be simply

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.560
qualitative, describe the

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.140
qualitative result of the project,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.860
but it should go away

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.380
from pluralism, ambiguity and should

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.000
be expressed in clear digital

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.860
indicators.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.380
So, the project begins with the fact

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.300
that we define its purpose.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.420
This is called project

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.100
management.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.120
Naturally, the goal we

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.260
must define as accurately

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.340
as we can, not using only

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.080
the general quality parameters,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.000
but above all using

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.380
quantitative parameters.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.560
If we talk specifically about some project,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.440
I will briefly give, for example,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.980
a project in the field of

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.680
information technology.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.840
Usually, in information technology,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.680
the purpose of the project implies

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.060
the implementation of a particular

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.700
system.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.770
Let us briefly consider the example

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.410
of implementing a project management

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.430
system, which is closest to our

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.970
course theme.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.770
In particular, let's say

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.690
we are considering a project to

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.910
implement the Microsoft Project

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.150
Management tool.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.870
Many managers believe that the

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.930
aim of this project is to develop

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.970
and implement a project management

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.330
system or to launch, install,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.290
in other words, this

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.890
Microsoft Project tool.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.550
However, if we look at this event

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.030
as a whole, we will see that the

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.930
purpose of this project is a

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.370
bit different.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.710
This tool is implemented

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.970
to increase the

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.910
productivity of work,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.830
say, 20 managers

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.930
or 20 project

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.670
managers.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.370
And from this point of view, it

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.190
is more correct to talk about the goal

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.190
of the project as the increase of the

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.770
productivity of the work of a given

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.970
pool of resources, which includes

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.050
20 project managers, a certain department,

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.790
which is part of a department

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.490
or other division

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.950
of the enterprise.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.990
At the same time, we need to define the

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.110
parameters of this goal more clearly.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.430
For example, to increase

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.510
the productivity of 20 employees

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.570
of the Information Technology

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.470
Department who are engaged

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.210
in project management.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.750
And not all projects

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.990
in a row, but projects,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.650
say, of medium-sized scale.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.950
We will talk about these parameters later.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.850
So, we fix the goal of the project where

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.370
we should come after the project

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.950
is implemented.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.930
These are the parameters

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.850
of labor productivity.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.210
In this case, we can identify

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.270
the goal as point A.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.470
Where do we go?

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.670
We also need to know where we are from.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.110
We are coming from point B.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.220
We need to know where we are

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.740
before we complete the project.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.760
And where we must come

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.100
as a result of the project.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.100
In practice, this event, the definition

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.680
or clarification of the purpose, as

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.880
a rule, takes place at a working meeting,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.820
at a meeting with the management.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.740
Suppose if the project is important

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.760
and captures the entire organization,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.520
then it is usually a meeting

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.740
with the CEO.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.400
The purpose of the project is clearly defined.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.360
The project is designed with specific

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.160
digital indicators.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.340
But this component, determining

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.280
where we are in the organization

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.300
before the start of the project,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.780
is called a pre-

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.580
project survey.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.840
And from the point of view of

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.920
the document of turnover, here

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.380
is the protocol of the pre-

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.400
project survey, and here

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.880
is, say, the protocol of the

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.140
meeting with the general director.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.660
A protocol with the analysis

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:24.380
of the need for the start of this project.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.620
If we have a pre-design

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.260
survey not exactly, and here the

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.970
parameters are not very accurately

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.230
fixed, then we will go from

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:46.270
this state to the goal, covering

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.210
such an area.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.930
Here, under the area, we can

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.550
understand the cost of resources that

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.610
are necessary for us to the project's goal.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.770
Hence it is obvious that if we are

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.510
to as a result of the pre-

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.950
project survey more accurately

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.210
and carefully fix the parameters,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.470
let us say, with such error, then

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.070
we will need significantly less

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.890
resources to implement

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:30.430
the project and its goals.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:38.910
We can use such resources.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.790


00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.830
The same applies to the accuracy and unambiguity

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.150
of the fixation of the project's purpose.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.750
If we do not have the project'

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.410
s goal defined, then as a result

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.450
we will be forced to spend

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.110
much more resources.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:09.170
Ideally, we spend resources

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.330
that can be depicted on this

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.310
chart by a shortcut or a section

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.550
from point B to point A.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.870
This is the ideal case when our area

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.530
is degenerating into a line.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.970
And we must strive in any

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.330
project to provide this condition,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.390
which can be expressed mathematically

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.630
as follows.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:46.890
The amount of all costs should be minimized.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.850
This is our main condition that we must

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.210
observe when starting, when determining

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:02.310
the purpose of the project.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.680
Thus, we fix the goal, fix

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:12.200
the current state of pre-

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.020
project or pre-project.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:21.040
Next we define the way we

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.380
will go from point A to point

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.420
B.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.700
That is, we have fixed the point

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.240
where we need to come as a result

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.880
of the project.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.680
We have a pre-project state analysis,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.340
point B.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.920
And we determine the ways we

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.660
can move from state B to

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.120
state A.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:59.400
maybe there is a way,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.800
and there can be several

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.040
such options.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.120
From these options we choose

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.220
the optimal path, based on the condition

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.980
we have now considered,

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.280
the minimum cost.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.160
This is usually the shortest

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.320
way from B to A.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.140
We found this path, we recorded it.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.460
And now we begin to determine

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.020
what tasks we need to solve,

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.240
what work we need to do, moving

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.460
from point B along this path

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.400
to point A.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.360
And so we break our way into

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.580
separate blocks of tasks,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.840
tasks and work that we must solve

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.020
in order to the project'

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.520
s goal.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.600
So, we understand that the goals of the

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.840
project and the goals of the project are

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.260
different entities.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.480
And the more carefully, the more

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.260
deeply we feel the inner content,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.160
the inner essence of these basic

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.000
concepts, the easier it will

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.220
be for us to organize this

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.360
whole event, to perform it.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.140
The more efficient, the

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.660
more professional we can

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.340
deal with project management.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.200
The purpose of the project is the desired

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.100
result of the activity achieved

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.920
as a result of the successful completion

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.000
and completion of the project under certain

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.780
conditions of its implementation.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.740
Project management is another

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.300
concept, such as project strategy.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.740
Project strategy is generally understood

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.040
as the whole set of techniques, technologies,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.720
techniques, plans, which describe

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.520
the ways of planning the

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.340
organization and the characteristics

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:20.740
of the project outcome.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.440
The objectives of the project are

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.940
a full set of activities, works,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.660
through which the goal of the project

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.980
is achieved.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.720
The next basic concept used when

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.140
describing a project management

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.500
object is the project structure.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.880
The structure of the project is usually

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.060
described based on hierarchical

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.340
structures, either from top to bottom

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.440
or from bottom to top.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.960
And these structures of the project

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.220
affect the purpose of the project, the

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.220
objectives of the project.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.540
The project structures can describe the

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.340
whole complex of problems that need

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.140
to be solved during the project execution.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.420
This structure is corresponding to the

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.860
so-called problem tree.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.420
Furthermore, we may have a structure describing

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.040
the results or decisions of the project.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.220
This structure is called the Tree of Decision.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.200
If we carefully write the entire

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.700
list of works, then we can also

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.980
structure this list

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.200
of works in a hierarchical way

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.400
and get the so-called structural

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.820
decomposition of works.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.640
Similarly, we can structurate

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.420
and decompose the project team,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.520
starting from the project

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.540
manager and ending with the ordinary

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.120
executives, team members.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.800
In English literature, the

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.960
generally accepted term Breakdown

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.660
is used, which can be approximately

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.460
translated into Russian

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.800
decomposition.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.900
Any project structure uses

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.240
this breakdown or decomposition

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.220
technology, or, in scientific

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.900
language, the method of

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.100
analysis, which allows us

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.040
to structure a problem,

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.480
a task, from top to bottom

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.680
hierarchically.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.860
This breakdown method, too, can be

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.500
said, is as old as the world.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.580
And if we take the Bible, for

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.340
example, one of the examples

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.500
that is mentioned there also

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.180
uses this method.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.920
In particular, it is said that even

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.820
a strong man will not be able to

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.920
cope with the problem of breaking the

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.040
crochet, and even a weak child

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.420
will cope with this problem if he dissolves

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.840
the crochet on separate components,

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.480
on separate branches.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.220
In the practice of design activities

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.080
this method is used very widely,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.400
and it is really effective.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.700
If you have any problem, try

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.660
to allocate a resource, allocate

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.540
time and carry out decomposition,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.460
break down the problem into components,

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.620
and then step by step, moving

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.480
from one part to another, you

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.300
can gradually solve the entire

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.640
problem, find answers to all

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.040
the questions asked.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.660
In English-language literature,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.920
a widely accepted abbreviation

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.060
is used, which corresponds

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.420
to the structure of

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.080
the project.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.280
I have already said that we can

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.260
use such a structure as the organizational

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.940
structure of the project.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.800
Organization Breakdown

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.260
Structure, or OBS

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.740
in English.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.540
Such an abbreviation will be met

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.780
with us in the know, and we must understand

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.540
what is behind it.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.300
SDR is the abbreviation

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.940
for Work Breakdown

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.140
Structure,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.020
or VBS.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.840
These abbreviations will also be used.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.380
Moreover, both of the abbreviation

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.320
OBS, VBS is widely used

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.500
in the most common

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.440
project management tools

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.900
such as Microsoft Project,

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.260
Primovera, Spyder and

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.380
others.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.220
Here on the slide you can see a very

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.840
simple picture of the hierarchical

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.980
model of the project structure.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.040
For example, at the top level,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.560
if we consider, say, the

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.000
project's organizational structure

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.220
or project team, at the top

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.800
level we have a project

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.900
manager.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.080
Next next level.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.000
His deputy as the deputy

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.820
project manager can be roles

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.420
such as project coordinator

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.720
or project administrator,

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.380
or project chief engineer,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.540
or project expert,

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.120
and so on.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.840
The next level, the third, we

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.340
can consider, suppose, managers

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.780
in individual directions.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.180
We call them linear managers or

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.320
linear engineers who perform

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.280
functions in one or another component

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.820
of the project subject area.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.340
At the bottom level, we have

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.840
the executives directly present.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.900
This is understandable in principle.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.680
Such a structure, such a display allows

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.380
us to very quickly and effectively

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.520
determine what a particular structural

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:01.340
representation of the project

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.080
consists of.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.400
If we talk, say, about structuring

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.900
a goal, then a general or general

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.760
goal is put at the forefront,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.780
and it can be decomposed

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.720
or disintegrated into separate

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.880
sub-objectives.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.400
The same is with tasks.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.500
If, for example, one of our

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.800
main tasks is building a

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.020
building, then we can decompose

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.980
this task into components in

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.000
chronological

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.100
sequence, or in functional,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.280
or in object, and so

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.840
on.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.700
For example, in chronological

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.860
sequence, the construction of

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.720
a building can be represented

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.900
in this form.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.740
We determine the purpose of the building,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.320
the technique of economic justification,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.040
then the technical task or private

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.160
technical task, then the sketch project,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.800
then the technical project, then

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.400
the working project.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.540
It is clear that at the same

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.720
time we can perform

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.440
such work as solving the issue

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.920
of land removal, solving the issue

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.680
of licensing for the land

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.080
plot, then a task block

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.040
related to consideration,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.220
approval in the relevant

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.040
instances, project documentation

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.840
for this building, communication

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.300
submission, task block

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.440
related to anepidemonadzor,

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.060
task block related

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.500
to energy supply,

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.920
ecology and so on.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.760
Here is the structural presentation of

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.620
the project in different sections, it

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.080
significantly facilitates the

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.860
planning of the project.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.280
Furthermore, we can systematically approach

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.020
the organization of the entire project,

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.440
the execution of the project, step by step

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.920
moving from specific levels of the hierarchy,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.620
without forgetting anything at the same

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.540
time in each structure.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.300
That is, at the same time we observe the

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.520
principle of full coverage for each representation

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.480
of the structure.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.740
It often happens that in the real execution

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.220
of the project, the participants

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.360
of the project, different legal entities

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.300
and even individuals, even members

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.880
of the same team understand differently

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.080
what a successful

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.360
project is.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.140
There are such case situations when

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.680
one participant, one team member believes

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.100
that the project is completed and

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.040
completed very successfully,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.600
but the other participant categorically

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.360
insists that the project is

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.240
completed unsuccessfully.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.000
In order to avoid such conflicts

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.900
in project management there is a whole

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.700
section, which is called the

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.360
criteria of success and failure

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.140
of the project or otherwise sometimes

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.200
called the criteria of failure.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.380
When we start working on a project

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.060
in the process of initiating

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.420
project activities, in the process

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.920
of planning, we must pay attention,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.340
allocate the resources to

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.840
clearly determine what we

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.620
will consider a successful

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.700
project.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.840
Moreover, the metrics themselves, the

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.400
parameters by which we will measure

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.980
these successful characteristics, we

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.400
must clearly define and agree with

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.620
all participants in the project,

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.040
with all members of the project

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.340
team involved in the project activities.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.180
For each metrics we determine

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.800
success, we must record

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.100
success indicators.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.060
That is, for example, we can

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.820
choose time as a metric, and we can

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.300
say that yes, if the project

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.880
is completed in a certain period

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.620
of time, say, 14 months, then

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.340
we will consider it to be completed

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.720
successfully.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.040
Here, the metric is the time, and the indicator

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.820
is the value, 14 months.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.600
It is clear that the indicator

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.140
itself is also determined

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.460
with some error, and we

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.320
must fix this error.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.180
Sometimes it is called the level

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.660
of assumptions, sometimes it is called

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.420
the level of tolerance, but in any

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.380
case we must fix the criterion

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.700
or metrics by which we will determine

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.600
the success of the project,

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.000
the indicator - the value of this

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.560
value, and the error that we

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.660
can allow when measuring the

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.240
success indicator.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.820
That is, we can record, say,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.080
by time, that we have 14 months,

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.300
well, at the same time we say

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.020
that error is allowed plus-

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.700
minus one month.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.220
If the project is completed

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.020
within this error, it is successfully

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.680
completed using this parameter.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.000


00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.780
Similarly, other parameters,

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.740
such as the budget, are used.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.960
Let's say we have a project budget

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.220
of one million rubles, and we

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.320
must fit in that million rubles, plus-

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.780
minus, let's say 100 thousand rubles.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.900
We have an error of estimating the budget of

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.700
100 thousand rubles.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.120
If we consider what are the internal

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.600
reasons for assessing the error of

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.060
these parameters, how to objectively

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.820
evaluate them and what they are related

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.460
to, then we are one way or another

00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:02.120
relying on what is associated with

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.520
risks, with uncertainties in the

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.980
course of the project.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.820
All the uncertainties in the

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.260
course of planning the organization

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.920
of the project, summarizing just

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.180
and should give us these assumptions,

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.400
plus-minus.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.860
It is clear that all these

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.520
uncertainties and risks, they depend

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.700
in large part on the internal conditions

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.140
of the project, that is, within the

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.020
organization where the project

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.120
is performed, and on the external conditions,

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.420
but above all these uncertainties

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.620
and risks depend on the professionalism

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.220
of the project participants,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.700
the team members, and above

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.680
all the project management,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.840
and in particular the project

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.920
manager himself.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.250


00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.370
The criteria for success are usually divided

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:08.090
into three areas, three main types.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.710
The traditional type is such criteria

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.410
of success, as we have already said,

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.950
time, budget, requirements

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.690
for quality in accordance

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.910
with the project and accounting documentation.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.230
The second type of criteria

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.490
is the type of criteria that

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.330
the customer or a participant,

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.570
a legal entity, determines,

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.810
and these criteria are specific.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.850
For example, one of the participants,

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.250
which may be a particular governmental

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:51.930
organization, it presents requirements

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.730
to the outcome of the

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.230
project such that this outcome,

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.990
product or service, accompanied

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.230
by certification, and

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.890
that product or service

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.450
must be officially issued

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:10.550
paper, document, certificate,

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.170
which fixes certain parameters,

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.830
specific parameters

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.690
of the project.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.470
In addition to these two types, there

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.550
is a third one that fixes benefits

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.910
for individual participants

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.170
in the project.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.690
It is clear that for, say, a project

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.190
customer who is interested

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.190
in, first of all, to receive a product

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.670
or service, the benefit we can

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:45.870
count directly in the amount

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:50.550
in which we have received the

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.810
product or service, and we can then

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.450
re-calculate the benefit in such

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:01.210
a way that the customer, having

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.870
received the product or service,

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.810
will receive dividends or profit

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.390
expressed in financial and economic

00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:11.790
equivalent, and this

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.870
profit can be calculated,

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.930
say, on the scale of year.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.830
And then we say that as a result

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.930
of the implementation of this project

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.950
the customer received a new product

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:28.190
or service, and this product or

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.830
service allows you to get

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.910
an annual profit in such a amount.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.550
For, say, the general contractor,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.410
the benefit is that, implementing

00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:45.090
this project, he receives a financial

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.430
compensation for the

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.290
fact that his resources participated

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.490
in this project and

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:56.510
so on.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.730
In the project activity, the environment

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:04.390
of the project is a very important

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.090
parameter.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.790
Under the project environment we understand

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:15.670
the environment in which the project

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:20.830
is immersed, which is characterized

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.030
by various parameters, for example,

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.610
the socio-economic environment, the

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.010
legal environment, the

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.250
technological environment, up to

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.510
the geographical or organizational

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.890
environment.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:43.930
It is clear that the same project with the

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:47.650
same subject area can be implemented

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.470
differently in the conditions of Russia

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:54.070
and in the conditions of the United

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:58.630
States or in the conditions of Malaysia.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:03.450
And here we are just facing the fact that the

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.290
external environment of the project has a

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.490
strong influence on its implementation.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.850
In addition to dividing the environment

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.270
into the external, we also need to

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:22.350
understand that there are internal components.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.850
It can also be attributed to the project

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.490
environment, but it is an

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:27.670
internal environment.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.570
That is, the project is immersed

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.250
in a certain environment,

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.290
and the interaction within the team,

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.990
within the team, within the enterprise

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:40.130
and all these conditions in which the

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.530
project is implemented, from this

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.110
point of view, we consider

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.850
as internal conditions of

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.230
the environment.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.950
More in full factors of the external

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.090
environment of the project

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.190
are listed in this slide.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.490
These are components that can affect

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.610
a project in a fairly significant

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:07.490
way, and we must definitely

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.790
take them into account.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.490
As I have said, these

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.350
are political conditions,

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.450
economic conditions, legal,

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.190
legal, cultural, national,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.870
natural, geographical

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.310
conditions.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.470
Naturally, conditions that

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:31.050
are characterized by our partners

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.470
or competitors to conduct

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.390
business directly in our area

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:39.230
or in related areas.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.010
There are other factors that influence

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.290
infrastructure.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.290
When we approach the process

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:52.610
of project management, it is very important

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:57.030
that in the project team, in the

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.650
team, in the organization

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.570
where we implement the project,

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.570
we speak the language that

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.830
is most appropriate.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.770
We speak and use those concepts,

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.070
terms that all our participants,

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.350
both individuals and legal

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:20.850
entities, understand uniformly.

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.510
If we consider one of the

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.330
basic regulations of project management

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.110
used in the enterprise, such as

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.070
the project management regulation,

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.350
then literally in the first

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.530
section, as a rule, there is

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:41.670
a votary, or a section that

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.530
describes the main concepts,

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.370
terms and definitions.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.650
This section clearly sets out both

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.590
qualitative and quantitative parameters

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.230
of certain definitions.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.630
For example, if we use the concept

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.030
of morje in design activities,

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:06.050
then a formula is required.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:08.910
If we use more detailed concepts,

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:12.250
say, gross or net, then

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.390
final formulas

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.070
are also used.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.390
If we use the concept of

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:23.210
profit, it is clearly fixed what

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.570
it is, as it is considered.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.150
And including varieties

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.970
that are used by this term

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.290
in the company.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.990
For example, a concept such

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:38.830
as gross profit, or there

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.690
final profit, or operating

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.390
profit, and so on can be used.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:51.890
If we do not fix these concepts

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.670
within the project team or on

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.950
the enterprise, then we can

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.650
have significant conflicts.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.550
Conflicts can occur between project

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:07.070
participants, between team members

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.730
and even within the management.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.970
For example, if I play

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.690
a role in a project team,

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.930
and if my motivation depends,

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.710
say, on morje, I can calculate

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:26.010
that motivation in

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.270
this way.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.230
I will get a certain number.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.630
That is, if I consider, let's

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.630
say, that my motivation affects

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.290
the variable salary component, which

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.630
is paid, let's say, once a quarter,

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.950
and I calculate it in a certain

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.230
way, then upon reaching the moment

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:50.790
of payment of this variable component,

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.030
someone of the key employees,

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:56.050
top managers, taking for the

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.530
definition of morje another

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.650
formula, can calculate it,

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:05.130
and it, the figure, will be

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.110
completely different.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.690
Then we begin to agree.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.510
One participant expects that

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.890
he will have such a component,

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.070
and he is charged, say,

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.070
several times less.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.570
Of course, this is a source of very

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.390
strong conflicts, and this all leads

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.270
to the fact that we have the project

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.810
in the efficiency of its implementation.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:38.010
Even the term “efficiency of

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.070
the project” we must describe very

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.750
carefully in the votary.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.490
If we use a professional

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:50.510
design approach, then we must

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.850
inevitably get away from ambiguity,

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:57.330
from multiplicity and come

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.630
to unambiguity.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.430
If we use the term project

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.510
performance efficiency, we must clearly

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:10.450
understand that this wording can

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:15.070
be understood by each team

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.210
member or project participant in

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.630
their own way.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.830
In order to avoid these different

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.830
interpretations, we explain

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.330
in the votary what the effectiveness

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.010
of the project is.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.770
As a rule, the effectiveness of the

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:31.930
project is understood as the fact that

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:35.970
the project will be completed within

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.850
the scheduled parameters that

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:43.290
we have fixed in the initiation

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.430
and planning phase in the

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:50.010
initial periods of the project.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.770
The effectiveness of the project

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.390
is understood as the result of the

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.650
project achieved within these

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.590
planning parameters, the quantity

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.970
and quality of the project

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.970
result corresponds to the

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.310
project documentation.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.630
And under the effectiveness of the project

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.210
we will understand the moment that it

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:19.370
is performed with maximum resource savings.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.330
And here is introduced

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.510
such a fundamental and very

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.070
important concept, which is

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.210
used in project activities,

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.870
as a return on investment,

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:36.210
or in English, a roy rate.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.530
Return is an investment.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.090
As it is specifically considered,

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:45.250
we will look at the section

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:49.550
that affects project cost management.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:53.370
But in general, the return on investment

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:56.590
is characterized by how many, for

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:02.090
example, copies of profit we will

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:03.850
get as a result of the

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.410
project for each ruble invested

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.590
in the project.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.810
Or, in other words, how many cents

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.630
of profit we will get from the project

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.470
completed for each dollar invested

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.030
in the project.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.630
It is an integral characteristic

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:24.290
of the project performance efficiency,

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.850
and it is very often used.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:31.250
This is already a digital expression of the term efficiency.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:35.550
In the future, we will always under the

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.510
term efficiency immediately automatically

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.890
understand that if we are talking

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.030
about increasing efficiency,

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:46.070
then we are talking about increasing

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:50.050
the project roy or about increasing

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.970
the staff schedule roy.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:58.050
The concept of roy of staff schedule

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.610
is also introduced, that is,

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:04.270
the return on investment in personnel.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:08.830
We will talk about it too a little later.

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:14.270
And the second section in the

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.330
main regulations on project management

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.470
in each enterprise, as I have already

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.990
said, for example, this project

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.050
management provision, can

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.790
be a project classifier.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.630
We will now look at the

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:33.370
classification of projects.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.920
The classification of projects can

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.440
also be carried out by different

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.100
metrics, by different parameters.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.220
As a rule, experts in the field of project

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.360
management methodology strive to

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.320
cover as many parameters as

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.900
possible, to classify

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.220
projects as accurately as possible.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.480
But here it is worth paying attention

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.320
to the fact that the more

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.360
complex the classification, the

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.120
more parameters in the classification,

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.180
the more resources we will spend on defining

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.140
the classification, and the more difficult

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.240
we will be to work with the results

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.520
of the classification, with the

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.440
choice of methods and tools for

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.660
project management.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.860
But in general, the role of the project

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.080
classifier is very and very important

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.180
in project activities.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.160
This is why this section is placed

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.160
in the second place in the position

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.320
of project management.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.520
It is clear that if we deal with

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.540
some small project, a short-

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:59.100
term project, a small scale, then

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.800
the requirements for the project

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.260
management process, procedures,

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.040
tools, technologies will

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.060
be defined, and this is usually

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.240
not very labor-consuming

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.340
simple management schemes.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.860
If we are talking about

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.420
a complex, complex, large-

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.120
scale, high-budget project, then

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.660
here the demand in project

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.380
management methods is very high.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.220
We cannot spend expensive

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.280
management, technological,

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.640
methodical resources

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:46.140
on managing small projects.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.380
That is, suitable for managing the entire

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.140
spectrum of projects in the enterprise,

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.220
we must consciously, strategically,

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.540
measurably choose one or another

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.340
approach.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:07.140
That is why there is a classifier.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.360
That is, if you imagine the entire

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.960
machine of project management

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.180
of the enterprise in the form of

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.940
a black box, then at the entrance

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.900
we have all the projects,

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.880
and at the exit we have this mixture

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.020
is chaotic or semi-chaotic,

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.720
it is already structured,

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.280
and all the projects are

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.800
placed on the shelves.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.820
Each shelf corresponds to a certain

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.420
set of techniques and technologies.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:49.020
Each of the shelves has its own implementation scheme.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.300
Each already classified type of

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.640
project will be optimally executed

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.180
using certain resources, schemes,

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:03.060
implementation procedures.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.560
Thus, we understand the importance

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.560
of the classifier and classification

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.900
of projects.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:16.940
Let us briefly look at the examples of classification.

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.220
In the slide we have given an example

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.960
of classification by several parameters.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.780
This, I would emphasize, is an example.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.040
Such parameters can

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.120
be much more.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.200
So, by size, we can

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.820
classify projects as follows.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.560
Multiprojects, monoprojects

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.360
and programmes.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.680
A monoproject is a project that

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.980
usually contains a similar

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:55.020
type of activity or a similar

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:58.660
type of subject component.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:03.160
For example, a monoproject is

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.680
the supply of servers for IT projects,

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.200
and if we have a territorial distributed

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.060
object, that is, we need to put

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.780
two servers of this type across

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.460
the entire territory of Russia

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.880
to all subjects of the Federation.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.300
This is a monoproject, and here the

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.060
substance is the same type.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.500
But if in addition to the supply

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.520
of this server economy we still need

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.360
to solve other tasks, let's say,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.640
we need to create a network

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.660
of communication, optical fiber

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.740
line to carry or lines.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.300
We need to connect satellite

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.060
communication, we need to connect

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.500
equipment, active network,

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.480
switches, routers.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.440
We need to solve the problems with

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.940
the telephone, to put

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.200
institutional automated telephone

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.560
stations.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.840
We need to solve problems with

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.840
time, service, billing subsystem,

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.680
we need to solve problems

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.840
related to information

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.360
security, we need to solve problems

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.760
that close the entire

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.360
complex of construction

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.180
readiness.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:37.380
This is no longer a mono project,

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.420
but a multi-project.

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.920
Multi-project contains several

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.620
different types, can contain

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.520
several different types of projects

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.400
in its subject area.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.240
Projects can be of the same type,

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.840
varied type, and so on.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.140
If we talk about a large complex

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.120
of projects, about a group of projects

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.360
united by a common goal, then

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.740
we are talking about a program of projects.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.820
This term is commonly used when

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.580
it comes to a significant

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:22.320
number of projects covering

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.280
different areas, functional,

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.040
plus significant areas the

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.220
project can cover.

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.800
And at the same time, the whole complex

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.240
of these projects we call a program,

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.780
a program of projects.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:43.670
We will stop on the programs

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:44.950
again later.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.320
According to the field of activity,

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.580
the classification may also be different.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.740
Well, here is an example of the division

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.600
of the following, technical projects,

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.160
organizational, economic,

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.840
social, mixed.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.580
Technical projects are those

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.780
projects that implement

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.300
some new technical solution,

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.060
or a certain technical

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.280
solution we need to implement

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.340
it.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.940
Organizational projects are usually

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.420
related to the creation of a new

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.660
organizational structure, either

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.020
reorganization of the staff schedule,

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:31.120
or change of the enterprise units.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.720
Economic projects usually

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.440
involve a change in the type

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.880
of property, for example.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.340
Social projects aim to change

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.760
the status of social groups or

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.520
provide them, for example,

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:58.650
a project to improve the provision

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:03.090
of primary school teachers.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.610
It is a social project.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.190
Any complex project

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.670
can be considered

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:12.470
mixed.

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.850
This includes a part of technical

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:18.070
projects, and organizational

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.910
and economic, and so on.

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:24.650
For example, if we consider the project

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.230
to launch a space mission to Mars,

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.410
it is clear that there are different

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.870
components here.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:35.530
There is a technical component,

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.310
and there is an organizational, and

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:40.550
there is an economic.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:45.900
In general, this is a mixed project,

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.140
and here sometimes a parameter is

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.900
disaggregated, which is called

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.720
the project purpose.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.740
Investment, innovation,

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.860
research and education.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.980
It is clear what is at the basis of

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.320
this division.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:09.600
If we implement a project so

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:13.500
that we have investments, investments,

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:19.200
and have their dividends,

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.560
such a project is often

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.540
called an investment.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.820
If we have a component in

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:31.300
the project that is characterized

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.140
by the fact that we apply

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:37.860
some innovations, or innovations

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:41.480
in the field of technology, or

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.120
methodical or instrumental,

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.220
it is an innovative

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.620
project.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.940
Research projects, it is clear

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.360
that here is the basis.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:59.060
Let's say, the event that we

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:01.080
can talk about in this video

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.660
course, we can call this

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.740
project educational.

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.240
The same project, referring to the

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.500
assistant mission to Mars, can be

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.480
characterized as mixed in

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:20.560
terms of the metrics of the classification

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.640
of the project by purpose.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.520
Because it is clear that this is a project

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.320
both investment and innovative.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.380
He is both research and, of

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.200
course, he may have a

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.220
component of educational.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.100
There is also usually a distribution

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.320
of funding.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.220
Generally, the division goes

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.420
to small, medium, large projects.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:55.680
But this division, it is such a specific

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.890
nature, for example, in a small private

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:02.300
firm such division has a graduation

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:06.460
into one, and if we take a large international

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.080
corporation, then there

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.780
is the concept of small, medium,

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.640
large project, they are already

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.920
different.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.020
For example, if in the first case

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.300
we have small projects

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.500
that can be characterized by

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.080
a maximum budget, say, $50,

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.800
000, then for international

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.820
corporations small projects

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.060
are projects that have a budget,

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:36.380
say, less than $100

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:37.660
million.

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:42.590
That is, we see that the

00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:46.310
classification depends significantly

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:49.490
on the type of business, and the external

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:52.770
and internal environment, and

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:56.190
the structures, and many other parameters.

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:01.430
Often use the classification

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:02.870
of projects by time,

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:04.870
chronology, duration.

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:07.790
In some organizations

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:11.570
short-term projects

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:13.410
are used, and this classifier

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:18.370
can show us that if

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.570
we are dealing with a short-

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:23.210
term project, its duration

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.350
does not exceed one year.

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:27.850
Medium-term projects from one to three

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:29.690
years, well, and long-term, let'

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:32.250
s say, above three years.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:35.030
If we consider classification

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.830
by time, then it is interesting to

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:42.550
analyze or consider the analysis

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.180
of the statistics of the duration

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:52.880
of projects by time.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.700
For example, if we take Western Europe,

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.040
then in the field of information

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.680
technology, having collected all the

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.440
statistics on duration, we can see

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.200
that usually the maximum duration of

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.560
projects of this type is in 3 years,

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:20.360
and projects with a duration

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.020
of 50 years are very few, projects

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:26.720
with a duration of

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.640
500 years are very few.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.980
And if we are really professionally

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.900
interested in project management,

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.640
then we analyze the classification

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.760
of projects by different parameters,

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.080
and this analysis can give us a

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.780
lot of interesting information

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.020
that shows how we now use our

00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.580
experience, the experience

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:57.320
of our predecessors, the world

00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.100
experience, and where, in principle,

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.640
project management can

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.860
move in general.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.540
Here is one example – the analysis

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:15.120
of project statistics by time, the

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.580
distribution of projects by time.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.520
The tail of this distribution

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:28.170
or long-term component, as a rule,

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.830
it, this component,

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.990
breaks in the area of 50 years,

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:36.010
projects with a duration of 1000

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:40.750
years we now almost do not observe.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:45.010
However, if you read the accompanying

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:48.230
materials on this course carefully,

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:51.130
in our section “History of Project

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:53.350
Activities” you can see that

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.590
humanity has dealt with projects

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.870
whose results are in demand

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:03.170
on a scale not 50 years

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:06.310
and not 500 years, but on

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:10.350
a scale, say, 5000 years.

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:12.670
There are such projects, the same Stonehenge

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.550
4000 years old.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.490
Or projects that are currently undergoing

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.410
quite real discussion, namely

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:26.290
the Dyson sphere project.

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:30.150
This is a project that will appear to

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.930
be implemented on a scale up to 3000

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:36.770
years, which is clear that it is

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.050
a long-term project.

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:40.750
In principle, it can be said that it has

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:43.230
already begun, since it is in the phase

01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:45.550
of initiation, in the phase

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.990
of discussion, and it is aimed at ensuring

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:52.170
the normal development and existence

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.270
of our grandchildren, the

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.610
grandchildren of humanity.

01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:00.590
I can briefly explain what the essence of

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:01.830
this project is.

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.410
Very interesting project.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.430
Scientists are worried about what is

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:10.530
happening on Earth.

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:13.670
We see how intensely the

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:16.970
Earth's resources are being consumed,

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:19.370
primarily fuel and energy, and

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:22.710
we understand that in the near future

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:24.290
we will face this problem

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:25.630
more and more hard.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.590
On the other hand, Tsiolkovsky said

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:32.630
that yes, the Earth is the cradle

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:36.950
of humanity, but it is not the time

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:40.350
for a baby to be in this cradle.

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:42.830
That is, we understand that sooner

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:46.790
or later man will leave Earth, and he

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:50.330
will begin to fill the surrounding

01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:53.610
space and somehow implement

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.770
projects of his expansion.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:00.850
And here is the Dyson sphere

01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:02.970
project – one of the projects

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.550
that is directed in this direction,

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:08.690
namely the creation of

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:15.170
such an orbital complex that would

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:19.370
accommodate a total number of inhabitants

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:21.530
significantly greater than

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:22.870
the number we now have on Earth

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.890
– 6 billion people, and this

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:28.790
Dyson sphere, it would be closed,

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.690
self-sufficient,

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:33.490
it would not depend on

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:36.690
the resources on Earth and

01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:39.470
would allow humanity to develop

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:42.090
already less tied to the

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.530
cradle.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.400
I made some retreat, which, in principle,

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.680
is quite interesting, I think,

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.740
and in general one of the tasks

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:58.520
of this course - somehow managers

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.660
are still included in the culture

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:05.120
of project management and show

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.780
where humanity is moving

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:12.800
in management, in project

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.920
activities.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.580
If we return to the classification

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.560
of projects, we can see a wide

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.820
variety of classification parameters.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.580
For example, projects

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:28.840
can be classified

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.640
by territorial characteristics,

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.320
by division,

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.120
as we say.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.060
If we consider the problem of creating

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.960
a classifier, then, as

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.240
I said, here we can

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.480
face a dilemma.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.760
On the one hand, we want to enter

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.020
as many parameters as possible

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.780
to make the classification

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.920
of projects more clear.

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.280
On the other hand, we will face the

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.660
fact that we can go into

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.480
methodological research, and on the

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.580
output after the classifier we will

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.340
get a very large variety

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:36.680
of different types I have faced

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.440
the problems of creating a classifier

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.380
in practice, and here is

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.440
one example.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.320
We considered the classification of

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.360
projects by duration in one of the organizations,

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.520
and when we compiled a preliminary

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.080
list of all projects, usually the

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.460
entire composition or box of

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.060
projects is also called a portfolio

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.600
of projects.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.420
We will return to that term.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.800
When the preliminary

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.020
portfolio of projects was compiled,

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.460
we analyzed, and what is

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.780
the minimum duration

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.380
of the projects in this enterprise.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:24.540
It turned out to be two months, with

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:28.180
projects being conducted from two months

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.080
in duration to about eight years

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.100
in this range.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.620
Initially, we had the setup that

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.560
we should introduce a classifier

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.280
by project duration.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.920
After we considered that we had

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.700
a range from two months to eight

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.200
years, we began to analyze how

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.700
fundamentally our short-term

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:56.340
projects would differ, let'

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.920
s say up to one year or up

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.080
to three months.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.060
Short, medium and long term.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.680
It turned out that the main parameter of the

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.840
difference will be the characteristics of

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.340
the document of turnover and reporting.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.980
For example, if we have short-term

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.200
projects and they take a month,

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.340
let's say, we can enter a reporting

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.860
in a day, and sometimes

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:31.060
in short-term projects a

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:34.620
daily reporting is introduced.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:40.100
If we consider the specific situation

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:43.540
at the mentioned enterprise,

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.240
where the minimum duration

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.860
of two months for projects,

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:52.780
we will see that such projects,

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.600
first, very little, second, they

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.520
are not very important, well, and,

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.080
third, if we take and reduce

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.240
the reporting and sales documents,

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.720
this procedure, to weekly,

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.260
that is, reports will be made

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.260
weekly, then, in principle,

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:16.140
this approach can be quite

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.180
effective here.

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.900
On the other hand, reporting on

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.500
a project that we have been running

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.060
for 8 years, with a period of more

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.280
than 1 month, is not very

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.480
effective, and the management still

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.360
wants to have a weekly reporting

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.260
control system.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.000
Thus, we come to the conclusion

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.500
that for the entire portfolio of

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.500
projects in this enterprise is

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.960
a suitable weekly reporting

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.360
system, and it makes no sense to divide

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.120
projects by time into some

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.400
internal types for us.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.200
So we take and remove this

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.040
metric, dividing by time.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.000
Thus, by very carefully

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.860
analyzing the creation of

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.880
a classifier, we can such

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.620
a design when it is a relatively

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.880
simple design and at the

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.400
same time solve its main

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.500
problem.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.800
In principle, we have information

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.100
on the classification of projects in

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.120
the accompanying materials, and

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.440
you can consider it in more detail.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.800
In general, I will repeat, the classifier

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.420
is the most important component

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.200
in the project management process.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.260
And here one of the most important

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:52.220
parameters of classification can

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.560
be such a parameter as division

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.960
by importance or by priority.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.100


01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:04.360
If you look at the typical,

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.480
most popular project management

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.020
tools, such as Microsoft Project,

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.560
Primovera, Spyder, or others,

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.360
you will see that there is

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.520
a necessarily the concept

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.060
of “priority.”

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.740
This is when we talk about

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.880
the classification of projects, the

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.620
concept of the "priority" of the

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:31.320
project is also introduced, and here

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.760
the rational use of this

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.040
parameter is very important.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.640
And if we have this parameter to be

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.380
determined very carefully,

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.100
professionally, then the return

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.240
from such a classifier will be very,

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.060
very large.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:56.940
For example, we will consider projects of

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.360
enterprises of the scale of a group

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.000
of companies, Holding.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.640
If we have projects that affect the

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.300
entire complex of the organization

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:12.400
at the holding level, then this project

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.440
can be assigned "highest priority",

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.720
for example, number

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.500
one.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.140
If we consider projects that describe

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.160
the scale of the organization

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.300
of a subsidiary, we can

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.960
assign “priority number two.”

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.740
If we consider department-scale

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.520
projects within the organization,

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.380
we can assign “priority

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.300
number three.”

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.980
We can consider projects

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.180
there, say, with “priority number

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.120
four,” and it covers only

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.280
a separate group, which is

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.540
an internal unit of the department.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.040
And we can, for example,

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.060
consider projects with a “fifth

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.480
priority” that we have is

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.020
a “background”.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.920
For example, we enter the room, and

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.220
the head of the enterprise

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.800
says, in general, you need to

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800
make a cosmetic repair, not the

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.240
color we have.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.380
We understand that this project can be

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.760
immediately attributed to

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.180
the “background”, “fifth priority”, and

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.420
it is implemented in such a way that

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.600
if we have resources in the

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.260
enterprise, we are engaged in that project.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.940
If there are no resources, we can somehow

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.560
move it, postpone it.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.960
What does this divide priority mean?

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.680
In practice, this means the following.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.660
At a meeting with the CEO

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.120
or the manager, where, let'

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.260
s say, I call as a project

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.720
manager and I position

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.380
myself as a project manager,

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.100
the CEO says that “yes,

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.500
this project we give

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.680
priority number three.”

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.980


01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.720
This means that I can take all

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.100
the resources from the

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.880
priority number five project,

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.380
and I agree with

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.600
the priority number five

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.860
project manager.

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.860
I can take resources from the

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:18.120
priority number four project,

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.140
but I have to agree with

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:23.640
the project manager.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.680
If in the first case, when I

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.620
took resources from project

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.280
No. 5, I only notified the

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.480
project manager, then in the

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.380
case of priority of the fourth

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.040
type I must already notify

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.080
and agree with him.

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.940
Then I can take resources from projects

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.580
with priority equal to my project,

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.440
that is, with priority

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.160
number 3.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.880
But at the same time I

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.160
must already agree with the

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.920
head of this project, with the

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.540
head of the relevant unit.

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.820
That is, the scheme and chain

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:06.220
of coordinating actions are changing.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.600
And then, if I want to take resources

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.020
from a project with priority No. 2 and

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.800
a pace with priority No. 1, the

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.840
system categorically prohibits

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.500
me from doing so.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.120
Why is?

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.020
I have a project with priority

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.220
number 3.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.180
Thus, this parameter, priority,

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.020
is the same parameter or leverage

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:38.260
that is placed in the

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.780
hands of the top management

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.580
of the enterprise or

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:46.460
specifically the CEO or

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.640
one of his deputy.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.920
And if the CEO puts this parameter

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.940
in a certain way, then it immediately

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.660
determines the sequence

01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.280
of allocation of resources

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.720
and the order of allocation

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.040
of resources to the project.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.640
I can in the preliminary phase, in the initiation

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.800
phase, having received this parameter

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.800
No. 3 priority, calculate the duration

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.940
of the project within the limited

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.300
resources available to me.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:22.340
Suppose it was a year and a half.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.780
I then give these assessments

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.580
to the relevant director,

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.560
the same general director.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.860
If this situation is suitable for him,

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.040
he says, all, there were three,

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.040
so there will be three.

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.680
We will carry out this project for a year

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.820
and a half.

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.420
If he sees that this project can't last

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.560
for one and a half years, he

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.880
says, yes, this project is more

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.640
important, and let's change his

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.580
priority from the third to the

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.140
second.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.900
I am re-calculating with

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.480
the second priority, and I have a reduced

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.820
duration of up to eight months.

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.580
Thus, we really see that a seemingly

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:07.120
insignificant certain parameter there

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.100
priority of projects

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.240
can significantly affect the

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.000
implementation of the entire strategy

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.280
of the enterprise.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.940
That is, it is really a strategic

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.860
lever for managing the entire

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.900
enterprise.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.540
Classification, project classification,

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.140
a very important component

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.540
of project activities.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.260
So we continue to consider the control

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:41.740
objects, and we have passed a

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.500
significant amount of the object

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.040
that we actually define

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.980
as a project.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.580
Next on the list of management

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:59.080
objects we have a program of projects.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.420
We have also considered it in part.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.400
The project programme is a

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.800
group of projects united

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.800
by a common goal.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.720
The next management object is the portfolio

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.780
of projects.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.880
We have also been partly concerned with

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.640
this object.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:22.860
And the portfolio of projects, unlike the

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.180
program of projects, is primarily determined

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:29.100
by the total pool of resources.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:34.740
For example, if we say that we are

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.380
considering a portfolio of holding

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.600
projects, it may mean that we are

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.720
considering all the projects

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.860
that are performed by all the resources,

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.300
primarily the human resources

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.800
of that holding.

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.600
If we say that we are considering

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.560
a portfolio of projects of a subsidiary,

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.720
then we are talking about

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.820
all the projects that are executed

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.860
by that subsidiary and

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.920
are executed by the employees

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.740
of that subsidiary, that

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.660
is, a pool of labor

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.180
resources.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:15.840
Naturally, in addition to labor, as

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.580
we have already said, there are

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:18.700
also material and technical,

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.600
technological and so on resources.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.660
Thus, we see that a portfolio

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.760
of projects can be called a group

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.820
of projects united by a common pool

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:36.720
of resources and united by a

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.380
common strategy or a common

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:41.760
strategic goal.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.240
In general, a portfolio of projects,

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.180
a business process can use very

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:54.180
much different from a business

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.600
process management of a

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.540
single project.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.540
That is, if we consider the business

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.600
process of one project, it can be significantly

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.840
different from the business process

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.660
of the entire portfolio.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:13.280
And we will look at these differences in

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.460
one of the following topics.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:22.160
The next object of management is the

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.260
life cycle of the project and its phases.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:32.100
On the slide you see a typical

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.680
example of splitting the project life

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.340
cycle into separate phases.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.980
The life cycle of a project is the

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:44.080
entire time period that takes the

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:48.480
project from the first action, from

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.960
the very beginning of the initiation

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.680
to its complete completion.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.820
This period is called the life cycle.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:01.820
At the same time, within the life

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:04.820
cycle, separate areas with clearly

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.280
defined parameters are identified,

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.140
which may vary depending

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.540
on the location of this part at

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.280
the beginning, in the middle,

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.980
intermediate or final part

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:21.060
of the life cycle phase.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:24.160
This division by chronology, by time,

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.780
is called the division of the project

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.460
into phases.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:34.420
The life cycle of the project is divided into phases.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.220
The standard division of a project

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.300
life cycle into phases usually

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.360
combines four phases.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.440
It is a concept or conceptual phase.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.980
The development phase of the subject area

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:53.480
or in English is the design

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.620
development phase.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.140
At this stage, we are developing a

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.200
project for estimated documentation.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.960
The next phase of the project and the

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.400
completion phase.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.460
However, this division is not

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:15.100
dogmatic and the division into phases

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:18.240
of the project life cycle depends

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.220
largely on the type of

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.780
business.

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:28.180
If we look at the typical division

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.440
into life cycle phases according to

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.660
the type of business we see in the next

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.720
slide, we will see a significant

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.800
difference.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.580
For example, if we consider the division

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:45.080
into phases of the life cycle of projects

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.040
that are implemented in state-budgetary

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.340
organizations of the Russian Federation,

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:53.840
we will see that there are

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.640
specific phases.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.700
This specificity is primarily

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.940
due to the fact that in

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.140
a significant part of projects,

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.000
a significant part of contracts,

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.160
contracts, under which the work

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.120
of state budget organizations is

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.420
carried out, we are obliged

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.720
to provide for the so-called

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.860
tender event.

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.340
Accordingly, we have the preparation

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:25.340
of the tender, the holding of

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.700
the tender, and this event

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.180
is aimed at selecting

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:36.660
the most professional, apologize

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.240
for tautology, candidates

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:44.220
among general contractors or

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.580
contractors for the implementation

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:50.740
of this project.

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.780
And this approach is regulated by

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.420
the corresponding package

01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.480
of documents, and we see that in

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.980
a large part of the projects carried

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.760
out by state budgetary organizations,

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.660
there is a phase of tender

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:11.340
preparation, tender conduct.

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.500
Thus, the lifecycle of these

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.920
projects can be presented

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.620
as follows.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:21.140
The initiation phase, the tender preparation

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:23.360
phase, the tender conduct, the development

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.480
phase, the execution and the completion.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:33.600
In many projects in the IT sphere, in

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.540
the field of information technology, in

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.860
many projects of construction business,

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:40.980
other types of business, the first

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.520
start-up phase of the life cycle is

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.040
usually called the phase of initiation.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.520
It is important to note that

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.400
the word initialization is often used.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.460
This is not quite correct, it

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.920
is more correct to use the word

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.720
initiation.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.800
Although, if you look into the interpretative

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.540
dictionaries, you will find what the term

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.260
initiation means.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.880
This is, as a rule, a term

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.940
that characterizes the formation

01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.400
of a developing, yet unripe organism,

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.900
its transition to the stage of

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.740
a mature, mature organism.

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:31.540
Therefore, we can use this term, here

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.800
the term initiation, in the sense that

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:40.800
we from the stage of the phenomenon,

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.600
from the stage of working with an

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.260
idea, translate this idea already

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:54.880
into the state of the project.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.680
This phase can be called

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.460
initiation.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.080
Thus, the phase of initiation usually

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.020
means the whole set of activities,

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.820
which includes the processing

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.460
of an idea, the work on an

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:16.600
idea, the determination of parameters

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.380
of feasibility, the translation

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:24.560
of this idea into the state

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.680
of the project.

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:31.560
The initiator of the project, it

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.440
can be a natural person, it can be

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.980
a legal person, is working on

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.840
the idea.

01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:41.220
In this case, such documents are

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.100
considered, for example, as protocols

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:47.300
of intent, or the technique

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:50.300
of economic justification, or the

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.220
draft of the technical task.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.960
That is, different documents

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.240
can accompany this phase, and this

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.520
phase really includes an

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.220
analysis of the feasibility

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:07.340
of opening the project.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.900
The next phase, for example, the phase

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:14.840
of concept or concept development,

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:18.080
is characterized by the fact that we begin

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.400
to consider strategic approaches

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.120
to the planning of the organization

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.820
and the execution of the

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.200
project, as regards the methodological

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.600
part.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.500
As for the subject area of the

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.900
project, actually design, we in

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:40.560
this phase conceptually consider

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.920
how we will construct the

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.500
architecture of the project or

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.880
the design of the subject

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.720
area, the end result, product

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.940
or service.

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.500
At this stage, a

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:03.120
draft of a technical task

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:06.500
or a sketch project may be

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.700
developed.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.240
Next we move to the development

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.400
phase, and at this stage the

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.460
final version of the technical

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.360
task is already developed in detail,

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:22.320
the project, the technical project

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:27.820
and the working project are developed.

01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:34.260
If the event itself as a project, it has

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.160
a small scale, then it can be combined,

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.720
and we see in practice that the combination

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.880
of the technical project and

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.380
the working project is taking place, and

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.460
in this situation in the development phase

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.100
of the project a techno-working

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:50.600
project is created.

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.860
In short, what is the difference between a sketch

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.000
project from a technical and a work project?

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.100
Again, the sketch project fixes the general

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.600
architecture of the subject

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.060
area, the concept.

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:09.040
The technical project unfolds these

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.660
conceptual solutions to technical

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:15.080
solutions, to specific technical

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.240
solutions.

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.700
They are described in this document

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.960
in full.

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:25.720
The work project takes the technical

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.020
project and specifically applies

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:30.860
to the object.

01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.700
For example, if we are talking

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.180
about a project to create a

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.120
local computer network, and there

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.740
we have a structured cable system,

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:41.320
then the technical project gives us

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.740
all the technical solutions, and

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.600
the work project shows that specifically

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.220
there, on the third floor of this

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.420
building, in such an entrance

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:54.240
we have the SKS through such

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.500
a 40 cm of the fence begins,

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.860
and then this whole specific

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:01.840
bond is fixed in the work

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.680
project.

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.800
The work project is the most important

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.540
in terms of the operation of

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:13.440
the end product or service of the project.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.460
It is the work project that records

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.720
the actual state of what

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:21.300
is done as a result of the project.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.260
It is the work project that carries all

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:26.900
the final accurate decisions, accurate

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.520
numbers, and that we must understand.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:35.040
Then comes the next phase.

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.900
stage of implementation or implementation.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.780
Sometimes this phase is called

01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.820
really differently.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.660
Implementation, implementation and implementation.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:50.100
This phase is completed by the fact that

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.400
we have a finished product of the

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.680
project at the output.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.580
Product or service.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:02.940
Moreover, this phase includes trial

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.940
operation or the execution

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.940
of the pilot part of the project, where

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:12.180
there is a repair, repair, elimination

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.640
of some deficiencies.

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.800
and so on.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:20.360
And the next stage within this phase

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.840
is the introduction of the product or

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.540
project result into production operation.

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:33.340
As a rule, this is completed by the fact

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:36.120
that we sign the act of receipt and

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:40.480
produce the mutual accounting, financial

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.200
and economic accounting between the

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.760
participants of the project.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.340
For example, the contractor

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.060
to sign the act of delivery receives

01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:55.680
the corresponding amount for the services

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.320
provided, the works performed

01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.360
to the customer.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.660
This is all stipulated in contracts,

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.520
contracts and other legal

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.380
documents that accompany

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:08.500
the project.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:12.520
Actually, the completion phase

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.480
of the project begins with the signing

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:20.120
of the act of handing over the final

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.400
product or service into

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.460
operation, carrying out mutual

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.020
accounts and some subsequent

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:30.540
activities, which I will tell you

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.460
a little later.

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:36.280
Thus, we see that the beating

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.780
of the project life cycle into phases

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:44.060
is not hardly defined once

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:48.260
and for all, and here the project

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.840
manager or top management

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.780
of the organization chooses

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:55.920
the most optimal division.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.980
Accordingly, this division into phases

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:02.100
depends on the type of projects and

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:05.420
is recorded in the regulatory documentation.

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.200
In general, if we consider

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:13.100
the life cycle of the project,

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:18.600
we will see that over time, in

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.400
chronological ranges, as we

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:23.080
move from the first phase, say, initiation

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:26.140
to the final phase of completion,

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.760
we see how much the main key

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.640
parameters of the project

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.400
change.

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.120
For example, the exact time of the project

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.000
or budget or the characteristics

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.480
of the final product.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.120
If we can determine these parameters

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.320
with little accuracy in the

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.060
initial phase of initiation,

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:51.760
then we must bring this accuracy

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.700
to a high level by the

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.560
stage of implementation.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.360
In the first phases, say, the initiation

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.580
phase, as a rule, estimates of the

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:06.580
budget, the time of the project

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:09.200
are with a plus-minus accuracy

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:12.240
of 50%.

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.360
Of course, such estimates

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.700
require little resources to evaluate.

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:21.460
Use the resources of an experienced

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:23.100
expert.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.840
Sometimes such assessments are carried out

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.660
by top managers of the organization.

01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:31.840
That is, in the early stages

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.440
of the project life cycle, we can

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.820
use small resources to determine

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:40.040
the main parameters of the project,

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.080
as I said, such as time, budget,

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.060
resources, labor,

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:49.340
other resources.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.500
And this can be done, say,

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.480
one expert, several experts or

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.820
top managers.

01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:00.540
In this phase, we usually

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:06.320
perform intuitive assessments.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.380
That is, a specialist, based on

01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.980
his previous experience, based on

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.180
knowledge, based on skills, based

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:17.720
on internal sensations, can give

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.660
these assessments.

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:23.720
If these estimates need clarification,

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.400
then experts are involved

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.640
and thus accuracy increases.

01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:33.020
But in rare cases, more time-

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:35.560
consuming, powerful tools are

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.900
used in the initiation phase to determine

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.160
the key parameters of the project.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.580
This usually happens in the

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:46.940
next phase.

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:53.620
I have already talked about the balance between the objectives and

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.920
objectives of the project.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.320
When we have determined the goal of

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:03.100
the project, when we have fixed the

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.840
position where we are in the pre-project

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.580
survey, when we have determined the

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.340
paths that we can move from

01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:14.040
the state that we have before the

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.240
project to the state that we will

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.000
have after the project, in this situation

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.380
we already on each of the possible

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.420
ways of implementation of

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.920
the project should evaluate the

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.300
key parameters of the project

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.820
more accurately.

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.360
And here, as a rule, accuracy

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.540
is used 30%, not worse.

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.980
This phase can be called either

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:45.700
conceptual or the phase of choice.

01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:50.680
As we can see from the slide,

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.060
at the selection phase, the key

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.020
parameters of the project are compared

01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.580
to different options.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.060
The optimal solution for the implementation

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:04.120
of the project is selected.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.140
After this optimal option has

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.960
been chosen, a tender on the terminology

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:15.400
of state budget organizations

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.600
has been conducted, we are

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.780
already moving to the final

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:24.440
planning of tasks and works

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.960
on this chosen project

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.820
implementation.

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:33.080
At the exit we should get documents

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:36.520
and assessments of the key parameters

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:39.840
of the project already with more meaningful

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.380
accuracy.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.480
Usually it is 5%.

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:50.020
In large and complex projects, especially

01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:53.140
this shows the experience of Western Europe,

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.720
the experience of the United States,

01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.480
the accuracy of the key parameters

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.800
of the project at the completion

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.500
of planning should be about 2%.

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:10.100
For example, if we have a project

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:13.360
budget of $1 billion and we

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.440
have a project that is very

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.260
significant, complex, complex,

01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:22.560
large-scale, it is clear that

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:26.400
if we plan its execution with

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:30.040
little accuracy, let us assume

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.080
10%, then 10% of the $1 billion

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.380
is $100 million.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:38.220
With such accuracy, of course, no

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.040
owner, no CEO in our understanding,

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.040
or the president of the holding

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.900
company in the West, he will

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:47.740
not sign the documents for the

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:50.320
opening of the project.

01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:52.280
It is clear that in such a situation,

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.020
the normal accuracy, which may be

01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:58.400
acceptable, is significantly better.

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:03.960
Usually it is 2-1%.

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:09.980
We can talk about the budget

01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:11.420
accuracy.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.340
In general, if we have a budget

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:18.760
of 1 billion, then the spread

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.500
or accuracy may be acceptable 10

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.640
million, but not more.

01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:26.320
This is 1 percent accuracy.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.980
Thus, we see that the

01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:35.600
project planning process

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.540
is iterative.

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:40.220
If in the initial phases we

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:43.000
determined parameters with little

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.620
accuracy, then in the subsequent

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:47.820
phases this accuracy increases,

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:50.140
increases and increases.

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:54.760
And the ultimate accuracy is determined

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:59.140
by the quality of project management,

01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.460
and the capabilities of the owner or

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.340
management of the enterprise,

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.140
the capabilities of reserve resources,

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:10.300
the capabilities of allocating

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:12.620
funds for risk coverage.

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:16.280
In fact, the level

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.340
of uncertainty, accuracy or error

01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.840
on the other hand, from which

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.520
we can determine key parameters,

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.880
this error should be

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:29.700
covered by those reserves

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.700
that we allocate to the

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.100
elimination of unforeseen

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:36.140
situations or, as we say,

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:38.440
to risk management.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.980
As a rule, this error should

01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.980
always be covered by the budget,

01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:47.160
a budget article called the budget

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.400
reserve, which in enterprises

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.740
of mature business level

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:58.200
is called the budget for

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.560
the coverage of project

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.120
risks.

01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.960
When we approach the implementation

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:12.800
of the project, accuracy at our maximum

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.740
and here all documents, all calculations

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.560
are verified and only after that

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.940
we can give the entire package of documents

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:22.320
for the opening of the project,

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.500
for signature to the general director

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.900
or the relevant official.

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:32.400
Then the project is started.

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:37.280
Here, there should be a difference in

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:41.160
methodological approaches in the field

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.960
of management, in the field of

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.660
project management.

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.260
The methodological approaches

01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:51.660
may vary greatly depending,

01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:54.340
I have already told you, on

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.760
the project environment.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.900
For example, if in the United States

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:06.300
projects are surrounded by a clearly

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.340
verified financial economic

01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:10.480
situation, legal, laws are

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:14.280
carefully prescribed and regulated,

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:17.420
including project activities,

01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:19.820
then in Russia, especially during

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:22.660
the restructuring period, the

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:25.520
situation was slightly

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.180
different.

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:30.220
And many laws are unclear,

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:33.740
ambiguously regulated our activities,

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:36.360
business, including

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.980
project activities.

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.220
Hence the objective basis for

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.580
what we in Russia to manage projects

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:50.720
should be a little different.

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.520
The life cycle of the project should

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.820
cover activities that are already

01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:01.460
at the start of the project, and

01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:04.460
should include a clearer definition

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:07.740
of the conditions for planning

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:11.320
and implementation of

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.060
the project.

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:16.540
A clearer definition of the project

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.040
objectives, many parameters

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.220
of project execution, strategic approaches

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.460
and methods.

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.840
And, accordingly, this requires a more

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:31.160
clear analysis of the consequences of achieving

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.420
the project objectives.

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:38.160
These moments greatly differ the life cycle

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.260
of the project in Russia and the life

01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:43.660
cycle of the project, for example, in

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:46.180
the United States.

01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:51.220
It is therefore clear that not

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.560
all the methods that are successfully

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.120
used in the West can be effectively

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.200
used in Russia.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.100
We must understand this, and we have

01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:08.520
no right, as they say, to take, thoughtlessly,

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.000
blindly, those methods recommended

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.620
to us that are successfully

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:17.340
used in the West, and apply

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.420
them in Russia.

01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.820
In some situations, this will

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.860
not lead to success, and in

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.360
some situations, using these

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.920
methods can only harm us.

01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:31.420
We must be careful about

01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.520
this and work in this direction.

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.200


01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:38.520
In the project activity in Russia, the

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.920
phase of initiation and the phase

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.420
of completion is very important.

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:48.600
We must allocate the appropriate resources

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.140
for the qualitative, professional

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:54.120
consideration of these phases,

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.800
for the qualitative, professional

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.700
planning of the work on

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:02.580
these phases.

01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:09.380
When you start to be interested in issues

01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:14.000
such as whether or not there is project

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.460
management in the enterprise,

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:19.320
in principle, you can look at the

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:23.560
essence, for example, the completion

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:25.240
phases.

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:29.380
If a project management

01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.680
system is implemented and it

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:34.060
is effective, the content

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:37.280
of the project completion phase

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.860
in such an organization is very

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.080
different from the completion

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:45.960
phase in the organization,

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:49.860
where the management

01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:51.820
methods can even be present,

01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:53.340
but they do not

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:56.060
actually work there.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.020
The example.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.440
Often it is said that a project

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.220
is completed when the acceptance of

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:10.300
the results of the project, product

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:12.980
or service is signed and financial,

01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:14.500
economic relationships

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:17.900
between participants are carried out.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.680
That is, in accordance with, say,

01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:22.000
the contract or contract we perform

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.980
those items that prescribe the

01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:26.840
following that the customer

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.600
is obliged to sign the act from

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.860
the reception department

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.600
within, for example, five bank

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.580
days to pay the executor

01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:40.640
such an amount for the work done.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.420
As a rule, many companies say

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:47.480
that this event and the

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.400
project ends.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.100
However, if we look at the

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:54.000
situation more closely, we will see

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.140
that in those cases where managers

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:02.060
of the management of the enterprise,

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:04.160
top management, counsel and

01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.120
care that the activities, project

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.260
activities of the enterprise,

01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:13.140
business went more

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:16.080
efficiently.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.440
In the slides, we immediately recall

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.480
that the word “efficiently” we interpret

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.620
as follows.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.020
Profit is growing, royals

01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.900
are increasing, return on investment

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:30.280
is corresponding.

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:34.480
In these enterprises, the content of the

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.300
completion phase is completely different.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.060
The completion phase in these

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:41.900
enterprises only begins with the signing

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.940
of the act of acceptance and carrying

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.960
out the mutual accounts.

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:51.240
And the main content, the work in

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.820
this phase, it follows these activities.

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:56.920
I will explain.

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:01.920
In those enterprises where

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:03.860
a project management system is

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:08.800
developed and implemented, and where

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.000
it essentially works and works

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.520
effectively, there is an

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:22.300
analysis of the project.

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:28.800
Any phase of completion of the project

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.740
in such an enterprise, regardless

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:33.840
of the type of project we

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.340
use, what life cycle we consider

01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:40.360
and what division into phases of

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.100
the life cycle we use, any

01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:44.620
phase of completion necessarily

01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:46.580
contains such work as preparing a

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.780
summary project report, summarizing

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.240
results, analysis of results,

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:57.000
conclusions and recommendations

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.420
on the project performed.

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:04.720
And this happens in such a way that

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.640
we, after conducting the next project,

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:14.680
accumulate experience, our enterprise

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.100
becomes more mature, it absorbs

01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:19.740
this experience.

01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.120
And already in the next project

01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:26.080
of this type, or in a project

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.960
related to this type of business,

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.720
we are, as they say, not on the

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.580
same rocks.

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.280
We do not repeat the same mistakes.

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.360
We analyze the project for its

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.360
strengths and weaknesses.

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.920
We will further publish and actively

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:47.860
use the strengths, achievements

01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:52.460
in the project, successful solutions,

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.840
and try to bypass the

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:57.800
negative moments and failures

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.680
in the following projects.

01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.940
This is achieved by the fact that the

01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:08.440
completion phase of the project

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.420
is the analysis of the project,

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:14.080
and this analysis gives the results

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.100
in the relevant business process,

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.820
which adjusts through the

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:20.880
reengineering process of

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.200
business processes, in fact,

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.040
and the project management

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.400
process itself.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.620
Other business processes involved

01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:30.840
in the project activities.
