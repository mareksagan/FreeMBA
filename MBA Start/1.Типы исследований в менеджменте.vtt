00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Dear listeners, in this case, viewers, let me introduce myself.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Zhubreva Tatyana Vasilyevna, candidate of the Technical Sciences,

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
a lecturer of the Russian Economic Academy named after Plekhanov.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
The course that we will study today is called

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
methods of research in business.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Business is a very, very complex, unpredictable structure.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
And in order to understand what methods and what needs to be studied,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
we will analyze three aspects, three topics today.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
The process of management research,

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
we will look at the principles, stages, approaches to conducting management research.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
We will talk about qualitative and quantitative methods,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
which are adopted in management research,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
but we will focus on qualitative research.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Quantitative research will be told to you in an additional lecture.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
And we will finish today's video course with questions of ethics.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
Ethics of relations, ethics of conducting management research,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
research in business,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
because most researches, one way or another,

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
affect people working in organizations, companies, and so on.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
It is very important to see how the rights of those who participate in research are observed,

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
and how to build your research in such a way that these rights are not violated.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
In business, one way or another,

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
internal and external research is conducted almost daily and hourly.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Internal means inside your organization,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
external means for third-party organizations,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
when you are a consultant.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
The conducted research requires recording of the obtained data,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
making reports, analysis of the results,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
and suggestions, recommendations, and so on.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
In order to carry out this process correctly,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
in order to get reliable, valid data,

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
it is necessary to understand very well what the research process is,

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
and what are the good skills that I will try to tell you,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
if not to instill, at least to tell you,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
what skills are inherent in good research.

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
And, of course, it is necessary to know about the key methods of conducting research.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
What are the goals and tasks of this course?

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
First of all, we will talk about nature and the purpose of management research.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
We will analyze the structure of management research,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
what is its content.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
The main attention will be paid to methodology and methods of conducting research,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
as I said, with an emphasis on the methods of qualitative research.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
The word qualitative is taken in quotation marks.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
This does not mean that quantitative research can be called unqualified.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Qualitative means collecting data by informal methods.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
The data that does not carry a numerical value.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
And then ethical aspects of behavior.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
What is management research, if we talk about its nature?

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
This is a methodical assessment of the functional zones of an organization.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
What zones?

04:19.000 --> 04:27.000
Marketing, finance, accounting and management of staff, and so on.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
In each of these areas, many studies can be conducted.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
What is this study for?

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
In order to identify strategically strong and weak sides.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
The word strategically is important here.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Why?

04:45.000 --> 04:57.000
Because only by working for the future can we move forward in conditions of a highly competitive environment.

04:57.000 --> 05:06.000
Management research is aimed at helping to solve difficult situations,

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
and sometimes to take advantage of the opportunity that has suddenly opened up.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
Because the problem, as we will see with you later, does not always mean something bad in your organization.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Very often this is an opportunity.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
If we talk about what research in business and management is,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
then we need to emphasize the following two aspects.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Research in business must be systematic.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
What does it mean to be systematic?

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
This means not to rely on assumptions and guesses,

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
but only on logically identified interconnections and logical constructions.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
What does it mean to be clear?

06:02.000 --> 06:12.000
Research can only be recognized as research if it gives an increase in some knowledge.

06:12.000 --> 06:20.000
In business, this is knowledge about the business itself and the management of this business.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
In fact, there is no standard definition of what research is.

06:28.000 --> 06:42.000
Nevertheless, a number of scientists say that research can be called a process that combines the following three aspects.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
A method, personal or commercial benefit, and practical significance.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
What does a method mean?

06:50.000 --> 07:02.000
A method is a method by which people engaged in research combine the knowledge gained in different disciplines

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
and the experience gained in practice to conduct this research.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Commercial and personal benefit.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Unlike fundamental research, which we will talk about a little later,

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
research in business can only be undertaken when it is beneficial.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Is it beneficial for the manager personally, for the researcher personally,

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
or is it beneficial for the company or organization as a whole?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Practical significance.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
It comes from above.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
People are very busy in business.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
They have no time to spend on research for the sake of research.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
Only the research that will bring them a visible, real income,

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
a profitable business, an improvement in the company's situation,

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
a decrease in the flow of personnel, and so on.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Only this research will be recognized as practically significant.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
And you, as a researcher, will be able to get permission for it.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
And you will need permission because research is a costly event,

08:31.000 --> 08:39.000
and it is costly not only in terms of money, but also in terms of time, emotions, and so on.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
The concept of managerial research is the next aspect that we should consider.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
Research is a process of setting a question and conducting an investigation.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
The question may be different.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
One question will be about a very narrow topic,

09:01.000 --> 09:10.000
for example, why employees of one of the departments of the company are regularly late for work.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
The problem may be very large.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
Let's say the demand for the company's products has decreased.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
The question arises, why has it decreased, and we need to deal with this issue.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
Or maybe it will happen that one of the employees made a mistake,

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
but this mistake led to the discovery of new knowledge,

09:40.000 --> 09:48.000
and a lot of new products and processes have been created based on mistakes.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Research should be systematic and methodical.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
What does it mean to be systematic?

09:54.000 --> 10:03.000
That is, the methods, approaches, and philosophy that you use should become one and whole,

10:03.000 --> 10:12.000
and fully respond to the definition of the system as an economic category.

10:12.000 --> 10:23.000
All elements should be interconnected, dependent, and should definitely have an integration effect.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Research should be methodical.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
You should choose and prove the right methods based on the study of literature,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
secondary sources of information,

10:35.000 --> 10:50.000
and use them to get reliable results of your research.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
The last aspect, which is indicated in the slide, is very important.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Research expands and multiplies knowledge.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
Research that does not expand and multiply knowledge cannot be recognized as such,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
at least in business.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
What does it mean to multiply and expand knowledge?

11:13.000 --> 11:23.000
Let's say you consider the motivation of the sales department employees to increase the volume of sales.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Is there a theory of motivation of such employees?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Yes, there is.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
But this is a general theory.

11:30.000 --> 11:41.000
It should be adapted to the people, to the situation that is directly in your company.

11:42.000 --> 11:54.000
In this case, in business, you will multiply knowledge for your organization, for your management, and for your company.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
And the last thesis.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Research expands and multiplies knowledge.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
We have already talked a little about this.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Research should definitely multiply knowledge.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
Knowledge for a specific organization, for a specific situation, for specific people.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Otherwise, the research is left as it is.

12:17.000 --> 12:28.000
What are the goals of management research or other research, both in business and in academic sciences?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Review and generalization of existing knowledge.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
This goal can have an independent meaning, but most often in fundamental sciences.

12:39.000 --> 12:47.000
It is meant that the researcher studies the literature, secondary sources of information,

12:47.000 --> 12:56.000
and forms an idea about the subject of study, about what was done before it,

12:56.000 --> 13:09.000
and finds those holes, not joints in the literature they have studied, on which he can focus his attention.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
But most often, since we are talking about research in business,

13:14.000 --> 13:23.000
a review and generalization of existing knowledge is the first stage of any research.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Before starting your own research,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
each researcher must make sure that he does not invent a bicycle,

13:31.000 --> 13:40.000
but builds his research on the basis of already accumulated knowledge and practical experience.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
The second goal is to study some existing problems and situations.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
This is practically typical for any research.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
To solve the problem, of course.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Otherwise, why do you need to do research?

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Although the problem can be solved intuitively, and there are methods and approaches,

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
you will hear about this in other disciplines of management decisions,

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
but the intuitive approach has its weak points,

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
and the right intuitive solutions can be adopted by almost one person.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Research and analysis of general issues.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
Yes, this can also be an independent research,

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
or it can be done within the framework of research in business.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
Design or creation of a new process or a new system.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
In the modern world, this is a very relevant goal for research,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
because we live very, very fast,

14:51.000 --> 14:59.000
and the creation of new products requires spending almost every day,

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
to be at least one step ahead of your competitors.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Explanation of a new phenomenon.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
Of course, the phenomenological approach to the study of the situation is very important,

15:16.000 --> 15:25.000
and a new phenomenon must be studied in order to be used in a profitable way.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Generating new knowledge.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
This is typical for any research, to a greater or lesser extent.

15:33.000 --> 15:43.000
As we have already said, in business, new knowledge usually belongs to the organization,

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
the company in which this knowledge was generated, and it is practically significant for it.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
In fundamental sciences, the generation of new knowledge has a universal value.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
And the last thesis is a combination of several of the above goals.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
As a rule, this is most often found in business research.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
That is, almost any researcher should start with a review and generalization of existing knowledge,

16:16.000 --> 16:26.000
do research on the existing situation or solve the problem using analysis and synthesis

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
in order to generate new knowledge or explain a particular phenomenon,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
a particular phenomenon that was discovered in his company.

16:38.000 --> 16:48.000
But in order to conduct a research, you need a certain preparation and, of course, certain qualities are needed.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Let's start with persistence.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
What does a researcher need to be persistent for?

16:53.000 --> 17:04.000
First of all, in order to prove the necessity and usefulness of conducting a research,

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
to prove it to the direct supervisor, to prove it to the board of directors, and so on.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
But persistence is also needed at the stage of conducting your own research,

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
because the research process is not a very simple action.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
Very often, a researcher comes across problems already within the research.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
Very often, he needs to give up the data he has received, he needs to go back again and again.

17:35.000 --> 17:42.000
It may be a primitive example, but it is very similar to knitting a blouse, for example.

17:43.000 --> 17:50.000
You have finished knitting the sleeve, and it turned out that the right one is shorter than the left one, and you need to dissolve it.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
The same is true in research.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Very often, it is a return-to-request process.

17:55.000 --> 18:03.000
And from here, of course, a researcher needs persistence to overcome all these difficulties, and so on.

18:03.000 --> 18:11.000
As for motivation, here you need to note two main points.

18:11.000 --> 18:18.000
You can motivate a person with a gingerbread, or you can motivate him with a punishment.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
As a rule, motivating with a gingerbread is more common in the modern world.

18:24.000 --> 18:32.000
Motivation can be expressed in the fact that the researcher is directly interested in the results of the research,

18:32.000 --> 18:41.000
and that the data he has received will allow him to improve his position, and so on.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
He can show himself to the management.

18:43.000 --> 18:52.000
If the manager is interested in the results of the research, then the results can motivate the manager.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
But very often, motivation is also associated with fear.

18:57.000 --> 19:11.000
If you assume that you can lose your position as a manager, then you will conduct the research and collect data with all your attention.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
There are also some underlying facts here, of course, that such motivation can lead to falsification of data,

19:19.000 --> 19:30.000
which leads to the fact that the researcher is trying to match the results to what he assumes his direct customer would like to hear,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
whom we call the owner of the problem.

19:33.000 --> 19:53.000
If we go back to the early years of our Soviet life, we know that many of the most important discoveries that served the benefit of our country were made in fear of losing their lives.

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
I do not want to praise all the other personal qualities listed in the second table.

20:00.000 --> 20:13.000
Of course, creativity is necessary, flexibility is very important for a researcher, but persistence and perseverance are very important components.

20:13.000 --> 20:20.000
Moreover, there is an opinion that a creative person is not always persistent.

20:20.000 --> 20:31.000
Now it's time to talk about the types of research that can be done, that is, to classify them.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Classification can be as much as you select the classification features.

20:37.000 --> 20:47.000
In this case, we classify them according to the goals, process, logic of the research and the result of the research.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
If we talk about the classification feature, the goals of the study are highlighted by the following types of research.

20:56.000 --> 21:04.000
Studying, descriptive, analytical or explanatory, it is sometimes called, and prognostic.

21:04.000 --> 21:14.000
If we talk about the process, then it is a qualitative or quantitative approach to collecting data.

21:14.000 --> 21:28.000
If we talk about the logic of the process, then it is a deductive or inductive approach, that is, either a deductive approach from the general to the private,

21:28.000 --> 21:40.000
or an inductive approach to collecting private facts in order to make a generalization or even create a theory.

21:40.000 --> 21:48.000
As for the result, there are two types of research, applied and fundamental.

21:48.000 --> 21:55.000
Applied research is the case that we are talking about, it is a business.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Fundamental research is, as a rule, academic science.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
And then we will talk in detail about each of these types.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
The study type.

22:06.000 --> 22:14.000
As a rule, this research is undertaken at the initial stages of the study,

22:14.000 --> 22:24.000
when the researcher has practically no or very little data on the subject, phenomenon, event, and so on.

22:24.000 --> 22:31.000
The purpose of this research, as you can see, is the search for ways, ideas, and the promotion of hypotheses.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
Here is an example of a situation when this type of research is needed.

22:36.000 --> 22:46.000
There was a need to increase the motivation of employees, in this case, employees in the department,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
with the subsequent increase in their productivity.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
In fact, having conducted an interview with employees in the department or in the company,

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
it may be understood, what hypothesis can be expressed?

23:00.000 --> 23:09.000
That the productivity of the labor can increase if, well, let's say, the office is re-planned.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
What is a hypothesis?

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
We have met this word, and it is very important.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
In Greek, it is the basis of assumptions.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
But the hypothesis and the assumption are somewhat different from each other.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
You have two definitions of the hypothesis.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
The first is an assumption about the pattern of some phenomenon,

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
or an explanation option if there is a lack of information.

23:37.000 --> 23:46.000
This is an assumption formulated for testing empirically, that is, by experience.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
And the assumption is a statement about an idea that can be observed.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
But when we make one or another assumption,

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
in principle, we do not claim to check this assumption.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
The hypothesis in business research should only be promoted

24:09.000 --> 24:17.000
which can be checked one way or another, by certain methods and methods.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
The requirement for a hypothesis should take into account the known laws

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
and should not be adjusted to them in any way.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I have already voiced the second thesis.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
The hypothesis should be principally verifiable.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
What should be noted here?

24:33.000 --> 24:42.000
Not all hypotheses can be verified at once, based on the knowledge of the researcher.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
Therefore, hypotheses that cannot be verified at the moment should not be verified at once.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
They should be put aside.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
But they can be returned when new knowledge, new information,

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
new tools for checking this hypothesis appear.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
And the hypothesis should, of course, be based on facts.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
If you ask to give an example of a hypothesis,

25:11.000 --> 25:19.000
most often the construction of a hypothesis is laid out in a formula.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
What happens if?

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
If we increase the duration of the working day,

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
then most likely our young mothers will quit their jobs.

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
This hypothesis is formulated in a minor tone, in a negative meaning.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
The practice of applying hypotheses, especially in Western business schools,

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
suggests that it is better to formulate hypotheses in a positive sense.

25:53.000 --> 26:00.000
If we give mothers an opportunity to leave work an hour earlier,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
without reducing their salary,

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
their productivity will certainly increase.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
This does not mean that the hypothesis should always be in this construction.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
The theory of hypotheses is quite large, it is described very well in the literature.

26:15.000 --> 26:23.000
If this question interests you, you can ask this question in addition.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
The next type of research is descriptive.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
Already from this title it is clear that it describes some phenomena

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
in the way they exist.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
It is used in cases when you need to give an additional characteristic

26:42.000 --> 26:52.000
or get additional information on private issues or elements of the problem.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
An example of the situation is described in the description of ways to encourage employees

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
and methods used to evaluate their performance.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
If you compare it with the previous situation,

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
you will understand that this can be the next stage in the same research.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
In the first case, you have found approaches, ideas, etc.

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
Here you describe ways to encourage existing in your organization

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
and what principles exist.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
The next type of research is analytical or explanatory.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
As already clear from the title, it aims to understand the phenomenon

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
that was described earlier.

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
It further reveals the causes of the relationship in this phenomenon.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
An example of the situation is the analysis of the interdependence

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
on the encouragement of labor productivity.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
We have already described them, now we need to analyze them.

27:55.000 --> 28:03.000
Based on the analysis, it is possible to make a forecast.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
The next type of research is forecast based on the analysis.

28:09.000 --> 28:17.000
It aims to make a prediction, a forecast for the future.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
It makes an assumption of how labor productivity will change

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
if the components of the compensation package of employees change.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
If you put all the examples of the situation in one row,

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
you will see that they can be the stages of one big research.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
In fact, the researcher can be limited to either the study

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
or the explanatory stage, or he can complete it.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
Next, we talked about the classification sign of the process.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
The process is characterized by quantitative and qualitative approaches

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
to conducting research.

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
Quantitative methods differ in that the researcher receives

29:12.000 --> 29:20.000
some numerical information that can be statistically processed.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
The questions of the research when conducting quantitative research

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
usually answer the question of how much.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
How many additional employees do you need to hire

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
to be able to complete the work in time?

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
The characteristics of qualitative research are listed on the slide.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
If we talk about quantitative methods,

29:48.000 --> 29:56.000
we should answer that quantitative methods in business

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
are often based on surveys, surveys and structured interviews,

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
which we will talk about later.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
The characteristic feature of quantitative methods is

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
that the analysis is separated from the data collection.

30:17.000 --> 30:23.000
That is, first comes the data collection, and then the analysis.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
You will have a separate lecture course on quantitative methods,

30:28.000 --> 30:34.000
so I will not talk much about this topic.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Qualitative methods of research are based on understanding,

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
explanation and interpretation of empirical data.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
They answer the questions of what, how and why.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
What needs to be done to increase the productivity of labor?

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
Why is the percentage of absence of unemployment

30:58.000 --> 31:06.000
so high in the first place?

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
There are many qualitative methods.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
Among them are unstructured and semi-structured interviews,

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
group interviews, which we call focus groups,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
different types of observations,

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
and even the use of a researcher as an object.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
If we talk about the logic of the process,

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
deductive and inductive approaches are highlighted here.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
Induction and deduction are equal opportunities

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
when conducting research in business.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
When and how to choose the logic of research?

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
Induction is very often used in business.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
What is it?

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
You have collected the facts and tried to make a generalization

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
based on these facts.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
This is an inductive approach.

32:10.000 --> 32:19.000
A deduction is when you look for evidence based on your theory.

32:19.000 --> 32:25.000
Remember Sherlock Holmes, who used this deductive method.

32:25.000 --> 32:35.000
Induction is very useful to check the hypotheses you built earlier.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
The last one is the application and fundamental research.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
I won't dwell on this too much.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I think you understand it.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I'll emphasize it again.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
The application research is what a researcher does in business.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
Fundamental research is not what a business does,

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
but it can be a sponsor of a fundamental research.

33:04.000 --> 33:10.000
Then you can check whether the money was used for a purpose.

33:10.000 --> 33:17.000
However, you can check it only after a few decades.

33:17.000 --> 33:24.000
The first researches in the field of building seismic stability

33:24.000 --> 33:31.000
are based on the theory of falling dominoes.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
It was done by enthusiasts.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
You probably saw how they put the dominoes on the edge one by one,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
pushed one and everyone fell.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
When we talk about data collection,

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
we should highlight two terms.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
These are primary or field researches.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
It is an independent collection of information

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
by any acceptable and justified method.

34:04.000 --> 34:12.000
However, this method does not include data collected by someone else.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
Secondary researches are what we talked about

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
when we talked about the goals of management researches.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
It is to summarize the knowledge gained earlier.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
Secondary researches are a review of literature,

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
published reports, and so on.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I should make a clarification here.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
For Russian practice, this is a new trend

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
of highlighting primary and secondary researches.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
Most often, we call it a literary review.

34:49.000 --> 34:57.000
In Western practice, primary researches are an absolutely necessary component of any research.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
Secondary researches are also necessary,

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
but they are separate from the literary review.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
In Russian understanding, a literary review should consist of two parts.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
A review of theory and a review of practice.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Secondary researches are a review of reports,

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
publications about previous researches,

35:23.000 --> 35:32.000
data analysis of annual reports, articles,

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
articles of various conferences, and so on.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
These are materials posted on the pages of magazines, websites,

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
and so on.

35:47.000 --> 35:53.000
Sometimes, secondary researches can have an independent meaning.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
And this will be called a cabinet research.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
It is not always necessary to conduct researches within the organization.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
But in order to prepare, for example, a proposal for a research,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
or to make a market analysis,

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
or to find a niche in the market,

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
it is quite possible to conduct a cabinet research.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
This is what is called a desk research in English.

36:19.000 --> 36:30.000
But most often, secondary researches are a starting point for conducting your own research.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
And now we have come close to the point of considering

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
what is the sequence of the research process.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
It is shown on the slide.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
There are seven stages,

36:43.000 --> 36:54.000
but this does not mean that the researches should be conducted strictly in the order they are listed here.

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
Very often, researches can start from another stage.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
Of course, you will not be able to make a data analysis earlier than you have already collected them.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
But the topic of the research and the formulation of the problem

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
often have to be changed during the course of the research.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
As new knowledge is revealed,

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
as additional information appears,

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
then everything has to be started from the beginning.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
Here, persistence and perseverance are needed.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
Nevertheless, you still need to start with the choice of the topic.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
What are the principles of the choice of the topic?

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
First of all, the researcher must have the information

37:46.000 --> 37:55.000
or have the ability to get this information from people who have the problem.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
If a person does not have the information,

37:59.000 --> 38:05.000
then it is almost impossible to formulate the topic of the research.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Or rather, it can be done,

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
but the research will then go into a deadlock.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
It will not have practical significance.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
The possession of information is a very important aspect

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
at the initial stage of the research.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
And access to information is also a very important aspect.

38:28.000 --> 38:35.000
Regardless of whether you work in a Russian company or in a company with a foreign management,

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
you have a certain level of access to information.

38:40.000 --> 38:48.000
If you are trying to explore the area where you have no access,

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
then most likely your research will fail.

38:54.000 --> 39:00.000
Unfortunately, there are cases when a researcher,

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
starting or only planning the research,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
turns to the management,

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
putting it in the knowledge of the need to conduct the research,

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
and the researcher is limited in information.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
There is a concept of a commercial secret,

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
which is not always used in a justified way.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Therefore, before you formulate the topic,

39:27.000 --> 39:33.000
think about how realistic this topic will be for you to explore.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
The next thesis is also very important.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
The topic should be limited to one area of management.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
In other words, the topic should not be very general.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
One of the standard mistakes when choosing a topic,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
a researcher's mistake,

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
is that he wants to plow a huge field,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
to learn both this and that.

40:02.000 --> 40:10.000
But, as a rule, such research is characterized as superficial,

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
because any research is spent on resources,

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
on time, financial or other aspects.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
Therefore, it is advisable to conduct research in a narrow direction,

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
either in marketing or finance.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
But this does not mean that you need to explore a multi-aspect area.

40:35.000 --> 40:43.000
It is better to work on a narrow topic, but in depth and detail.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
And the last thing to discuss is the thesis of the subject's feasibility.

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
The less feasible the topic is, the more difficult it will be to conduct research.

40:54.000 --> 41:00.000
The most difficult research to conduct in areas such as satisfaction,

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
or the motivation of the consumers or employees,

41:04.000 --> 41:11.000
the motivation of the sales staff, and so on.

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
Although this does not mean that you should not explore these topics,

41:16.000 --> 41:22.000
but you should remember that it is difficult and calculate your strengths.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Now let's move on to the consideration of conceptual foundations.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
First of all, let's talk about the formulation of problems.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
In Greek, a problem is a barrier, a difficulty, a task.

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
That is, any uncertainty or contradiction that arose in the process of learning

41:42.000 --> 41:49.000
and which cannot be eliminated within the framework of existing knowledge.

41:49.000 --> 41:56.000
First of all, you need to determine what you need to establish,

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
what are the goals, tasks, what are the causes of the problems,

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
what problems and difficulties can be accompanied by the main problem, and so on.

42:07.000 --> 42:14.000
There are three main categories of problems, corrective, progressive, and creative.

42:14.000 --> 42:21.000
Corrective problems are the problems that we call a bad situation.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
That is, you need to change something.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
Let's say the productivity of labor has sharply decreased,

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
the sales of a product on the market have sharply decreased, and so on.

42:34.000 --> 42:45.000
You need a certain corrective action, a managerial decision to solve this problem.

42:45.000 --> 42:55.000
Progressive problems are those that can be called situations when, in general, nothing bad has happened yet,

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
but there is no progress.

43:00.000 --> 43:05.000
Very often, such a category of problems arises at the stage,

43:05.000 --> 43:13.000
if we talk about the stages of the life cycle of an organization or the stages of the life cycle of a product,

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
at the stage of maturity.

43:15.000 --> 43:24.000
The product is sold well, and it has a lot of buyers, but the competitors do not sleep.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
You need to undertake something to make a decisive step.

43:30.000 --> 43:37.000
Therefore, we say that a situation has arisen that needs to be improved.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
It is not bad, but it needs to be made even better.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
And the creative problems are the creation of a new product, the creation of a new process.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
And when we talk about creating a new product, it does not mean that you need to invent something completely new.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
In the modern world, this is almost impossible, with very few exceptions.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
In fact, we will not go into the theory of creating a new product.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
Nevertheless, you can give the product some distinctive properties,

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
different from what the competitor offers, and create, offer something new.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
This is if we talk about marketing.

44:19.000 --> 44:29.000
But creative problems can arise not only in the field of marketing, but also in finance, management, and so on.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
The main characteristics of problems.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
First of all, we are talking about the essence or content of the problem.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
This is a very difficult aspect.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
You need to understand what the problem is.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
And this is just at first glance.

44:47.000 --> 44:57.000
Because very often the problem that is visible, the one that lies on the surface, is not really a problem,

44:57.000 --> 45:05.000
but is only a consequence of deeper processes, deeper difficulties in the organization.

45:06.000 --> 45:14.000
And therefore, at the stage of formulating the problem, a very good elaboration is needed.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Hypothesis, assumptions.

45:16.000 --> 45:28.000
It must be taken into account that the study is necessary in order to make the correct formulation of the problem.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
The next characteristic is the organizational and physical location of the problem.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
This is a very important aspect.

45:38.000 --> 45:48.000
To understand whether the problem is only a separate unit of the company, or is it a problem of the organization as a whole.

45:48.000 --> 45:59.000
Is it a problem of the relationship between people, colleagues at work, or is it a problem of the relationship between subordinates and management?

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
Is this problem inside the organization, or is it caused by external influences?

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
The next aspect is the ownership of the problem.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Who is the owner of the problem?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
As a rule, it is the manager.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
It does not mean that it is a top manager.

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
The manager can be of the middle class, and so on.

46:24.000 --> 46:30.000
That is, a person who is interested in solving this problem.

46:30.000 --> 46:37.000
Who will get a certain benefit from the fact that this problem will be solved.

46:38.000 --> 46:45.000
And has certain official powers to solve this problem.

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
The absolute relative value as a characteristic of the problem is quite simple.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
Here you need to decide whether you need absolute numbers.

46:56.000 --> 47:05.000
That is, let's say, measure how much time is spent by the employee unproductively.

47:05.000 --> 47:14.000
By the way, the research conducted in the West showed that, for example, the work of a manager is often unproductive.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Or you will need relative values.

47:18.000 --> 47:27.000
When you need to give the characteristics of people, the characteristics of the atmosphere in the team, let's say.

47:27.000 --> 47:33.000
That is, those categories that cannot be expressed in numerical values.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
And you need to give qualitative descriptive characteristics.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
And the last thing that must be taken into account is the time perspective.

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
Any research is limited by the time resource.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
Who releases this resource?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
It can be circumstances.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
It can be the management.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
It can be the researcher's own capabilities.

48:03.000 --> 48:14.000
And when considering the time perspective in the process of formulating a problem, you need to take into account the logic of the process you will be studying.

48:15.000 --> 48:25.000
The practice shows that the deductive approach requires much more time to analyze the information already available.

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
This is a review of theories and a review of secondary sources of information.

48:30.000 --> 48:36.000
But the research itself can be conducted in rather short periods.

48:36.000 --> 48:49.000
While the inductive approach, due to the fact that there may be much less information on the problem being studied, takes less time.

48:49.000 --> 48:57.000
But the collection of factual material can take a long time.

48:58.000 --> 49:14.000
Especially if, returning to the organization of the problem, if this problem is not local, but a problem of a large company that has a large number of offices far from each other, and so on.

49:14.000 --> 49:24.000
That is, when formulating a problem, you must think about how much time you have to solve this problem.

49:24.000 --> 49:32.000
In addition, when we talk about the time perspective, we must also pay attention to such aspects.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
That is, ask yourself questions.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
How long has this problem been around?

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
How often does it happen in the organization?

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
How many people have already come to terms with this problem?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And so on.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.000
And so much, because this is also very important for subsequent analysis.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Let's move on to the next aspects.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
The reasons for the problem.

49:53.000 --> 50:08.000
Since the problem will determine the entire further strategy of research and scientific research, it is necessary to determine what forces and factors cause this problem.

50:08.000 --> 50:16.000
It should be borne in mind that the real causes of the problem may not be those that are visible on the surface.

50:16.000 --> 50:30.000
It is imperative to conduct a study to examine, to sort out all the many factors that are somehow related to the problem.

50:30.000 --> 50:46.000
A researcher can formulate a problem only when he or she literally feels, understands where the line between knowledge and ignorance about the subject of the study is.

50:46.000 --> 50:56.000
Where did the imperceptible change that caused the situation occur?

50:56.000 --> 51:04.000
A clearly formulated problem, a topic of research is a key to the success of the entire study.

51:04.000 --> 51:14.000
Because if the starting point is chosen incorrectly, then the entire study can be taken almost in vain.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
Why do we talk so much about the problem?

51:18.000 --> 51:26.000
Because there are and are described many difficulties and problems in identifying them.

51:26.000 --> 51:33.000
And the most important of them is the acceptance of symptoms for the problem.

51:33.000 --> 51:44.000
Let's assume that the management encountered a problem of the absence of employees in May at their workplace.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Everyone has a hospitalization list.

51:46.000 --> 51:52.000
In one year in May there are no employees at work, in another year in May there are no employees.

51:52.000 --> 52:00.000
We can assume that the body is weakened, people are tired, want to go on vacation, and therefore are ill.

52:01.000 --> 52:14.000
As one of the studies showed, the reason for this problem was that in May there were football championships in this city.

52:14.000 --> 52:23.000
And the employees agreed who went to the hospital and who stayed to work.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
But in order to identify this, an internal study had to be conducted.

52:29.000 --> 52:42.000
This team was introduced by a secret internal observer who entered into trust and thus allowed to identify the cause of such a problem.

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
The next difficulty is a biased opinion about the causes of the problems.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
A biased opinion and sometimes hasty solutions.

52:52.000 --> 53:02.000
Very often researchers make a mistake when they talk about problems, but in fact they are talking about solutions.

53:02.000 --> 53:09.000
Or they have a clear opinion that the cause of the problem is that.

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
Responsible managers often make mistakes.

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
Here, sometimes, there is a so-called Pareto law.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
Being specialists in one thing, they consider themselves specialists in everything.

53:27.000 --> 53:35.000
And very often the owner of the problem says, I know for sure that this is our problem.

53:35.000 --> 53:46.000
And he does not want any research and does not listen to those who tell him, express another point of view.

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
The next problem is a view of the problem only from one technical point of view.

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
This is a common but not very common phenomenon.

53:57.000 --> 54:07.000
Although, if this is the case, then it will cause a lot of problems in the future.

54:07.000 --> 54:25.000
Because not taking into account the human factor, behavioral reactions, etc., this means to combine, and sometimes distort, the results of the study.

54:25.000 --> 54:45.000
The next difficulty is ignoring how the problem is perceived in different parts of the organization, in different divisions, at different levels of management, in different regional branches, etc.

54:46.000 --> 54:55.000
This is also a very well-described phenomenon, and we need to listen to it.

54:55.000 --> 55:01.000
What does it mean that in different parts of the organization the problem can be perceived in different ways?

55:01.000 --> 55:10.000
Let's say, in one department there is a purely female team, and in another purely male.

55:11.000 --> 55:24.000
And to perceive the problem, let's say, the need to work overtime, of course, in these divisions will be perceived differently.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
And this needs to be taken into account.

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
And the next aspect is a very important, unfinished diagnosis of the problem.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
Unfortunately, it happens very, very often.

55:36.000 --> 55:51.000
Having received some initial data, a hasty conclusion is made that these are the causes of the problem, let's get rid of them, and all this will end.

55:51.000 --> 56:12.000
In your workbook, you have a very short version of an example of an unfinished, fortunately, happily completed problem, but at the initial stage, when the decision was made, this diagnosis was not completed.

56:12.000 --> 56:32.000
If the solution to the problem was as it was initially seen, then this could certainly lead to complicating interpersonal relations in the team, or even to a strike at this enterprise.

56:32.000 --> 56:52.000
And as it turned out, you probably have already read, it turned out not in people and not in their desire to sabotage the work, but in the fact that the metal that came for the blanks had other technical characteristics.

56:52.000 --> 57:00.000
And people were completely innocent that they produced defective products.

57:00.000 --> 57:12.000
When formulating a problem, you must take into account that some aspects can be associated with the problem.

57:12.000 --> 57:30.000
First of all, you need to study the factors that can aggravate or soften the problem, but are not its direct causes.

57:30.000 --> 57:44.000
Next, it is very important to understand that when solving one problem, other problems may arise. This is a very common situation.

57:44.000 --> 58:00.000
Let's say you solved the problem of providing an extra day off for mothers with young children. Have you solved the problem? You have solved the problem.

58:00.000 --> 58:16.000
And what other problems can arise in this regard? Discontent of those who may have elderly parents who also need time off, but they were not given such an opportunity.

58:16.000 --> 58:40.000
That is, you must understand that the system is very multifaceted and make hypotheses, make predictions about what other problems may arise in connection with the decision-making and how to reduce their negative impact.

58:40.000 --> 58:58.000
The next thesis also concerns the elimination of some difficulties, and new ones arise immediately. They are a little connected to each other, but these difficulties are not necessarily of a negative nature.

58:58.000 --> 59:10.000
If we have solved the problem of product modernization, we have solved the difficulties. But what additional difficulties do we have?

59:10.000 --> 59:31.000
It is quite possible that the buyer is not ready for this product, and we need to make additional efforts to explain to the buyer what the product has become better for him. And these are additional costs, additional resources.

59:32.000 --> 59:46.000
There are many examples of this. If you look at your practical and even personal life, you will find many confirmations and examples.

59:46.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And, accordingly, when you think about the formulation of the problem, you need to assess your ability, your organizational ability to solve this problem.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:16.000
First of all, you need to look at the material and financial resources that you have, or that the customer, the owner of this problem, has.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:34.000
The next aspect is that you need to assess your technical qualification. How much do you know about the methods that can be used to solve the problem?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Are there people who can help you solve this problem? The time factor, we have already talked about it, the time factor is very important, but I will not repeat myself, we have already talked a little about it.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:05.000
The next aspect is new for us, it is the experience of organization in solving other problems. This experience can help the researcher to determine the solution to this existing problem.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:25.000
If you have such experience, it is quite possible to make some analogies, to use the developments, the methods adapted for organization that will simplify the solution of the task.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:40.000
The next aspect is that the ability to solve the problem is not in the order of importance, they are all important, but the attitude of the employees to the problem is very important.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.000
The employees can treat this problem indifferently, which is not a problem for them, on the one hand.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:06.000
On the other hand, employees can already get along with this problem so much that it is easier for them to live in this problem situation than to go through some changes that they will need to get used to.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Moreover, people often treat the investigation with distrust. The human psyche is such that if something is investigated, then no matter how bad it is, no matter how much someone has to be fired from work,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:47.000
if it suddenly turns out that we can do this work not three of us, but together, and so on. This issue needs to be studied very well.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We have formulated the problem. What are the directions of further actions? And then you need to collect information, collect it carefully, systematically and unpretentiously.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:16.000
All the collected information must be registered. What type of registration do you prefer? This will tell you about your research and your technical capabilities.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It can be recording, it can be audio recording, it can be video recording. But one way or another, all the information must be recorded in the most thorough way and preserved, I would say, not even until the end of the investigation, but for a long enough time after it.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Because very often there is a need to go back to the recordings, analyze them again, look at these results again. And as you collect information, you need to analyze it.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Especially when it comes to quality data analysis. We said that the analysis of quantitative data is usually done after the information has been collected, but not always.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Both qualitative and quantitative data must be analyzed as they are collected. For what? To understand whether you are going in the wrong direction in your research,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:55.000
whether you need to make a right turn, or accelerate, or maybe stop this process altogether and express a new idea, formulate a new problem and move in a completely different direction.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:07.000
And these data you have collected is what we call the data of the initial investigation. As we said before.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that all the data must be collected thoroughly, it must be systematized as it is collected, and your attitude towards the investigation must be unbiased.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:40.000
You must be free from the influence of people involved in the investigation, events that accompany your research, and so on.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:58.000
At the end of this topic, we will look at what an object is and what a subject of research is. An object is what the subject of research is focused on.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:18.000
It is very important that the object may be one, and there may be several subjects for research. The subject of research is always within the field of research, within its boundaries, within a certain aspect of the study.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:33.000
To make it clear, I will give you a very simple and accessible example. Let's say you have a research question.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Have the apples ripened? What will be the subject and what will be the field of research? It depends on the specific point of the problem.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:07:08.000
If you want to know whether the apples have ripened on a specific apple tree, let's say, in Antonovka, then the object of research will be an apple tree, and the subject of research will be a specific apple on this tree.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:27.000
If you are interested in whether the apples have ripened in a garden, then the object of research will be a fruit garden, an apple garden, and the subject of research will be a separate tree, an apple tree.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:46.000
In both cases, you will need to make a choice. In the first case, the general combination will be all the apples on the tree in Antonovka. In the second case, the general combination will be all the trees in the garden.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Returning to the apple tree, you cannot bite every apple on the tree. You will most likely try one apple from the south, one from the north, one from the top, one from the bottom branches, and then you will be able to make a conclusion.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Has Antonovka ripened on this tree? In the case of a garden, you will need to choose the trees on which you will actually check. And based on the check of the ripeness of the apples on the separate trees, you will conclude that the apples in the garden have ripened.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:50.000
But if not only apples grow in your garden, but also other fruit trees, then there will be several subjects for research in the garden. You will check whether the apples, pears, plums, and so on have ripened.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Sorry for the simplification, but this is a fairly obvious example. Let's move on to more serious things. An example from a practically protected dissertation.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The topic of the dissertation is presented on the slide. The concept of teleworking as a new form of staff management. What is teleworking? This is the work of an employee at home.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Let's not say at home, he can work anywhere, but the main thing is that he does not need to come to the office. The principles of teleworking are well described. If someone is interested, this is a form of organization of work, especially I turn to employers.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:49.000
This greatly saves company resources, but there are also certain difficulties in managing such people.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:10:06.000
As part of this dissertation, the subject of research was the organization of virtual labor in Russia. For Russia, this is not yet a very characteristic phenomenon. And the existing staff management systems in such organizations.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:25.000
The subject of the dissertation was the phenomenon of teleworking as a form of employment and as a new form of staff management.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:38.000
This is a choice of the philosophy of research. We said that we can have different approaches, inductive and deductive, but we have not yet talked about philosophy.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:58.000
The dissertation highlights two types of philosophical approaches to research. This can be positivism, which can be adequately characterized by the quote given above. The social world exists externally, and its properties must be measured by objective measures.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And as an antithesis, this is phenomenology, a philosophical approach. It fits very well with our topic of research in business. The world and reality are not objective and do not exist externally. They are socially organized and people make sense of them.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:47.000
We say that every situation is unique. A researcher, being in the same business environment as his colleagues, is free to influence people, events, circumstances, etc.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:57.000
From the point of view of positivism, from the point of view of phenomenology, the data collection structure can be quantitative and qualitative.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:13.000
The following slide shows examples of qualitative positivism. This is a medical diagnosis. What does a doctor do when you come to him for the first time?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:41.000
First, he asks you to tell him what you feel. You don't bet, do you? Although, they do. A man I know comes to the doctor and says, I have a heartache, I have tachycardia. And the doctor says, first tell me what you feel, and then I will diagnose you.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:13:03.000
In this case, the doctor acts as a positivist, a positivist researcher. Why? Because he is completely independent of the patient. It is quite possible that this is why doctors, with very rare exceptions, choose to treat their loved ones.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Quantitative positivism is not only a collection of financial results. We can make a quantitative diagnosis in medicine, see how much hemoglobin is in the blood, how much cholesterol is in it, etc.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:30.000
For business, of course, both quantitative and qualitative phenomenology are more typical. Quantitative phenomenology is surveys, surveys with different purposes.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Qualitative phenomenology is various types of interviews, focus groups, comparisons, etc.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Now we need to decide on methods of organization of research. We have already discussed all of this with you, so we will just emphasize the topic of research.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Depending on the amount of information on this problem, if you have a lot of sources of literature, the problem is well described, it is quite possible that you will choose a deductive approach to the organization of your research and will look for the points that are characteristic of your organization.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:53.000
If there is very little information on the problem you are studying, there is practically no secondary data, then you will probably have to conduct an inductive study, that is, to collect a lot of factors, identify the interconnections and make a generalization.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
The second aspect is the amount of time to conduct the study. We have already discussed this with you.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:14.000
A deductive study takes a lot of time to analyze the literature and secondary sources of information, but a field study can be conducted in rather short periods.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And the opposite situation with the inductive study. When we talk about the inductive method of organization, we need to remember that the collection of information can take a lot of time, and the information obtained can lead you to the idea that you need to go another way or start all over again.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Therefore, you need to think very carefully. But I emphasize once again, for research in business, for a researcher, we most often accept the inductive method.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The only thing to note when we talk about the inductive and deductive methods is that they are mutually exclusive.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:24.000
That is, if you follow the deductive method, you cannot both build a theory and test it. But there is a very good but.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Since any research is divided into separate stages, it is very important that the separate stages can be built on different approaches.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:51.000
That is, at one stage you take the inductive approach, and at another stage you take the deductive approach. And then it will be a mutually exclusive method.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.000
And the last thesis. The leader for whom the research is conducted.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:07.000
The phrase has already been said that the leaders prefer the deductive method, because it is more familiar to them.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:29.000
If you consider it necessary to conduct an inductive research, you will certainly need to make a kind of justification for your approach and explain to the leader that this is the most rational way of organizing the research.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And the last thing we will focus on is the strategy and tactics of conducting the research.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And in order not to talk for a long time, first of all, we will note the difference in the terms of strategy and tactics.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Strategy is a general approach that the researcher takes as a program of his actions. There can be many such strategies.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:08.000
You have listed them. This is an experiment, a survey, a study of a practical situation, what is often called a case study.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:17.000
This can be a theory of a justified strategy, a justified theory, and so on.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Tactics is a set of methods of collecting information that the researcher uses to collect and analyze primary data.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:46.000
We will move on to the second topic of the review of the methods that are most often used in business research.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But first, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that at the end of the first topic you have a task for self-checking.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And in order to consolidate the information that may not yet have become knowledge, to work out these tasks and to look, maybe, to analyze the situation from your own practical life.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I am more than sure that you have already taken part in conducting research, maybe even without thinking about it.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Try to reflect on the research you have conducted and apply the theoretical positions that I have told you about to the practice that you already have.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Thank you. And we move on to the second topic.
