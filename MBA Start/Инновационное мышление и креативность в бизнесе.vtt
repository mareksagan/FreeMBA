00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hello, my name is Peter Pavel Srukov.

00:03.000 --> 00:09.000
The topic of our lesson today is innovative thinking and creativity, intuition in business.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Today we will look at the world, the world of mysteries, the world of miracles and magic,

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
the world of full possibilities, the possibilities that open up before us,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
and the magic that we will create with you in this world and for this world.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
Creativity and creative abilities.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
At the moment, we can say that we all live in the same world.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We all work on certain projects.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
We all work on some jobs.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Some of us are in a better position, some are in a worse position.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
Some of us strive upwards, and some of us remain at their level and do not develop throughout their lives.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Why does this happen? How does this happen?

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
Let's pay attention to the pyramid that is being built today in society,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
which is being built not only in society, but also in the market,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
to the pyramid that is being built in business.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
What can we see?

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
What is it? Or who is at the first step of this pyramid?

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
As a rule, these are low-skilled workers, or as a rule, these are low-skilled specialists.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
The majority of them.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
And we see that this mass is the foundation of the pyramid.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
But, as always, among this majority, there are special people,

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
those who do not want to be at the level of everyone.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
They strive a little higher.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Either to command others, or to receive higher salaries,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
or to drive the best cars, or to rest in the best hotels.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And we say that these people are more successful.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
We say that these people, some of them, can stand out.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
But not all of them.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
And finally, what can we see?

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
That the most successful people are at the very top of the pyramid.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
There are the least of them, but they have achieved success.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
And they use all the best benefits of civilization.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
All the best benefits that the world gives to these people.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Moreover, these benefits are not made on their own.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And they produce them.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
How do many businessmen, many successful people, ask the question,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
how did you achieve such success?

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Very often, in most cases, we hear the answer,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
thanks to our creative abilities,

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
thanks to the chance or the case that we took advantage of,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
thanks to our strong work ability,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
thanks to our goal-orientedness,

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
thanks to the construction of plans and the systematic movement to the goals.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
We will consider all these things today.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
But, note that, among other things, there was a moment,

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
a question, or an answer, that made us doubt.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
This question and this answer are creative abilities.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
As we know, creative abilities are not given to everyone.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
What to do?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Let's turn the page and see.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Are we capable of creativity?

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Are you capable of creating?

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
Think about this question now and try to complete the creative task.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
So, use only 10 figures.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
An ellipse, it can be ovals or circles,

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
a triangle and a rectangle.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Please, use only 10 figures.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
It can be only circles or three circles,

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
four triangles, two rectangles and one more oval.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Or it can be all rectangles.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The fact remains the fact.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
You have one limitation.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
One limitation is 10 figures.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
10 figures.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
From these 10 figures you have to make a figure of a living person.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Please, draw.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Before you start the task, I want to give you one piece of advice.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
This is a creative task.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Therefore, you have to complete it as only you and no one else can.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
You have to put all your creative abilities into it.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Please, stop the recording now.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Take a pen, a piece of paper,

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
a piece of paper in a free area,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
and draw a figure of a living person.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You have 5 minutes.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You are doing it for yourself.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Stop the recording and draw a figure of a living person.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
You have 5 minutes.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Start it again.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Before we look at the result,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
let's decide what creativity is.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Creativity is, first of all, productivity.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
You have to get a product.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
In our case, it is a drawing.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
It has to be elaborated, with details.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
And, of course, preferably not alone.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Think about it. A figure of a living person.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
What else is creativity?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Creativity is novelty.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
There is no point in repeating what has already been done by others.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You have to add something new.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
To define your own fresh look.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Creativity is purposefulness.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
It is not interesting to have something new.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
You have to add some creative idea,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
some constructive feature

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
necessary for further decisions.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You have to do something with it.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
You recall an anecdote.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
A teacher gathered a meeting and asked the children,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Children, we are having a celebration soon.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Let's decorate our classroom.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Please, suggest something.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
What can you suggest for our class?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
The children are reaching out.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
He says, yes, please, Masha, what do you want to say?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Masha says, let's bring flowers to the school

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
and decorate the windowsill with flowers.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
The teacher says, Masha, good job, let's do it.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
The teacher reaches out to Seryozha.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
She says, Seryozha, what do you want to suggest?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Seryozha says, let's bring photos to the school

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
and decorate our classroom with photos of our families,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
our children, our toys.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
She says, good job, Seryozha, well done, let's do it.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
She reaches out to Vasya.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
She says, Vasya, what do you want to say?

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Vasya stands up and says, let's put a red line on the ceiling.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
The teacher says, Vasya, what kind of expression is that?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
What kind of red line?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Let's go to the parents' school, quickly.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
On Saturday, on Friday, they come to the parents' school.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
The teacher says, can you imagine?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Masha says, let's bring flowers.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Seryozha says, let's bring photos to decorate the classroom.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
And Vasya says, let's put a red line.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
The teacher looks at her and says,

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
I don't like red, let's put a blue line.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
The point is that the new thing is not interesting,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
it is not needed by anyone, it will not be in demand.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
What's the point of painting the snow red?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
If you don't explain the purpose of your action,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
then they will think that there was white snow, and you ruined it.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
The next feature of creativity is originality.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
You and no one else can do that.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
If you ask 100 people to give them a sheet of paper

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
with a circle on it,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
and ask them to draw something on this circle,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
most people will draw a beak without thinking,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
and will say that it is a sun.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
Another part of people will draw eyes, mouth, nose,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
and will say that it is a little man.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
And only one or two people will draw a cat, a jaguar,

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
and will say that this circle is a spot on their wool.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
There is a test in psychology.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
On a sheet of paper, they draw a square,

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
and ask a person to draw a circle on it,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
without giving any more tasks.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
The vast majority of people draw this circle

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
either inside the square, or outside.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
And only one person will turn the sheet of paper over

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
and draw a circle on this side.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Creativity is always a way out of the task.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Availability.

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
The next feature of creativity is that your image should be understandable to others.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
It should not be just a thing.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It should be a concept.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It should not be just an artistic concept.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It should be a clear concept,

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
so that other people, looking at this image, understand what you want to say.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
And finally, the most important concept is vitality.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Your image should live and emit energy.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Let's compare the images you have,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
the figures you have drawn,

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
and the figures drawn by people with advanced creative abilities.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
In this case, this is a selection of drawings.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
These were the most creative and successful tasks.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Let's look at them.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
Each of these images satisfies the conditions of the task.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Each of these images has exactly 10 figures.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
Each of these figures is alive, original, and accessible to the eye.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
This figure is interesting,

11:39.000 --> 11:48.000
because it has turned into two figures, not one.

11:58.000 --> 12:07.000
Here, each figure has 10 figures, triangles and circles.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
And finally, here it is, the exit beyond the frame.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Here it is, the exit beyond the frame of the task.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Here it is, the introduction of your personal artist.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
As they say, who is talking about what.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
Let's talk about what prevents us from being creative.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
What prevents us from doing creativity,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
and does not allow us to do what others do.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Why is it given to some, not to others?

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
Why do they say that some are given by God, but others are not?

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Why do they say that this one sees and knows how to take advantage of the chance,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
and the chance passes by us?

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
Why do they say that one sees and can draw a black square

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
and give it to others for a brilliant work,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
and others draw a black square and say,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
well, what did you draw, my friend?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
What kind of artist are you?

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
So, the inertia of thinking that does not allow a person to create,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
to take advantage of, to offer the world something new,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
has its deep historical roots.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
First of all, let's remember how humanity developed.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
How from the Stone Age a person came to the present.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
After all, this, in fact, was not so long ago.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
And we can all imagine how a tribe of savages

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
sat in a cave by the fire,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
fried a leg of a mammoth,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
sang some songs,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
and then, behind the walls of the cave,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
in the street, a morning cry is heard.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
What do all the savages do?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
They are silent.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Mothers hide their children.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
And one, some innovator, curious, says,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
what is it that is so roaring?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
He says, let me go out and see.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
He goes out into the street and faces a sad bear.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
The tribe manages to get rid of him.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
And the mothers tell their children,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
look, do not stick out, be like everyone else,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
do not try to go beyond the limits.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
As they say, the innovator did not leave the offspring,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
those who are not interested in him survive.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
The next example.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
The same tribe walks through the forest,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
collects berries, mushrooms,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
in order to feed somehow this day.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Everyone collects pine needles,

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
pines, birch, apples, pears,

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
ribs, plums, raspberries,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
and only one goes and collects mushrooms

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
with red spots.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
He likes them, they are creative,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
they do not look like the rest.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
What happens?

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
Everything happens, the tribe lives normally,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
continues to live the measured life that lived,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
and this one, well, as God wills,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
either ate the mushrooms called fly-amores

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
and left the world,

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
or the spirits of the forest came to him,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
began to enlighten him about how to arrange the world,

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
how to pray to the gods, and so on.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
In other words, he becomes a shaman.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
We know that in the Old Testament it happened

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
that shamans, clergymen, cult servants,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
they have no families,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
and therefore do not leave offspring,

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
as people who left our world do not leave offspring.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
All this happens because of the attraction to the new,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
the attraction to the unknown.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Thus, throughout the life of a person,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
all his evolutionary stories

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
are formed in the head,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
the zone of anxiety and the zone of pleasure.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
They can be depicted as follows.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
If we take the skull,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
the brain,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
the brain of the head,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
then the zones of anxiety

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
will be represented by such a mesh.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
And only small areas

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
will be responsible for the pleasure.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
These experiments were carried out by our domestic psychophysiologists,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
American and German psychophysiologists,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
and they achieved exceptional results.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
It turned out that the information,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
before it gets to the center of pleasure,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
it passes through the mesh of these centers of anxiety.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
And the first thing a person says when he encounters a new one is,

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
is it dangerous?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
What is the danger to me?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
What can happen

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
if I use something new?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
You can give me a lot of examples

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
of how you were offered something new,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
and you said,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
this is new, this is not verified,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
it is not known whether it will work.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
And only in the last decade we have been observing the race for new.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
But where is this race for new?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
It is on the edge, at the peak of innovation.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
At the moment we are waiting for a new mobile phone,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
we are waiting for a new, more fast-acting computer,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
when a new TV will finally appear

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
with a clearer image,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
when we will get new DVDs with a new quality,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
and so on and so forth.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
But, pay attention,

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
if I offer you a car with a hydrogen engine,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
will you buy it in a queue?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
You will not immediately say,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
but where will I refuel?

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Hydrogen explodes much more than gasoline,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
will this car drive?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
All your arguments are justified,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
and all your arguments are caused by the centers of anxiety.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
And this is right,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
because if you were constantly

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
enjoying,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
it would not lead us to the evolutionary peak

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
that we are at today.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
The same scientists,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
the same psychophysiologists,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
conducted the following experiments.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
They took a rat,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
poor rats,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
opened the skull box,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
and put an electrode

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
right in one of the centers of pleasure.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
And they taught the rat to use this electrode.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
That is, they showed the rat a button

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
that it can press

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
and at that moment get bliss,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
the pleasure that this part of the brain is responsible for.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
What do you think happened?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
How fast did the rat learn

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
to use this button?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
How do you think?

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
How long did the rat live?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Yes, the rat died of dehydration.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Despite the fact that there was water in its cell,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
there was food,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
the rat pressed the button and did not leave it.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
The rat lived until the end of its life.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
The next stage is psychological.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
This is also a very important criterion

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
and a very important factor

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
of emergence of the human thinking.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Again, scientists,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
psychologists,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
and physiologists

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
have processed data

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
from many experiments.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
If we look at the human brain,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
we will find that it consists of two parts.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Two halves of the large hemispheres of the brain

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
are the right and left hemispheres.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
In fact, the right and left hemispheres

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
determine each of them

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
for the area of responsibility

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
associated with the field of human activity.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
The right hemisphere of the human brain

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
is responsible for creative abilities,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
for creative inclinations,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
for the perception of beauty,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
for the perception of music,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
for the perception of pictures, nature,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
singing of birds,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
and the left hemisphere is responsible for logic.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
The left hemisphere is the area of numbers,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
of evidence,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
of logical reasoning,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
and of everything rational.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
So, there are two parts,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
emotional and rational.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
If we return to the inner dialogue,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
we will ask ourselves when we are thinking

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
that each of us has an inner dialogue.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
We can say that it is the two halves of our brain

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
that are talking.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
One has a creative and the other has a rational beginning.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Now let's go back to our childhood

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
and remember when we wanted to do something new.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
When we wanted to play a prank,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
measure the depth of this puddle,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
climb this tree,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
look where the sun sets,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
what our parents told us,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
don't dream,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
do your business,

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
don't even think about it.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
As a result,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
the main goal of our childhood

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
was to do something new.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
We were not able to do it,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
but we were able to realize that

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
the main dominant half-ball

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
is the one that is responsible

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
for the rational behavior.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
It is like it is increasing its volume

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
and telling its creative half-ball

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
to wait,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
not to hurry,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
to listen to it.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Now we have important things

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
that don't require delay.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Now we have things that pay us money

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
or give us awards

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
and we get paid for them.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Therefore, all your ideas

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
and all your proposals

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
are good,

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
they are good for recreation,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
but now it is time to work.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Wait, don't dream, don't think.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
It turns out that

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
during one's life

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
a person develops rational,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
kills creative.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Therefore, new creative abilities

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
are not important.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
A person is creative or not.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
In reality, we are all creative.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
We all have the same abilities.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Someone suppresses them,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
and someone allows them

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
to be on par with the rational.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And someone, on the contrary,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
has creative abilities over rational.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Then this person leaves society

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
because he looks different from others.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Many artists and musicians

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
were met on the streets

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
who have extravagant clothes

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
or extravagant appearance.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Their creativity is so superior

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
that they try to show it

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
in the audience,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
in communication with many people

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
and even with themselves.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
They try to stand out in everything.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Sometimes these standouts

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
become curious.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
But we did not think about one more thing

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
related to the history of humanity.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
First of all, this question

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
concerns our brain.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Our scientists and psychologists

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
conducted the following experiment.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
They took an ordinary adult

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
and balanced him on the scales.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
And asked him to move his toes.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
And what did the experiment do?

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
The scales went down immediately.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
After that,

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
the human brain

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
was asked to solve the problem.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
The brain moved

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
and the scales went down.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
What would it mean?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
It turned out that

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
whether it happens in the physical body

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
at the level of muscle reduction

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
or in the nervous work,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
it consumes all energy.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Energy in the human body is blood.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Blood brings energy

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
to the organ that works more.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Blood brings energy

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
to the organ that consumes energy.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
And during its evolution,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
the brain,

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
as well as any other organ,

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
learned to save energy.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
If the brain consumes a lot of energy,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
it means that energy is not enough for the muscles.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
It means that the person will not have time

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
to escape from the tiger's cage.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
The brain learned to save energy.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
The brain learned to save energy.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Once the problem is solved,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
the brain does not want to solve it anymore.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
It acts according to the standard.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
After solving the problem once,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
the brain always solves the problem

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
in the way it has already solved.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Therefore, any new decision,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
the brain is a source of increased danger.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
The brain has to solve this problem.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
The brain has to spend unnecessary energy.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Therefore, the first reaction to new energy is

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
to say, no, I don't need it.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Wait, don't rush.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
In this case, on the one hand,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
the brain protects us.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Imagine that every time you wake up in the morning,

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
you need to remember or invent a new way

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
to tie your laces.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Every time you wake up in the morning,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
you need to remember how to use a toothbrush.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
At the moment, we do it all automatically.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
We don't even think about how we brush our teeth,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
how we clean the bed,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
how we get ready to go to work.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
But once we did it all for the first time.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
We were taught all this.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
At the moment, it's all gone automatically.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
When we are told to choose another route

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
when going to work,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
we say, no, thank you, we are comfortable this way.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I'm already used to this way,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
I will go this way.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
The only thing that can move us

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
is today's car traffic jams.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
We need to try to find a way around.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
But we don't do it often.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
We often sit down and do what we did.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
This kind of people are called conservative.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
When we say,

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
once our brain solved the problem,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
well done, no more.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Let's consider the third reason

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
for the manifestation of inertia in a person's thinking.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Not every person is a creative person.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
So, this is a theological reason.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Let's take the most common and popular book in the world.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
I have the Bible in my hands.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
Let's open it.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Let's open it on the first page.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
The first book of Moses.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Chapter 1, verse 1.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
I quote from verse 1.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
It says,

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
God created heaven and earth in the beginning.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Let's pause for a second and think.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
What did God do in the beginning?

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
He created.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Who is God?

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
God is the Creator.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
So, God's belonging,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
or divine entity,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
is to create.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
God is the Creator.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
The rest of the verses say

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
that He created the light,

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
the earthly creatures, the sea creatures, and so on.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
But verse 26 is the creation of man.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
What does it say?

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
God said,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Let us create man according to our image, according to our likeness.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And let them reign over the sea fish,

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
and over the birds of heaven,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
and over the cattle, and over all the earth,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
and over all the beasts that hang on the earth.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Verse 27.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
And God created man according to the image of man,

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
and man created them according to the image of God.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
So, the Bible gave us the answer.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
If we read carefully what is written,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
we find the difference

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
in the divine creation

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
between what God intended to do

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
and what He did.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Let us read the beginning of verse 26 more carefully.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
And God said,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Let us create man according to our image,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
according to our likeness.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
And let us read verse 27.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
And God created man according to the image of man,

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
according to the image of God.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
And He created him, man and woman.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
What is missing?

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Man lacked likeness.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
He was created according to the image of God,

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
but without likeness.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
He intended to create according to the image and likeness,

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
but he got only the image.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Perhaps this is why there is a widespread opinion

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
that creative inclinations are a gift from God.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Not everyone is given this gift.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
God intended to give likeness,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
but not everyone succeeded.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
Likeness means to be a creator,

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
to determine the inner content,

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
to create according to the image of God,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
to create something new,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
something that has not yet been created,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
to create abilities and opportunities,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
whether they are given or not.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
But we have good news.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Since God intended to create man

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
according to the image of man,

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
we decided to use this intention.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
And for this we are doing our today's task.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
The topic we are discussing now is the management of one's abilities.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
We will see why someone becomes a winner,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
and someone does not.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
How goals are built,

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
and what role do images play in the construction of goals,

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
and how to achieve the right psychological attitude

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
to come to victory, to be at the top of the pyramid.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Let's look at who becomes a winner,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
or what makes a person a winner.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
As Jack Walsh, the CEO of General Electric,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
used to say,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
if you do not take the opportunity to win,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
then others will do it for you.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
What is hidden behind these words?

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
What did this man want to tell us?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
The meaning should be clear to everyone.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
The whole world is filled with opportunities.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Everyone has the same opportunities,

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
but someone uses these opportunities, someone does not.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Remember, we all had the same starting positions

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
when we said,

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
please draw a human figure using only 10 figures,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
a square, a triangle and a helix.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Everyone had the same resources at their disposal,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
but someone managed to compile them,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
and he got something outstanding.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
And someone refused to do this work at all,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
and decided to do it later.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
What is difficult here?

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
The difficulty is that someone takes and does,

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
and someone says, I will have time.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
This is what distinguishes a winner from a loser.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
The winner does not stop at what he has achieved,

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
he does not pass by the opportunities he has received,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
he does not pass by the opportunities provided by the environment.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
He takes these opportunities and uses them.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
But how?

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Is he satisfied with every opportunity,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
every opportunity, every idea offered to him?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Or does he prefer the ideas that are spread all over the world?

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
We know that many people come to us,

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
and we meet them, and each of them tells us,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
here is an interesting idea, here is a pleasant case,

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
here is such an opportunity, here is such an opportunity.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
If you follow everyone, you have to run away,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
and you spend your energy on the right and on the left,

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
and as a result you come to nothing.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
The Russian folk proverb says,

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
that you chase two hares and you do not catch one.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
How to be? How to find out which hare is yours?

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
And which one to chase?

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Here we get the experience of great people,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
the experience of people who have passed many trials in life

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
and have achieved great goals.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Let's look at the example of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
Already today, when he became the governor of the United States,

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger says that he always knew,

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
being a boy,

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
that he would achieve a lot in life.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
He clearly imagined what heights in society would be mastered by him,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
what heights he would reach.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
And he gives such an example.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
Even before he won his first prize, the Mr. Universe,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
he clearly imagined,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
training and competing in intermediate competitions,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
how he would be awarded this prize, the Mr. Universe.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
He knew and, approaching these competitions,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
he had no doubt that the prize would be his.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
Before all these years of competition,

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
he imagined how he would receive this prize,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
how this prize would be awarded to him.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
So, when this prize was really awarded to him,

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
he no longer doubted and was not surprised that he got this prize.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
The same thing, he says, happened to his acting career.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
When he first started filming,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
he imagined how he would be a popular actor,

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
a well-paid actor,

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
who would be in various films.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
And we know why we love Schwarzenegger.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Why we see Arnold in the movies,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
as a monster killer, as a comedy actor.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
And we love him for his versatility,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
for his ability to show himself and play any role,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
even if someone says that he is a mountain of muscles.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
But we have seen him in many comedy films.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
And finally,

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
when he, a native of the United States,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
runs for governor,

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
he clearly imagines and dreams

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
how he would become and take up the post of governor.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
His imagination, his dreams,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
his built image clearly make him understand,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
or simply draw him into the world

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
he built with his imagination.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
How can this happen?

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
How can this happen?

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
Why do some people build these images

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
and get into them, and others don't?

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
The answer to this question is both difficult and simple.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Some people find strength in themselves,

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
find confidence in themselves,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
and find the opportunity to dream

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
about the future.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
And others refuse to dream.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
They refuse to dream.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
And they say to themselves,

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
this is still a dream,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
dreams will not come true,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
why should I dream again?

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
But let's go back to our past.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Let each of us remember,

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
did you have a case when you dreamed about something?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Did you dream hard?

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
And you got what you dreamed about.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
Dig into your memory.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
I am sure that this is what everyone has.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Someone dreamed about a new job,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
an interesting one, and got it.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
Someone dreamed about buying a car, and got it.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Someone dreamed about a new apartment,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
and now lives in this apartment.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
Someone dreamed about getting married,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
imagining a future spouse, and got it.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Someone dreamed about starting their own business,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
and now owns this business.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
Why do we still treat our dreams so seriously?

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Why is it still considered indecent

43:24.000 --> 43:30.000
to dream and talk about your dreams in society and among people?

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
What is the reason?

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
It is not in vain that we talked about inertia of thinking

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
at the end of the last topic.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
It is connected with the fact that we were told

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
that it is harmful to dream.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
Do not dream, do not think, be like everyone else,

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
do what you are asked to do.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
But today we are entering a new era.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
Today we live in the 21st century.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
This century demands creativity, creative abilities,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
constant innovation, constant change.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Today our inner self tells us

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
to be a creator, to dream, to do something new,

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
to create a future for yourself, for your country, for all of humanity.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Let's move on to the next topic.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
What is the goal of education?

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
How are goals created?

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
How are they achieved?

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
Let's talk about this topic.

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
In 1953, an experiment was conducted at the University of Yeltsin.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Graduates of this university,

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
preparing to receive diplomas,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
were asked one question.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Dear graduates, please tell me,

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
which of you has a clear goal, what does he want to achieve in life?

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
The answer to this question is interesting.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
Only 3% of students said that they have a clear goal.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
They clearly know how to achieve it.

45:28.000 --> 45:36.000
13% of students said that they have an idea of what they want in life.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
They have an idea of their goals.

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
84% said that they haven't thought about their goals yet.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
They have an idea of what they want in life.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
The main goal for today is to receive a diploma,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
to have a rest, to swim, to sunbathe, to go to a disco.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
Only after they find a new job,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
they will think about their goals.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Pay attention to these numbers.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
3% had a clear goal and knew how to achieve it.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
13% just wanted and knew what they wanted from life.

46:24.000 --> 46:35.000
84% had no idea what awaits them in the future and what they are striving for.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
Exactly 20 years later, in 1973,

46:42.000 --> 46:48.000
the same experimenters found the same people.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
But since money is the key to success in the United States,

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
they began to measure the well-being of these former students.

47:01.000 --> 47:08.000
What do you think they found?

47:12.000 --> 47:21.000
How much did these 3% succeed in relation to others?

47:22.000 --> 47:35.000
It turned out that the total income of these 3%

47:36.000 --> 47:44.000
exceeded the total income of all other graduates.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
When they began to find out what the matter was,

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
how they managed it, it turned out that everything was the same.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
These 3% had a clear idea of their goals.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Most of them said that they had already achieved these goals.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
Now they have higher goals.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
And that they were moving towards their goals,

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
following a certain plan, developed back then,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
which was only occasionally corrected.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
The remaining students, now adults,

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
about 13% said that they had dreams,

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
that they remembered what they dreamed of in the future,

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
to study at a college, to study at a university.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
But the dreams were not fruitful.

48:46.000 --> 48:53.000
And about 84% did not think about their goals,

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
and lived their lives following their goals.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
They threw themselves to the right or to the left,

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
trying to catch the chance.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
So, we asked ourselves a question.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
How to understand if this is my chance or not?

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
Should I catch my chance in this place or not?

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
Should I take this offer or not?

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
Does it make sense to work with these people,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
or should I take others?

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
The answer to these questions

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
was given by these 3% of people,

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
who had clearly set goals,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
and who had plans to achieve them.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
Moreover, these opportunities opened up to them

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
when they moved from one stage to another.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
And they needed a new resource, new knowledge, new situations.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Then, as if by magic,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
as if by the invention of a magic wand,

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
those opportunities opened up to them,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
and they started to dream about them.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Again, everything goes back to dreams.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
So, the main parameters of success,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
determining a successful person from a unsuccessful one,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
determining a winner from a winner,

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
are a clear vision of goals,

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
a clear idea of goals,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
what I want from life,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and a knowledge of a plan,

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
how I will achieve these goals.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Let's recall,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
God created man in His image.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
We create our life in His image.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
The image plays a primary role.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
In the beginning, we need to create an image,

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
and only then this image is filled with the material world,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
or is filled with material things.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
In the beginning, the mental image is created in our head,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
it is created in our thoughts,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
and it is directed to the future.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
It is an image of the desired future,

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
an image of a possible future,

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
an image of our possibilities.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
But this image will not be realized if we do not have a plan,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
if we just sit and dream,

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
as these 13% showed,

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
we will not succeed.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
We need to undertake something else,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
to achieve our goals, to achieve our success.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
An interesting point.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
In the 1970s, in the United States,

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
there was a serious interest in long-term research.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
Long-term research is a research that is extended in time,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
like the research at Yale University,

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
which began in 1953 and ended in 1973.

52:27.000 --> 52:33.000
One of such experiments is described in American literature.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
The experiment is as follows.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
In the early 1970s,

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
thousands of students were carefully selected.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
Among them, the brightest representatives were selected,

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
the best representatives of the American class.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
These were not white people,

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
these were not black people,

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
these were not Chinese people,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
these were mixed people.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
There were all of them.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
There were many, many schoolchildren who passed through this experiment.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
Among them, the best representatives of the schools,

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
the best representatives of the classes were selected,

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
and they were going to the same school.

53:24.000 --> 53:30.000
The same careful selection was carried out among all the teachers of the United States.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
Among 100,000, hundreds of thousands of students,

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
a few were selected.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Among tens of thousands of teachers,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
a few were also selected and sent to these experimental schools.

53:44.000 --> 53:50.000
The most outstanding programs of education were created for these experimental schools.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
The students were told that they were the most outstanding students,

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
the brightest representatives of the American continent.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
The same was said to the teachers.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
The teachers were given special instructions on the upbringing of special children,

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
and the teachers themselves belonged to a special cohort of teachers,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
on whom the greatest hopes were placed.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
After they graduated from school,

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
the same way, the cut of these students was made.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
It turned out that the vast majority of these students

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
took outstanding positions in society.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
They became senators,

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
they became presidents of companies,

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
owners of their own business,

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
outstanding journalists,

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
outstanding inventors and engineers.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
The essence of this experiment,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
its tragedy,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
or its whole charm,

54:55.000 --> 55:02.000
is that the best representatives of their kind

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
were the most average students.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Among hundreds of thousands, the most average students were selected,

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
the most average,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
without any distinction from the others.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Neither excellent students, nor hooligans, nor debauchers,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
nor creatives,

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
nor talents.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
But the most, the most average.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
The same was done with the teachers.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
The most average teachers were selected,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
without any distinction, without any printing,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
without any flaws, without any injuries, nothing.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
If not for this experiment,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
no one would have known about these teachers and these students.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
The same way, the curriculum was selected.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
These were the most average curriculum of the middle school.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Just one thing.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
One attitude.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
That you are a unique personality.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
That you have great hopes.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
And that you have great success.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
That you have great success.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
One, just one, psychological attitude.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
The basic principles of self-impression.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
There are only three of them.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
You can not only do it,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
not necessarily enter a state of relaxation,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
in order to self-impress yourself.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
There are at least three more ways of self-impression,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
that you can do on your way to work,

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
during breaks, during lunch breaks, during work.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
The first way of self-impression is affirmation.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
You affirm as if something should happen.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
For example, you need to pass an exam.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Or, for example, you need to pass an interview.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Or you need to sign some important contract.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Starting in a day, in two,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
before you need to sign the contract,

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
you constantly repeat,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I will take this client, I will sign this contract.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
This contract will be signed.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
This contract will be signed.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
I will sign this contract.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
This client will be mine.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
I will take this client.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Thus, as they say, water grinds the stone.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Little by little,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
until your creative consciousness,

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
until your creative consciousness,

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
until your creative hemisphere

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
begins to be a little bit more confident

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
in the implementation of your plans.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
in the implementation of your plans.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
As a result,

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
as practice shows,

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
in most cases,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
such a psychological attitude leads you to victory,

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
leads you to success.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
And when the time comes to sign the contract,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
you will no longer doubt signing this contract.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
And finally,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
you should not just imagine

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
how this contract will be concluded,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
you should not just imagine how this contract will be concluded,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
you should not just foresee the whole situation

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
and imagine it in reality.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You need to be convinced that this contract will happen.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
And what does conviction give us?

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
A lived experience.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
What can we say about our past?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
We are convinced of its implementation.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
We are convinced of its implementation.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
In the same way,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
we should be convinced of the implementation of future things.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
We should look at them as if they have already happened.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
When the disciples came to Jesus Christ and said,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
Teacher, teach us how to pray.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Jesus Christ answered,

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
Pray as if you have already received what you are asking for.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
This is the main principle of self-improvement.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
In this case, the principle of self-improvement is similar to the prayer

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
that Jesus Christ said to his disciples.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Repeat to yourself,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
want and desire what you are asking for,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
as if you have already received it.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
And then it will come true.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And then it will be given to you.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
But we talked about a long-term experiment

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and talked about schoolchildren,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
who were told from childhood that they were meant for something more.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
That they are outstanding personalities.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
That great hopes are placed on them.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
How can we, who have not been conducted this experiment,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
who still doubt,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
whether they can do something great or not?

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
What do you think?

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
If you had already won the race of millions,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
if you had already participated in any competition

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
in which millions competed with you,

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
imagine,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
you won the Olympics,

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
or you competed with millions of companies

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
on a very competitive market,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
and your company was ahead,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
you became the winner.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Or you participated in the selection

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
for a vacant position,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
which was sought by a million people,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
and you were chosen as the best.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Tell me, please,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
how can you,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
purely by your inner state,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
your psychological mood,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
believe that it will be so?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Most likely,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
that having won once in the race of millions,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
having won once in a competition,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
for a new competition,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
for a new goal,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
for a new competitiveness,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I ask you to pay attention to the words,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I will make you a small gift.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It may seem small to someone,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
but someone will take it with him for life,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
he will change his whole idea of life.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Everyone knows about it,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
but few people think about the meaning of it.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
many,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
or even most,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
know that during ejaculation,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
sperm of a man

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
is splashed from 5 to 100 million sperm.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You also know

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
that from these millions of sperm

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
only one fertilizes the egg cell.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Each of us

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
has gone through the evolutionary path of development

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
from sperm to adult.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Each of us

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
has won in the race of millions.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Think about it.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Each of us

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
is a representative of a multi-million community.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
All the other millions,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
they died to win the race.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
You are a representative of a whole people,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
a whole civilization.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And you represent its interests.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Once you have won in the multi-million race,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
to compete with some hundred other

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
like you is not possible anymore.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It is not possible to imagine

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
how many people

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
will be there

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
to win the race.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Realize your victory.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And go through life

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
with this realization.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
We are moving to

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
another sub-topic

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
called

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
intuition.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It is a very important

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
sub-topic.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Each of us

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
has faced

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
such a situation in life.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
When somewhere

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
something was telling us

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
to go here

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
or not to go there.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But we did our own thing.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
We turned to our rational mind

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and said that nothing can happen.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Because it has rational

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and logical explanations.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
We did what our mind told us

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
but not as intuition.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And every time when something went wrong

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
we said that we felt it.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I knew something.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I will tell you a story

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
that happened to me.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I was a student.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I will tell you about my mistake.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Once I had to buy a car.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I came to the seller

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and examined the car.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I was satisfied with everything.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
But something inside me

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
was telling me

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
not to buy this car.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I remembered

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
that I was buying a car

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and regretting it.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Then I listened to my doubts

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and hired an expert.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
He was a car mechanic

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
who was an expert

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
in cars

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
and had a lot of experience.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
He went to the car

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
and examined the car thoroughly.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
He drove it on a lift.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
We drove a few more kilometers.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Everything was fine.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I trusted the expert

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and the seller.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I trusted that the car

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
would be a good choice for me.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And that it would be what I was dreaming about.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The expert told me

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
that I had to buy it

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
for the price.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
The next day we drove

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
and re-registered the car.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
That day we had to drive it

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
for about 100 kilometers.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
We live in a country house in the summer.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
It's about 100 kilometers

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
from one end of Moscow to the country house.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I got in the car

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
and drove.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
About 30-50 kilometers later

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I noticed strange things.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It turned out

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
that the car had a malfunction

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
of the automatic transmission.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But this malfunction

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
can only be noticed

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
when the car is well warmed up

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
and has driven for a long time.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's clear that my attempts

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
to find the seller

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
were unsuccessful.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
His mobile phone was turned off.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
All other contacts were interrupted.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
The address he had

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
in the PTS

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
was not known.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
So it was a hit.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
After I had already registered

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
the car,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I had to look for the seller.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
But I live in a country house

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
and I can't turn off my mobile phone.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
So I had to sell it to the honest seller.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
To be honest,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I couldn't fix the malfunction.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So I lost

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
about 50% of the money I paid for it.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
But

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I gained much more.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Later

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I began to pay attention

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
to the inner voice

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
that worries me

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
when I make a deal.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I began to pay attention

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
to the cases

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
when the inner voice

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
tells me that it makes sense

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and it doesn't.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Moreover,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I began to pay attention

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
to the cases of déjà vu

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
that sometimes tell us

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
that I have seen it before

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and I remember it.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I began to scroll my memory

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
to see what it means

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
when entrepreneurs

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
work with such intuition.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Most successful entrepreneurs

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
rely on their intuition.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I remember the statement

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
of a businessman

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
who knew nothing

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
about proteins,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
biological additives,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
biogranulates.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
He asked his childhood friend

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
to start a business

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and told him about

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the fermentative meat

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
that is used in the food industry.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
He said that this peptone

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
in our country

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
has stopped being produced

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
but he knows where to buy it

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
in order to start selling it.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
He listened to his childhood friend

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and invested in this business.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Today he is one of the biggest players

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
in the biochemistry market in Moscow.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
He is one of the biggest suppliers

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
of different biological additives

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
in food in the food market in Moscow.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
How?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
How did he start

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
his business

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
without knowing anything

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
about chemistry,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
biological additives,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
biotechnology?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
He is a man with a mathematical education,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
he risks,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
he sells his car,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
he invests money in this field.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I have repeatedly asked him

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
this question,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
why is there a gold mine?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
What did you tell me

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
that I should do?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
What does it tell me?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
What is inside of us?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
What inner voice tells us

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
whether to do it or not?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Why do some people listen to this inner voice

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
and others don't?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Most of the successful people

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
give a lot of importance

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
to their inner voice.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
They say that

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
they would never understand

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
this intricate information

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
if they didn't listen to their inner voice.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Sometimes you have to make a decision

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
instantly,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
without having time to study all aspects of this business.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And then the only right decision

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
is to listen to the inner voice.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Let's recall.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Most of the great people

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
get answers to their questions in their dreams.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Mendeleev.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
For a long time

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
many alchemists of the world

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
were fighting to sort out

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
the scattered system of chemical elements

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
that existed.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Mendeleev was asking himself the same question.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And one night

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
he saw this table in his dream.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It was the beginning of a new science.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Since then we have not alchemy,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
but chemistry.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Elias Hume,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
the inventor of the sewing machine.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
For a long time he was fighting

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
how to make a knot in a needle

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
go back and forth

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
until he had a dream

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
that he was on an uninhabited island

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
surrounded by natives

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
stabbing him with spears.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Each spear has a hole

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
on the edge of the spear.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
The hole is located here.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
When he woke up,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
he realized

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
that just by moving the needle's ear

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
from the end to the beginning

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
you can make knots.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Another famous inventor,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
biologist James Watson,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
who discovered the DNA formula,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
had the same dream.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
He was sleeping

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
and he had a dream

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
that two snakes were fighting

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
and hanging from a tree.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
When he woke up,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
he realized that the DNA formula

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
is a double spiral.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And he got a Nobel Prize for this.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Thus, in our unconscious

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
there are really

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
hidden possibilities

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
that can be used for our purposes

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and for our benefit.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I am going back to the topic

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
when we said

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
that the first thing to do

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
is to build an image of the desired future.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The second thing to do

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
is to write a clear plan of achieving this goal

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
or this image of the desired future.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
This plan will work for us.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
It will help us to find the things

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and ideas that we need to achieve success.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It will give us the opportunities

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
that we dream about

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
and that we can use.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
as always,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
the question is what to do

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
and how to do it.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
There is no time to wait for months

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
or weeks to make a decision.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
There is no time to relax

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
and to have a nervous muscle relaxation session

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
in order to get the right answer

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
while being relaxed.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
The answer will be the same

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
as we talked about self-improvement.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Let's make a statement.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The question is

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
how to make a rational decision

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and to make it in accordance with your intuition.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
How to make a rational grain of grain

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
and to open up to creativity.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Then we start to act in the same way.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
We just start to speak

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
and to inspire ourselves

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
that we trust our intuition

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
and that it will give us the right answer.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I trust my intuition

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
and my intuition will give me the right answer.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
After repeating this statement ten times,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
at the end of the tenth statement

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
we will listen to it

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
and the first inner voice that will tell you

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
will be the right answer

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
to make the right decision.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Now we will try

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
the tools that

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
many people use in their daily life.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
When there is no time to wait

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
for the third eye to open,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
when there is no time to wait for the talent to show up,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
when you need to create something new,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
something creative right now.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
People often ask

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
how to make a rational decision.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
It is easy to make a decision spontaneously,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
but can you make it on purpose?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Imagine that when you are completely relaxed

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
you don't need to inspire yourself

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
with creative development.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Instead you imagine that you are surrounded

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
by people who are important for you,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
who understand your field.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
You can imagine that you are visited

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
by Bill Clinton, Bill Gates,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Vladimir Putin,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Alla Pugacheva and Joseph Kabzon

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
who are consulting you on your question.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
You are asking them questions in your mind

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
and they are answering you.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
They are working together to find the right answer

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
that interests you.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Napoleon Hill,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
the author of the book The Duma and the Rich,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
tried such a mental representation.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Hillary Clinton uses such a mental consultation.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Many successful entrepreneurs advise such a mental consultation.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
When they can't find the right answer on their own,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
they present themselves in the society

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
as people whose opinion is important for them

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
and ask them questions

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and consult with them on a mental level.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Nobody knows and can't explain

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
what is happening in nature

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
and why it is happening.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But the answers are there.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And the practice shows

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
that these answers confirm the reality.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
These answers are the answers people are looking for.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
These answers lead people to success.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
The next topic of our lesson is the development of creative imagination.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
These are methods of not disarming the intuition,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
not disarming the subconscious.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
These are methods we can use

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
while being in our usual state of consciousness.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
These are methods that allow us

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
to apply the skills of creativity

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
without entering into some special altered states of consciousness

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and without expecting to be disoriented.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Let's get acquainted with these methods.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
There are many of them,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
but the most basic and effective

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
are the methods we are going to learn today.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
The first method I want to show you

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
is the method used to develop the ability to remember.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It is called Atlantis.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
It is a method of memory.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
It is a method of memory

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
that allows us to remember

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
the words we are going to say.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Put your hands on the paper.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Close your eyes.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Try to remember the words I am going to say.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You need to imagine them clearly.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Keep them in your mind.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And at the end of the exercise

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
write them down on a piece of paper.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Are you ready?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Let's start.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
The house.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
The ship.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
The moon.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
The sailor.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
The dog.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
The stool.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
The tower.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
The train.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
The glass.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
The ship.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
The shelf.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
The air.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
The pit.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The sea.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
The girl.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
The parachute.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
The tobacco.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
The rainbow.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
The motorcycle.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
The bucket.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
The smile.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
The first word is the house.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
The last word is the smile.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Please try to repeat these words

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
in the same order they were pronounced.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Stop the recording.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Write down the words and count them.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
How many did you get?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The psychologists calculated

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
that the normal size

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
or the normal volume of the normal human's RAM

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
is equal to 5-8 objects.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
That is, in a normal case

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
the number of objects is equal to 5.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
In a non-excessive case

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
a person remembers from 5 to 8

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
objects that are not connected to each other.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
These are the objects that we have just pronounced in the form of words.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
But why do we refer to this method

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
as the method of creative imagination,

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
the development of creative imagination?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
This method has one interesting feature.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
One interesting point.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
You can remember a large amount of information

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
using one elementary method.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
You can start imagining

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
how the first object is transformed into another

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
or how it is connected to it.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
You can write a kind of script

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
from the words that are pronounced separately.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Let's imagine how this can look like.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
The first word is the house.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
The second word is the ship.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I associate the house with the ship.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
The house is transformed into a ship

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and becomes a captain's cabin.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
The next word is the moon.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I imagine a ship flying against the background of the moon.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
It is flying,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
the sails are inflated

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
and at this moment a sailor falls from the ship.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
The next word was a sailor.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
The sailor falls to the shore

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
and a dog runs up to him and starts biting him by the leg.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Or a little bit higher.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Accordingly,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
a stool falls on the dog.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
The stool turns into a tower.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The tower is not a tower by itself.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
The tower is a pipe at the train

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
that is flying at full speed somewhere far away.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Looking from afar,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
we see that the train is flying along the edge of the stool.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Then the stool turns into a shelf.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Some kind of bookshelf

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
that hangs in the air.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
It is not just air,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
but a pipe that blows to the ground

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
and a pit is formed on the ground.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
But nothing is empty,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
so the pit is filled with water and a sea is formed.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
A sea in which a girl is swimming.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
This girl is pulled out of the sea by a parachute.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
As a result, everything crumbles

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and falls to the ground with tobacco.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
But not everything falls to the ground.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
The books turn into a rainbow.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
A motorcycle is racing along this rainbow at full speed,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
behind which a bucket is tied.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Of course, all this makes you smile.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Thus,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
having connected the sequence of 20 words,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000
it is not difficult for me to name them one after another.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Try again.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Put the piece of paper aside

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
or turn it over to the other side.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Take a pen and try to reproduce

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
the words that we have voiced.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So, the first word is a house.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
The last word is a smile.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
The clock is ticking.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
There is another method

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
that allows you to fill in such a large number

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
of objects that are not connected at all.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I like it less,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
but it is also present.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
It can also be used.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
If you often have to remember a large amount of information,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
you can use it as a clue

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
or as a clue,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
to find objects in your house.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Imagine your room.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
You probably know where your wardrobe is,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
where your phone is, where your TV is,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
where your bedside table is,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
where your table lamp is,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
where your daylight lamp is,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
which side of the window is on which side,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
which curtains are on which curtains,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
what is usually on the windowsill,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
what is on the wall.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
In this way,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
remembering your things,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
remembering your situation,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
you can create a mental map.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And to this map,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
to the location of your things,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
you can attach other words

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
or other things that you need.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
For example, I decided to remember the word house.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I remember that in my room there is a wardrobe.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And I imagine how my wardrobe turns into my house.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
The one I want to remember.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
The next thing I have is a bedside table.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I connect the bedside table to the ship.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
The next is a TV.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I connect it to the Moon.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
In this way,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
consistently combining different objects,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I build up the sequence of words

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
that I am going to remember.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
You can do the same operation.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
You may ask,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
how are these methods of memory

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
connected with the development of creative imagination?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I do not offer in vain

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
to create a mental map.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I do not offer in vain

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
to create a mental map.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I do not offer in vain

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
to start with this.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Because to connect a rainbow

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
and curtains

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
may seem difficult to someone.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Someone may say,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
it is not a big deal,

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
curtains are bent,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and a rainbow is formed.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Someone may say,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
it is not a big deal,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
but it is not a big deal.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
The development of creative imagination

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
is to imagine how incompatible

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
are the things that combine with each other.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
How a rainbow is formed from a tobacco,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
how a wardrobe becomes a house,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
how a TV becomes a Moon,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
how a phone becomes a sea.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
By connecting such things,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
we remove stereotypes,

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
we break the inertia of thinking,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
we open up to the new,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and as a result, this new opens up to us.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Let us consider another method,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
which is impossible to apply

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
without the developed

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
creative imagination

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
and without the method of connecting

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
the two things we have already obtained.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
In the theory of solving

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
the creative imagination,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
there are laws of the development

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
of artificial systems.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
One of the laws states

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
that any system develops in a spiral,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
from a monosystem to a b-system.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
A monosystem develops

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
in a b-system.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
A b-system develops

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
in a polysystem.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
This is a common law of development.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
We can see it in the example

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
of a plant,

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
a new seed, etc.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
In this case,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
we consider only one common law

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
of development from a monosystem to a b-system.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And our topic is the topic of b-systems.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
It would seem that

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
A and B

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
are the same thing.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Nothing unusual.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
But if we add a little imagination,

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
a little imagination,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
we will see

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
that we have a little man.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Let us see how it develops.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
To make it more fun,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
we will call our b-systems

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
the turbines.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Turbines are the most important

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
and the word turbines

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
means the stupid b-systems.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
As an example,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
let us consider a king.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
A king is a monosystem.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
It is one man.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
The natural development of events

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
implies

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
that two kings

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
appear instead of one.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Two kings on one throne,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
two kings in one state.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
This is a plot.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
We can develop some interesting plot lines

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
based on this.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
How does it happen that two kings

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
are in one kingdom?

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And they create their own plot line

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
that gives the work

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
to the famous three-body theory.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The first development

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
is two identical systems

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
in one union.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
For example,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
a gun was a single barrel,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
but became a double barrel.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
A system plus a sosystem.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
One of the varieties of b-systems.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
What does it mean?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
It means that if we consider

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
one king as a single system,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
then in the system of kingdoms

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
we take something adjacent to the king.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
For example,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
it can be a prince,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
a princess, a queen or a jester

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
that is always adjacent to the king.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And we say that the king and the jester are on the throne.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Or the king and the jester are in the crown.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
The king and the princess are on the throne.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
The king and the queen are on the throne.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Since we have already taken a gun,

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
let's think about a gun

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
and a sosystem of bayonets.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Or a gun

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
and some other thing

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
like a submachine gun.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
The next one

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
is a system and a non-system.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
We have to imagine

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
and attach to our system

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
some other system

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
that is not related to this system.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Thus, we can take

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
a king and a queen on the same throne.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Or a king and a queen on the same throne.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Or a king and a queen on the same throne.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
A gun

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
with an optical sight.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Or a gun

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
with a broom.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
The next one

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
is a non-system.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
It is when the systems are developing.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Sometimes

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
anti-systems are added to them.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
In our case,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
it can be a king and a jester on the same throne.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
A gun and a first aid kit in the same bottle.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Let's take a pencil as an example.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
We can see that the systems are developing in the same way.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
System 1 is a pencil.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
System 2 is a two-color pencil.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
On one side it is green.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
On the other side it is red.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Or blue.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
You must have seen such pencils

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
when you were in school,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
or when you were buying such products.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
The next one is a system plus a system.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
On one side it is a pencil.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
On the other side

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
it is a leg.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
It looks like a circular.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
What is the name of this leg?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
System and non-system.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
It is hard to imagine what it is.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
But I am sure that someone has seen

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
such a pencil.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
It looks like a decorative dagger.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
But this dagger has a griffin on the tip.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I don't know the functionality of this product.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
But it can be a souvenir

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
for a sailor or a soldier.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
You can say that you fought

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
and shed blood for this.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Now you can sign important documents.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And finally, the system plus the anti-system.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Everyone knows it.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Here is a pencil.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And here is a leg.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
You sign it and erase it.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Let's think.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Knowing the law,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
how does it work?

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Let's take any object

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
and see how we can develop it.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Or what we can offer to a newbie

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
for his development.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Any object.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Name any object.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
For example, a bottle.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I saw a bottle.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Let's see how it can develop.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
One bottle, one system.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
A bottle plus a bottle.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
You saw it in shops.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It's already developing.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
How can you use two bottles in one system?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Two objects for the price of one.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Most often. A gift for a purchase.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I remember. There is some kind of liqueur.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Exactly.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
There is some kind of liqueur.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
It's a chocolate liqueur.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
On one side it's chocolate, on the other side it's white.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
They are united in one part, but divided in two.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Here it's white, and here it's chocolate.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Two bottles in one bottle.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
A system plus its system.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
What is most often used with bottles?

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
A bottle of beer comes to mind.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
A bottle of beer with a bottle of beer.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
A salty fish.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
How can we use it?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
To promote our product.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
If we are beer sellers,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
we say not just a gift for a purchase,

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
but a gift for a purchase to our bottle of beer

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
you get one taranka.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Cool.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
There are more options.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
A bottle plus a bottle.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
A bottle of wine and a fougere.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
A cool idea.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
It's often used in shops.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Look, I took a bottle.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I'm serious. I didn't prepare for this.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
It's not a homemade workpiece.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
It's a system.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
We've seen it.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
A system plus its system.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Now a system and not a system.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
A bottle and something

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
that has nothing to do with a bottle.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
What can we see?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Anything. A bottle and a book.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
As they say,

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
don't get into a bottle and read a book.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
It's a good gift.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
A set. A student set.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
That's how we'll call it.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Next.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
A system plus an anti-system.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
In our country,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
we don't even raise our hands

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
to do something with a bottle.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
We don't even open it.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
For example, we take a bottle

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
that is destroyed

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
after all the liquid is squeezed out.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
There are bottles like this.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
There is plastic water in special bottles.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
There is water in plastic bottles.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
After using this water,

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
the bottle becomes smaller.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Exactly.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I think it's called Elion.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
If I remember correctly.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
The water is drunk,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
and the bottle is put together.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Many systems have already gone through this.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But many will only have to go through it.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
What system are you going to improve?

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
What object do you want to touch

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
or look at for strength?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
For the potential for innovation?

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Take any.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Run them through this scheme.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
See what can happen.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
What can manifest itself.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Laws of development are necessary for everyone.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Any system goes through the stage of B-system

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
into the field of system.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And we are moving on to the next

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
object or next tool

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
for the development of creative possibilities.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Let's take a look at it.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
All of us have heard

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
such consoles as

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
automoto, bike, photo, TV, video and others.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
So, the next technique

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
of B-system

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
or the convergence of two systems

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
that are in contact with each other

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
is called binom fantasy.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
In this case,

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
binom fantasy is one of the varieties

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
of the same turbos that we have just seen.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
So, we divide our sheet

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
by a vertical line.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
On the left side

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
we write down everything

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
that comes to our mind

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
when we hear the word

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
automoto.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
On the right side

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
we write down a list of random words

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
that come to our mind.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Please, try to do it.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
You have a hint on the slide.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I have a hint on the board.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I will have it shorter.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
You will have it longer.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I hope that everyone has managed to do it.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
So, what are we doing next?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
This method is good.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Why?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
To see something,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
to find a new application for the old one

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
or to find a new creative idea.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
What is it?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It is in simple terms

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
the development of the same creative imagination.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
You just need to combine

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
the left part

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
with the right part.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Each word is a separate combination.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
If I count

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I will get 35 combinations.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
It will be agro-sled, agro-carpet,

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
agro-kitchen, agro-socket, agro-nail,

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
agro-meat and agro-cat.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I will get 35 combinations.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I will combine

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
the other word

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
with all these combinations.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I will get

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
agro-socket, agro-socket,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
bio-socket, video-socket, multi-socket.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
This is starting to make me think.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I will do it with each word.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I will do it with each word.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
We can make conclusions.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
If we have a spark,

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
if we have a creative thought,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
we can give a reason

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
and find an application

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
of each word.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
This is our creative vein,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
our creative imagination.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
We talked about purposefulness.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
In any manifestation of creativity

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
we can show the consumer

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
why he needs the fruits of our creative imagination.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Let's look at one of these examples.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
For example, agro-socket.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
It is a socket for agronomy.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
It is a socket-extender on the field.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
A combine harvester can plug

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
its plug into this socket

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and charge the battery of the combine.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
This is a very necessary thing

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
in modern agriculture.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Especially considering the latest trends

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
that our government is preparing

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
for agricultural investments.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Our enterprise will soon be able

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
to earn an additional couple of million rubles

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
on these agro-sockets.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
We just need to look and think

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
how and who will be able

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
to use these agro-cables

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
to charge our agro-sockets.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
So,

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
let's look at a trend

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
called bio-sans.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
We all know

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
how popular

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
bio-toilets are today.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Our sans have gone far

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
and have become

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
the most popular

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
in their design and design

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
of the sans that are offered today.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
If the slide is very scary,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
you won't risk anything

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
even if you don't wear diapers.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
We have only considered

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
one word-combination

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
bio-sans,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
one word-combination agro-socket.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And we can find our own application

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
and our own purpose

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
and novelty from these words.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
For example,

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
what does a video-socket look like?

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
It's clear to everyone.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
A video-socket is a socket for a video-monitor,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
a TV-socket,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
or a TV-socket.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
There is an interesting application.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
You can make a video-monitor

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
that has fingers in it,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
and only then the video-monitor shows.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
It's a sadistic application.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
For example, for a camera.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
You want to watch TV?

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Here is a video-socket.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Aviomiaso!

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
It's a real achievement

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
of modern genetic engineering.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Can you imagine?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
In our collective farm

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
all chickens are made of aviomiaso.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
It's such a light and dietary meat

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
that you want to fly with it.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Of course, with the planes of famous airlines.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Multicooking.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
A kitchen where you can cook food

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
for all countries of the world.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Or a kitchen where representatives

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
of different nationalities can come

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and cook food there.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
So, everyone has their own kitchen.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And finally, what can we do?

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Aviadoyarka?

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
An interesting word.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
A promising one.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Aviadoyarka.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Does it milk the planes?

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Or does it milk the cows of the planes

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
of the famous airlines?

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
It's an interesting application.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
It's interesting.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I have a lot of thoughts.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
In both cases.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
If Aviadoyarka milks the planes,

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
what does it get from the planes?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Probably, milk.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
If it milks the cows of the planes,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
who are these cows?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
So, 35 words in total

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
and we already have some creative ideas.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
We are just experimenting.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
If you need an application

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
for this method,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
you take the product of your factory,

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
your enterprise,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
write it down instead of these random words

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
and make a table.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
In the vertical table you write down the words,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
in the horizontal table you write down the prefixes.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Agro, avia, bike, moto, photo, etc.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And you look at it.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
What can you get?

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And you think how to use it.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
For what?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Maybe for advertising purposes?

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Maybe for funny purposes?

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Maybe to create rumors?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Or to create the very fact that it was created?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
The rumors in the press have not disturbed anyone yet.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Both positive and negative.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
As one of my friends said,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
let them scold me on TV.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
It's good that they scold me.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
It's worse when they are silent.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Today they scold, tomorrow they praise.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
This method is well-known to everyone.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I hope that you will use this method

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
and this method quite often

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
and it will bring you the fame and success

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
that you deserve.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Moreover, it is quite easy to use.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Thank you very much.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Let's move on to the next one.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I just wanted to show

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
what success our students achieve

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
at our seminars.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
In this case, we see

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
electric toothpicks.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Toothpicks that everyone uses.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Everyone who lacks regular teeth.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
For example, you come to a restaurant

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and you are served meat.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
You say, this is horse meat.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
And they answer, no, we have eaten horse meat a long time ago.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
This is a saddle.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
In this case, you put on our electric toothpicks

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
and you have a shovel.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
It is necessary for any gold digger

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
to determine the place where it is now.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Telepasta.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
A paste that you can apply to your hand

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
and watch TV.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
A great paste.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Astropastukh.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Yes, I remember this.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
A brilliant invention.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
A spirit that sows consciousness.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
And stereo...

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Arfa.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Yes, indeed.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Why they are not available yet, no one knows.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Poor girls sit and play Arfa.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
One hand plays, the other holds.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
With two hands.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
A nose-cover.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
It is a crown that you can put on your head

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
and also carry in your pocket.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
In cold winter evenings

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
it will not let your feet freeze.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Rublya Tabak.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
If you are a successful person

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
and you smoke,

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
it is not clear why you do not smoke.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
You can not smoke.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Why do not you smoke our cigars?

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Wrapped in money.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Pastoklop.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
You will find an application for this small tube.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Vydrodelfin.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
It is similar to a biodegradable drug.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
It is its pet.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Bolt-a-zond.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
It is a very useful thing.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Especially for a choric.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
You know, for street restaurants and cafes.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Not just umbrellas,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
but umbrellas that turn into asphalt.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
And thus better hold.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Not a single gust of wind can carry this umbrella.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Ways of use.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And the type of existence of other objects

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
depicted on this slide,

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
you can think about it yourself.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
This is the development of creative armament

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and creativity.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Find unexpected combinations,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
unexpected objects among themselves

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
and find their application.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
For example, a casket for lovers.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Walking in the starry night evenings

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
you put on

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
your favorite, not a wreath of daisies,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
but a busto helmet.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
You put on the second helmet

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
and listen to your favorite music

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
through the speakers located

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
and twist the volume

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
and music through the settings

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
located at the top.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I have a disposable cup in my hands

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
and I have a disposable cup.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Everyone probably knows what it is.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Everyone has used it in many offices,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
institutes, cafes.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
There is a similar disposable dish.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
It would seem that this is a brilliant invention.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
The one who invented and began to implement

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
most likely became a millionaire.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
You constantly think,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
where do such thoughts come from?

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
This is a piece of sugar.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Not a piece, but a bag of sugar

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
that I need to use,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
so that my tea or coffee,

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
depending on what I pour into this cup,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
is sweet.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
To do this, I need to tear this bag,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
pour it here and find a spoon somewhere.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Look, the person who invented

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
or came up with the idea

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
probably is not in trouble now.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Just like those companies that

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
produce these bags in millions.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
In every cafe, in every plane,

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
in every plane, in every train,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
in every ship there are such bags.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
They are everywhere, wherever we go,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
in any bistro.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
And in order to solve the problem

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
with mixing sugar,

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
he invented a spoon

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
with which we can mix

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
this sugar from our bag.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
The method we have just gone through,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
the B-system method,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
allows us to combine the incompatible.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
And it is true.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
In 2003,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
at the Academy of State Service

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
under the Presidency of the Russian Federation,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
we were discussing

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
the B-system method.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
And combining the incompatible,

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
my students came up with the idea

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
why not to combine

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
a disposable spoon

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
with a disposable piece of sugar.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
In order to tear the bag,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
we would not have a piece of sugar

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
that we put into this tea

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
and drink it.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
What a gigantic market is opening up before us!

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Yes, one piece of sugar

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
costs a penny,

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
but with millions of copies

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
it allows us to get rich.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And what do you think?

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Thus,

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
it was decided that the idea was cool,

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
but in a couple of months

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
or in three or four years,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I do not remember exactly,

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I went to one of the Moscow restaurants

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
and ordered a dessert, tea, coffee.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
And on the tray I was brought

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
what do you think?

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
The invention of my students.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
This is a stick,

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
but it has sugar at the end.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I asked the teacher

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
to bring me more.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
And I was brought.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I did not believe my eyes.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I asked, do you do it yourself?

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Because if you look closely,

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
in fact, there are quite rough pieces of burnt sugar.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
They said, no, we buy.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
They did not answer my question where.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And only in December 2006,

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
having visited the MacMason University in London,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
the Queen herself

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
I found there a similar work of art.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Indeed, here it is realized.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
A piece of sugar on a stick.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
So far, only in the premium segment.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
In the economy class.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
You, my dear,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
especially if you work in this industry,

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
still have a chance

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
to get rich and become rich.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
So, dare.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Dear listeners, colleagues, viewers,

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
thank you for your attention.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I hope you were interested

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
to spend this time with me.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
I, on my part, hope that we will meet again.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
These are not the last and not the first topics

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
that we will discuss.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
And most likely you will meet me

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
in the near future.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
I wish you to develop yourself,

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
develop your creative imagination,

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
develop your innovative abilities

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
and achieve success

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
together with you and with us.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Thank you very much for your attention.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Goodbye. See you soon.
