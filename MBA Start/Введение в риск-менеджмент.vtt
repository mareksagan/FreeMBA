WEBVTT

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.710
My name is Roman Makiev, I am

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.730
the head of the operational audit

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.890
department in a large thermostat company.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.730
Today's course is based

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.830
on my previous experience.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.810
I worked in consulting for 6 years,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.210
the last is my position and from

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.430
the head of the direction, including

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310
the direction of risk management.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.030
And based on experience, there was

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.610
an introductory course in risk

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.870
management, in which I will stop on

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.170
how to apply risk management in your

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.770
company including.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.570
Before I start the course, I will tell

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.910
you a few stories.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.350
History the first.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.730
There are problems in one

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.730
business all the time.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.850
For example, in the part of the strategy,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.210
that is, the region, it turned out

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.190
that the market capacity in this region

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.990
was 4 times smaller than planned.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.110
Because of the fact that a currency contract

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.310
was concluded, they lost half of

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.770
their profits due to the fall of the dollar.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.190
Because of the fact that the seller

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.070
resigned, they lost almost a third

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.790
of the sales.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.490
The accountant departed, the accountant

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.990
department collapsed.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.490
All data was lost in electronic

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030
form, including customer contacts.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.050
The inventory of the warehouse showed that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.310
50 million

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.850
Ruby is missing, and it is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.630
completely unclear to whom to hang it.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.310
All this happens in a half year.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.450
The business owner just doesn't know

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.430
what to do, works like a sort of anti-

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.990
crisis manager and, in general,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.070
thinks, in the end, rather than

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.250
whether to sell this business

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.990
at all.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.970
Another situation.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.230
The situation, when everything in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.270
the business is good, stable growth, and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670
stable growth in the last 5 years, there

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.990
are no special problems.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.150
But again, and the owner

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.970
and the CEO, each top manager

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.470
tells you that if you do not

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.330
do anything right now, then

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
everything will be very bad.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.390
That is, markets are falling,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.750
production is aging, there is no staff.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.770
The owner understands that

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.550
healthy grain is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.190
in what sequence, he

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.190
can not determine.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.330
At the same time, if you collect

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.010
all the wishes, who needs money,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.010
then no money will be enough.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.730
These two situations, you may not have

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.450
met them, but there is a situation

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.710
number 3.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.270
Have you ever wondered why

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.250
projects don't work out?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.290
They are, of course, not fulfilled

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.750
because they did not guess with

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.090
the market, that is, they

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.210
were wrongly predicted.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.990
But this happens quite rarely.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.970
Financial calculations, such

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.990
as arithmetic errors, of course,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.570
occur, but they are not the cause.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.770
That is, it seems like a good project, it

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.610
seems like a good manager of such a project,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.330
but something is going wrong.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.770
This is not the case with the direct losses

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.510
of the company.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.210
That is, the project was unsuccessful.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.370
What does all these three situations

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.210
combine?

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.790
All three situations are combined

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.350
by the fact that a risk management

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.350
system, if it exists, can either

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.890
prevent them or minimize

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.810
their consequences.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.750
This is the solution to such situations

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.530
and will be devoted to today's course,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.290
which will be called “Introduction to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.770
Risk Management”.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.190
This is precisely the “Introduction

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.090
to Risk Management”, that is, I will

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.990
not put but nevertheless, we will

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.350
consider the main actions when setting

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.610
up a risk management system,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.270
in particular, how to identify

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.110
risks, how to calculate them.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.070
We will build a risk map, I will

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.610
teach you how you can build this

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.270
risk map, develop activities

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.950
programmes, use

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.650
risk management decision

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.690
making.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.430
Well, in conclusion, I will tell you

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.890
about how to quickly put it, that

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.010
is, this will be advice based on first

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.270
of all consultative practice.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.860
The course is called “Introduction

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.780
to Risk Management”, first I will

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.760
tell you what Risk Management

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.000
is and give you the main terms

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.340
and definitions.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.500
Next, we will fully look at the company

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.300
standard, that is, we will consider

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.460
how risks are identified, how they

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.240
are assigned the value of probability

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.140
and damage, how risk maps

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.940
are formed, what they are,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.220
how the risk management program

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.080
should look, the program

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.260
of risk management

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.340
activities.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.280
I will give an example of taking decisions

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.600
taking into account risks.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.900
In conclusion, I will give some advice,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.440
consider the organizational

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.980
structure of risk management, who

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.940
should take them, what should be the

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.300
sequence of actions of management

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.680
if management wants to avoid

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.860
those situations that I mentioned

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.380
in the introduction.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.900
In conclusion, I will give a few advice.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.660
The main goal I pursue

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.060
in this video course

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.060
is that each student can

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.880
make his first risk

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.700
map after the course.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.720
I warn you immediately that it will probably

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.440
not be very accurate, but since risk

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.500
management is not a quick matter,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.660
less than six months a year to learn

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.520
to understand all your risks and

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.160
more so to learn to manage them

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.640
in general is simply unrealistic,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.880
in general it is normal,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.620
still to return to the previous

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.080
one.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.730
But in the end, this video course will help to start.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.510
Let us start with the definitions

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.830
of what is risk management.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.070
I will use the simplest definitions.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.910
There are a lot of definitions.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.630
The simplest, I think, definitions

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.090
are given to the standard company.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.050
Risk is a combination of the probability of

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.910
events and their consequences.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.190
You can see that it is short,

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.430
if you think, then most of both

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.190
negative and positive events

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.990
fall under this definition.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.490
An event is the occurrence of

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.510
a certain conjunction of circumstances.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.750
Risk management is coordinated

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.510
action to guide and control

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.590
an organization in areas

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.610
related to risk.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.950
Risk management system is a set of

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.850
elements of the management

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.910
system of an organization

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.010
related to risk

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.050
management.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.630
In general, simple and understandable.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.110
Standard of the company.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.670
How is the company decoded?

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.350
The company is a federation of European

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.630
risk managers associations.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.050
By the first letters you can

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.690
create a company.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.730
Risk management has been introduced

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.270
relatively recently.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.030
This is the 21st century.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.850
Standards are not strictly

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.010
approved standards.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.130
Unlike the risk management standards

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.270
for banks in Basel, which are

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.270
mandatory in some countries.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.930
These are the recommendations

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.810
that will allow a risk management

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.810
system.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.550
These recommendations take very

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.930
little in volume.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.950
That is, it is literally 16 pages.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.410
They appeared in 2002, the initiator

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.490
of development was the British.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.570
This is the creation of the entire

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.010
Federation.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.310
There is a short translation

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.730
in Russian, but I do

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.030
not recommend using it.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.950
Why is?

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.130
I will tell further.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.890
You can see the name below.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.970
How does the standard define the objectives

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.710
and tasks of risk management?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.030
He also defines them as simply as possible.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.170
The goal of risk management is

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.370
to give maximum sustainability to

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.410
all activities of the organization.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.490
The main task of risk management is

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.330
identification, that is, identifying

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.110
risks and impacting them.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.730
A distinctive feature

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.430
of modern risk management

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.450
is that not only negative

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.010
risks are considered,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.790
but positive ones too.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.670
What is Positive Risk?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.630
This is the use of business

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.930
opportunities.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.190
For example, you have a trading

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.710
network, you sell something there,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.790
on those same squares you can also

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.690
sell not only that, but something else.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.070
This is an opportunity.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.930
You can go to another region,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.490
that is an opportunity.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.950
You can launch a new product, that'

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.430
s the opportunity.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.870
This is how the risks are interpreted

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.910
by modern standards.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.050
How does the risk management process define

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.450
the company's standard?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.770
It all starts with strategic goals.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.750
As one of my colleagues says,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.230
a company without a strategy is a set

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.170
of assets loaded with liabilities.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.110
If the company has no strategy, if

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.510
the owners do not understand what they

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.270
want to see from the company in 3-5 years,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.170
then to say what the risks will

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.710
be quite difficult, because if we

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.370
do not know where to go, it is impossible

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.770
to say what awaits us on the

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.910
way.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.650
Russian practice says that a small

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.830
number of companies have a

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.190
strategy in general.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.230
They understand that in 3-5 years,

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.230
what should look like a business,

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.190
even fewer companies have

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.070
a formalized strategy so that

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.350
you can take it and read it.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.890
This does not mean that the

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.810
risk management system should stop

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.210
putting, just you will have a significant

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.850
amount of risks associated

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.890
with the uncertainty

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.130
of the strategy.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.210
Uncertainty can be very different,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.090
and the consequences can also be very

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.550
different, let's look at a

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.410
little below.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.930
Based on the results of the strategy, as

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.950
well as the results of the analysis of the current

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.090
state, you should make a risk diagnosis.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.450
The risk assessment consists of three parts.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.110
The first part is the identification of risks

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.490
and their description.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.810
This is called risk analysis.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.810
As part of this procedure, this

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.730
procedure is one of the longest at the

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.550
stage of establishing a risk

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.950
management system.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.230
It is to her that we will pay special attention.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.470
We need to get a very detailed description

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.190
of everything that first

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.330
threatens the organization, that

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.850
is, negative risks.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.550
The second, which opportunities

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.850
are not used, is the positive risks.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.750
The more detailed the description, the easier

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.830
it will be to form a program of activities.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.490
Once we have all these risks described,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.290
we must calculate them.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.610
I always aim to

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.170
quantify the risks.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.170
What is the probability in percentage,

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.770
what is the damage in millions of rubles,

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.530
in millions of dollars.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.850
Maybe a qualitative description, but

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.230
we will stop later.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.530
The very important point of the calculation

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.530
is to assess the risks, that is, to

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.450
determine their acceptability for

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.310
the organization.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.470
Here very often confuse calculation and estimation,

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.610
in general, there is nothing

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.630
terrible about it.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.790
But in this course, we will understood

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.630
the calculation of the assignment of

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.110
the value of probability and damage or consequences,

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.510
and under the evaluation this comparison

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.510
with some criteria and the determination

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.950
of the acceptability or inadmissibility

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.910
of risk for the organization.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.870
The first document, called

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.050
the “Risk Report”,

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.810
should be produced.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.270
This report, which should be considered

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:22.630
and specified including all risks,

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.870
and the Board of Directors should

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.410
actually determine the acceptability

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.470
on the basis of that report.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.910
It happens a little differently, but

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.670
the standard is exactly like that.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.850
On the basis of this report and

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.130
the Board of Directors' decision,

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.830
a risk management measure is being

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.230
developed, and a second document is

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.810
being developed – a risk management

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.890
program.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.590
In general, the entire risk

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.310
management process, except for what

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.350
is necessary to close it up

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.650
with some monitoring of

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.650
results, and on the basis

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.550
of monitoring, it is natural

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.910
that the risks are always

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.130
re-identified.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.230
That is, the risk card actually lives

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.650
for 1, 2, 3 months.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.750
That is, any decision, any change

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.950
in the external environment leads

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.430
to a change in the risk map often

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.570
significant.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.710
And this is a closed process, and

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.890
there is a risk management process,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.390
and this process will avoid

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:26.170
negative consequences and use

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.430
the opportunities available for

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.970
any organization.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.330
The company standard defines four types

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.450
of risk.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.530
These are strategic risks,

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.090
financial risks, operational

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.830
risks and hazards risks.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.010
They can have both these and two other

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.390
factors of occurrence.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.850
These are external factors and internal factors.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.270
Let us look at the existing

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.110
risks a little more detailedly.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.130
Strategic risks are the most difficult

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.210
to identify risks, they are the largest

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.310
in scale, that is, the most damaging

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.910
risks for the organization.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.010
First of all, they naturally include

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.330
the risks associated with the external

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.110
environment.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.550
This is competition, it is a change

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.630
in industry legislation.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.810
Related to the internal environment

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.450
is the absence of new developments.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.510
The most difficult to calculate are financial

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.710
risks, these are currency rates, these

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.770
are interest risks, these are

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.390
credit risks.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.370
Operational risks are usually

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.490
the most.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.330
These risks are related

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.990
to business processes, these risks

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.930
are related to information systems.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.550
The risks are traditional.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.230
They all understand them best.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.070
These are fires, floods and hurricanes.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.230
Such a specific risk for Russia

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.670
is the risk of unfriendly absorption.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.150
All risks are associated with theft, all

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.570
risks are dangerous.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.570
In fact, they are most understandable,

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.670
as are the financial risks the

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.390
easiest to understand.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.910
In terms of financial risks, it

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.790
is there,, the greatest mathematics,

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.010
the most complex mathematics,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.370
we will not specially

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.710
stop at them, that is,

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.270
simply list.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.710
More attention is paid

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.990
to strategic and operational

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.050
risks.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.430
Why is?

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.390
Because they are the most difficult

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.810
to detect, they are far from obvious.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.390
That is, if the list of financial risks

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.250
is universal, the list of risks

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.790
of dangers is simple enough

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.310
to form, then the list of strategic

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.970
risks and operational

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.850
risks is the most difficult.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.870
Speaking about the risks, one

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.850
should mention another, the most

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.130
popular standard.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.370
This standard is called COSA ERM.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.730
It looks like a standard firm

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.490
in something, but in fact all

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.270
standards, as about the same thing,

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.250
in many ways cross.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.570
In part, the standard itself

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.930
is an audit standard.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.170
For me as an auditor, it is very

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.730
useful, but it is written by

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.810
auditors for auditors, in general,

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.510
this determines some complexity

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.290
of its use in ordinary life by

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.150
ordinary people.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.370
Let us briefly explain what it is

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.090
made of.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.290
First, each organization should

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.850
determine the level of pitit risk,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.030
that is, what risk it is willing

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.670
to take when making strategic

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.110
decisions.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.630
On the basis of this certain level,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.330
decisions should be made

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.390
that do not exceed this risk.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.450
Improving decision-making on risk

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.050
response, setting up a risk

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.630
management system, reducing

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.370
the number of unforeseen

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.390
events and losses, defining the

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:12.310
management of the entire set

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.490
of risks, using favorable

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.990
opportunities, not only negative

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.170
but also positive risks,

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.690
and rational use of capital,

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.770
is meant not only to whom how much

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.910
money to give, but also to

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.750
determine the capital

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.530
needs for the sustainable

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.190
development of the company.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.510
There is always a cube in these standards,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.890
it is represented on the right side of the

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:05.490
slide, the types of targets on which

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.150
the organization can take some risks.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.390
Two types of goals, strategic goals,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.250
operational goals, they coincide

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.350
with the standard of the firm.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.810
The other two types of goals, the reporting

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.150
goals and the objectives in

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.230
the field of current

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.450
legislation, are taken from the

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.310
definition of internal control.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.110
It doesn't matter what the classification

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.230
of goals or the classification

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.250
of types of risk is, it's just the standard

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.350
of the cost.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.550
Special attention is paid to the

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.230
latter two, because the ERM is the

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.430
development of the standard of the

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.470
integrated framework.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.410
It is clear that, however, internal

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.930
audit and internal control for

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.050
an organization that is public, that

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.610
is, the stock is listed on the stock

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.990
exchange, is primarily the reliability

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.670
of reporting and compliance

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.750
with the legislation.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.610
What is risk management, this is

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:18.150
the second axis, it is the analysis

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.470
of the internal and external environment,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.870
it is the setting of goals, that is,

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.430
what goals the organization should,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.930
it is the definition of events, it is the

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.790
identification of risks, that is, there

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.930
are difficulties of translation,

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.190
it is the assessment of risks, that is,

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.290
the assessment of their acceptability,

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.170
it is the method of responding to risk,

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.290
what means of control, communication

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.190
information and the same monitoring.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.790
If you pay attention, it is in many

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.870
ways the same, but there are three such

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.650
principled things in the case, these are

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.450
goals, risks, controls.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.050
Unfortunately, in what this

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:02.090
degenerates, it degenerates into

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.430
a very detailed analysis of absolutely

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:10.530
all-all When considering each

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.870
business process, depending

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.150
on the level, there is a huge

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.750
amount of risks.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.990
In general, again, I, as an auditor,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.750
work with this very conveniently, on

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.130
the board of directors, the results

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.450
of the application of the ERM, in

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.430
general, in my opinion, to pull,

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.250
to represent not very well.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.650
Well, the third, it symbolizes the

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.010
fact that each division is involved

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.530
in the risk management system,

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.230
this is also actually a standard

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.770
firm, I will tell you a little further.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.730
So before we go to the direct

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.590
risk management procedures,

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.450
let us summarize

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.130
what is risk.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.970
Risk is a combination of the probability of

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.570
events and their consequences.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.790
The goal of risk management is

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.470
to give maximum sustainability to

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.430
all activities of the organization.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.670
The main task of risk management

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.490
is to identify risks and

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.510
impact them.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.470
There are two of the most popular

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.830
risk management standards.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.930
There are more standards, of course,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.430
including Russian, but two are most

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.430
often used - either the Federation

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.030
of the European Association

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.810
of Risk Managers or COSA ERM.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.710
The COSA ERM standard is mandatory

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.030
for public companies,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.490
for American public companies.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.410
In general, if you are not going to be

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.670
on the US stock exchange in the next

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.590
3-5 years, then it is not mandatory for you.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.090
In ordinary life, it is a little more

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.510
complex than a standard firm, primarily

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.610
because it does not contain

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.230
an algorithm of action.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.790
The standard firm contains a detailed

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.690
description of the actions, so

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.250
it is more easily applied without

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.790
special training.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.610
The standard firm strictly defines

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.010
the sequence of actions, because

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.610
we know that this is not a standard,

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.350
it is recommendations, then if

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.670
we will deviate from them a little,

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:15.930
then nothing terrible will

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:16.350
be.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.280
Let's start with the identification

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.420
and methods that exist.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.180
In fact, the methods

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.460
of identification are many.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.020
I have grouped them into

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.860
three basic categories.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.520
This is not, again, some truth

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.040
in the last instance.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.300
Let's start with the methods that are

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.520
devoted to business analysis.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.200
The first, the simplest, the most familiar

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.600
is the swedish analysis.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.100
I will not stop in detail on it,

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.640
because since you are studying

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.000
for an MBA, you should know.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.520
The only thing I will say is that such

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.220
a traditional swed-analysis, which

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.940
often occurs, is written within 10-

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.220
15 minutes, it is not a

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.160
normal swed-analysis, and it will

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.020
not help to identify risks.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.160
Remember that there are threats and there are opportunities.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.880
If you detail them as part

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.520
of the swedish analysis, they

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.580
will be your risks both negative

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.660
and positive.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.440
The next type of possible business

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.000
analysis is course analysis, that

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
is, business-political,

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.800
economic, social-technological.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.320
Together with the following, that

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.360
is, esp analysis, political,

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:42.980
economic, socio-

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.980
technological, legal, environmental,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.780
it is the consideration of

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.680
all aspects of business from

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.860
these positions.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.600
It is very effective for identifying

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.240
strategic risks, very effective

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.560
in terms of coverage completeness,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.980
in terms of meaningful

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.320
risks that can be seen.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.000
For operational risks, I recommend

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.060
using business processes.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.840
There can be a lot of risks,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.080
so I will show you how

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.940
to reduce them.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.000
A very important method of risk analysis

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.980
is the analysis of business continuity.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.040
Business continuity analysis

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.460
is based on the fact that we model

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.540
a situation that can lead to a stop.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.620
The situation can be very

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.660
different, for example, power

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.340
outages, fire.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.940
But there are more significant things,

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.040
such as unfriendly acquisition,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.380
such as the fall of some

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.120
markets.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.900
We model what we can do, form

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.580
a business continuity plan.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.580
The next method is the analysis

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.820
of production systems.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.380
I will not stop in the lesson in detail on

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.000
them, everything will be in the textbook

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.660
their description.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.100
In general, the methods are universal, but

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.420
the identified risks will vary greatly

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.420
from industry to industry.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.700
The following methods of identification

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.080
of risks are organizational methods,

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.860
these are favorite

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.260
consulting methods.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.380
I will stop at them in detail, because

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.360
you will have to use them

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.980
all in one way or another.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.700
First is the questionnaire.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.220
You form a questionnaire, the simplest

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.360
questionnaire is what risks are,

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.160
the number of cases per year,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.140
and you spread among

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.480
the maximum number of people.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.360
Why does the method not work well?

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.740
First, as with any questionnaire from

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.380
the outside, no matter what, whether

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.160
it is a psychologist, the attitude is very specific.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.180
I assure you, if you give, then the case

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.900
of falling brick on the head will be

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.920
listed in each second questionnaire.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.180
Few people see the big strategic

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.560
risks.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.720
The risks may be

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.500
identified somehow.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.280
However, the method is useful

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.980
because there are one, two, three

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.700
risks that are specific

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.060
to this organization, which

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.700
you may not know even with your

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.260
risk base, and it may fall

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.580
into the questionnaire.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.360
The next method is working groups.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.680
The most effective method is to gather

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.320
5-6 people in one place who sincerely

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.740
want to learn about risk management,

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.060
sincerely care about the

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.660
future of their organization.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.760
Along with a good moderator who should

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.680
be there, a risk manager can

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.280
act, the results will be very

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.640
good in the right direction,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.260
when telling about certain

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.920
methods of indoctrination.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.420
A group of people living at the enterprise

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.320
will be happy to tell you everything

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.040
during the afternoon.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.780
Here, brain attack is a variant

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:33.560
of the working group method.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.460
In a brain attack, everyone sits in

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.160
a circle and starts to attack.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.920
It all depends on the moderator.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.020
If the moderator is good, he can direct

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.480
the group, then throwing the idea into the

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.500
crowd, he will do everything himself.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.940
If the moderator is not qualified

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.320
enough, a traditional date

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.120
for brain strokes may occur.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.140
They sat for half a day, not revealing

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.860
anything, but they talked.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.580
A very important audit method.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.420
When identifying risks, first

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.260
require all audit reports.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.400
I am not only talking about the audit

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.840
reports of the external audit

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.780
report, but also about the results of

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.040
the internal audit, the results of the

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.040
environmental audit, the

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.960
results of the technological audit.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.280
They meet up.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.860
Reports are large, the key risks you will

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.580
definitely find out about them.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.180
What methods to use?

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.640
The answer is simple.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.620
Apply all, both organizational and

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.220
analytical, and for production

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.280
method of analysis of production

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.280
systems.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.120
There is some specificity in their

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.020
application, but after applying all,

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.860
I think you will close the risk with

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.280
a good 80-95% probability.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.560
The key is identification of risks.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.680
Although risk identification can

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.120
be carried out by independent

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.880
consultants, an assessment

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.360
carried out within the company,

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.220
with close interaction of its services,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:15.920
with consistent

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.260
and coordinated use of the

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.420
processes and tools presented,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.820
is likely to be more

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.880
effective.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.240
What does this mean?

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.240
This means that it is possible to determine

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.740
the risk, but using the knowledge

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.660
of the organization itself,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.180
using the knowledge of employees,

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.260
this assessment will be

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.560
more effective.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.100
Why not read the Russian

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.440
translation?

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.760
In Russian translation, of course,

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.380
consultants wrote, so this phrase

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:51.220
is replaced by the phrase that

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.640
risk assessment is usually carried

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.020
out by external consultants.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.160
Everyone makes money as they can.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.860
An external consultant can greatly

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.060
speed up this process.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.260
Practice shows that 1-2 months

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.760
with the help of an external

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.340
consultant - it can even be a lot, if

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.760
without it, then the procedure less

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.760
than two months is unlikely to take.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.120
But, nevertheless, always remember

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.800
that you need to work closely

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.100
with the entire management

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.560
of the organization, with all the staff.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.920
It will be more efficient.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.060
To identify risks,

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.800
to identify them.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.580
First, we need a business strategy.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.220
If there is no formalized strategy,

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.320
then a series of interviews will be required.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.820
If there are more than one owners,

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.600
you will see that they are likely

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.140
to have a different view of the company'

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.080
s development.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.520
This can also identify

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.100
certain risks.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.000
The second thing that will be needed is all

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.720
the data on the economy.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.160
First, the industry data,

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.020
macroeconomic data.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.440
How the industry lives, what is its

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.320
position, is there no threat from external

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.320
big for the industry as a whole.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.480
Second, at least the reporting.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.600
Reporting is better management, reporting

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.760
is better with decryptions.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.540
You will most likely need a product

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:26.280
margin to identify such threats

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.220
related to the current position

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.980
in the market.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.280
In Russia, traditionally, data on

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.320
the scheme of financial

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.240
and economic activity,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.480
on the legal structure are needed.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.300
Needed for what?

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.600
Assessment of tax risks.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.680
Unfortunately, most of our

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.320
use different tax optimization

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.020
methods, including not

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.360
very legal ones.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.300
To assess the risks, you need to understand the

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.620
scale of the disaster.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.460
Information about the management system is very important.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.040
Organic structure, processes,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.340
internal control – all of this

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.860
needs to be analyzed to identify

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.540
risks.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.180
The traditional problem

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.100
of organ structure is when

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.300
one top management has

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.860
both planning, accounting,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.120
analysis and execution.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.480
The problem of processes

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.540
is the lack of any internal control.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.960
Since I am an internal auditor and

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.480
have worked as a consultant before,

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.540
I can say about absolutely every business

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.160
that the excellence of

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.640
non-internal control can reduce

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.160
a significant amount of current

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.800
risks.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.660
Regulation of certain processes

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.140
and clear implementation will

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.720
reduce the likelihood of problems

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.320
many times.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.460
If the production business and trade

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.500
too, then this state of equipment,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:14.820
the audit data, which the audit

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.340
revealed.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.380
In the case of a strong internal

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.280
auditor in the company, it

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.000
may be that everything else is

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.840
not needed, because as part

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.900
of the audit function, the above

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.820
is checked and familiarity

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.000
with the audit reports will allow

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.880
you to easily

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.380
identify risks.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:41.120
This list is not complete, the list

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.780
is determined each time.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.740
You will face the risk of

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.220
identifying that you will

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.640
always need some information.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.200
Information can be very different,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.920
from the decoding of the report to the

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.720
year of release of a particular compressor.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.580
Don't be ashamed, ask, you'

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.860
ll have to run.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.840
Let us go to the example.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.540
A conditionally-mechanical plant, the

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.520
example concerns not only the identification

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.780
of risks, but also all subsequent

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.860
actions to set up risk management

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.040
systems.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.840
A usual small factory, located

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.940
in a small village of the urban

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.180
type, a stable position in

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.060
some market, here is written "monopoly",

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.640
in fact under "monopoly" is

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.080
understood that it clearly occupies

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.140
more than half the market,

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.420
such a good factory.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.440
Such ones really exist.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.240
A large number of workers, 5,000

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.180
of 60, is clearly a

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.080
city-forming enterprise.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.500
To simplify, let's assume that it is

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.980
a public company, that is, the shares

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.840
are quoted, say, in RTS.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.040
Capitalization is not very large, such

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.760
enterprises are actually not, but for

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.940
simplification is suggested.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.200
The revenue is 4 billion rubles,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.260
net profit is 400 million.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.420
Consider as an example, how on the

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.600
basis of pistoleanalytics

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.400
to identify the risks of such

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.040
a small enterprise.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.440
The first letter of the “P” is politics.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.180
We will start with my favorite

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.060
method of pistol, look at each

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.000
letter and try to understand

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.440
what could threaten

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.800
the plant.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.380
It starts with the letter “P”

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.940
– political analysis.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.160
In general, political analysis is traditionally

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.100
associated with strange, that is,

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.740
country risk.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.280
If we go to Africa, and in Africa

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.600
the government changes

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.000
frequently enough, war often

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.800
enough, that is actually

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.160
a political risk.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.380
In Russia, everything is much easier,

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.840
in Russia, every business depends

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.520
on the governor, depends

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.960
on the legislative assembly, depends

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.940
on the executive, so the first

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.220
risk that is is a change of

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.360
the governor.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.300
Let us consider the economy.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.560
Here I will look at not only the economy,

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.280
but also business, because this is an

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.920
element of BPS analysis.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.660
What is threatening the economy?

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.200
First, the increased competition,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.860
the competition in our

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.080
local markets.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.060
Separately, I suggest considering

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.380
the risk that the enterprise is, of

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.080
course, a monopoly, but there are

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.900
some factories that are trying to compete.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.400
In Russia, it is unlikely that

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.540
anyone will succeed, but if

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.040
our competitor is bought by foreign

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.260
companies that are also

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.780
specialized in these markets,

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.500
then we can get a fairly large

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.580
number of problems.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.140
If we are not ready for this, then

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.620
we and the market can get out very

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.640
quickly.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.420
This risk is also very specific,

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.580
when the profitability

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.280
of the whole industry drops

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.680
significantly.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.660
The risk is for almost all industries.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.220
The fact is that in the late 1990s,

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.900
trade rarely worked at a rate

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.400
of less than 100%.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.600
In general, with increased competition

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.260
such a raspberries will almost not remain.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.340
And you need to be prepared for

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.920
the fact that if you have an

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.700
ebedda rate of 50%, then most likely

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.180
in a few years it will fall to

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.760
20-30%, if you do not take

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.860
any measures.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.800
The next letter is the letter S, which

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.080
is social analysis.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.740
There is also a lot of talk

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.800
about social responsibility.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.820
You understand that in a town-type

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.880
settlement, urban enterprises are

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.480
more than socially responsible,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.620
so consider such a risk as the increase

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.880
in costs for the maintenance

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.280
of the social sphere.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.540
In fact, there may be

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.000
such a remarkable risk in

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.260
social commitments as the inability

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.720
to dismiss excess staff,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.380
but as far as I know, this

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.420
risk is not very relevant

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.520
for most now.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.020
But the growth of the costs ofining

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.440
the social sphere is more

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.180
than a real risk, that

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.840
is, the urban enterprises should

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.200
be prepared for what everything

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.580
from playgrounds to repair

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.780
of communications in this

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.360
village will have to do.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.040
The following risks are

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.120
technological, letter T.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.340
Let us identify such risks as the

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.460
lag behind of the technologies used.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.340
What is Risk?

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.200
The risk is due to the fact that

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.560
the energy intensity is significantly higher

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.580
than the competitors.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.440
A good example is aviation.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.980
While petroleum was cheap, our

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.220
aircraft, even the old ones, were quite competitive.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.200
Now, when the difference between the Tu-

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.800
154 and the Boeing 737 is about twice

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.440
the fuel consumption, the Tu-154 is

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.760
clearly less competitive.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.260
In addition to the lag behind in

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.060
the technologies used, the lack of

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.920
new products is also a technological risk.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.140
The fact is that every product has a

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.100
life cycle, a writing machine,

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.580
an audio player, a cassette.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.940
If we don't have a new product,

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.800
it will lead to the fact that the

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.440
business will actually stop.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.840
We will consider that for our conditional

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.580
plant this risk is also very

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.380
relevant.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.120
The next letter, letter L, is

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.660
a legal risk.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.900
We are looking at changes

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.260
in industry legislation.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.420
There are a few examples from the

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.840
recent past, i.e. the beginning of the 21st

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.860
century.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.900
First, the pharmaceutical markets, that

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.840
is, production must be certified

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.980
according to the new standards.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.860
For many it was

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.280
quite tense.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.680
There are changes in the construction

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.660
market, there are changes in the engine

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.860
production market, but there will

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.660
be changes in other industries.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.540
We will consider that this is also threatening

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.460
for our factory.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:34.360
The letter E is ecology.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.780
This is a very typical risk associated

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.320
with the use of the water environment.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.000
The ban on the discharge of springwater,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.120
you understand what it is

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.980
for an industrial enterprise, it

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.020
is actually its stop, or huge investments

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.720
in the creation of a closed

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.980
circuit.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.420
The expansion of the pistole analysis, the booklets

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:04.420
E and D, is education and demography.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.320
So, in the part of education, everyone

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.300
knows that the PTU system has collapsed,

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.100
the school system is becoming

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.740
as if it is getting worse and worse,

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.640
there is a lack of qualified personnel,

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.780
especially the lack of qualified

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.360
personnel when working

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.980
on complex equipment.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.900
Therefore, for our mechanical plant

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.340
there is a risk of lack of personnel

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.660
with the required qualifications.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.060
While we only mean engineers

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.880
and workers, the risk is actually

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.880
wider.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.700
That is, the risk concerns, say, for trading

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.260
companies, these are sellers,

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.640
trade representatives.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.460
For all companies that plan

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.120
to form reporting, it is a shortage

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.660
of accountants who know international

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.700
standards.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.560
In general, in Russia, the transition

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.180
can happen very quickly on them and

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.500
this is the problem, that is, every

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.300
business will get problems with

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.140
the fact that it can not form the

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.360
reporting there properly.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.040
I will focus on the letter D.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.400
The letter D is demography.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.840
Everyone knows that in the

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.580
1990s we had some failure

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.060
in birth.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.160
That is, in the 93rd year, relative

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.500
to the 88th year, the birth rate fell

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.000
almost twice and the number, if

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.160
you look at the data in the state statistics,

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.700
the number of 15-19-year-olds,

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.360
is about twice the number

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.620
of 20-25-year-olds.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.740
And this decline, it will affect

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.780
absolutely every business.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.940
The simple thing is that in different

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.300
differently, that is, those that

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.740
prefer to recruit young people,

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.160
it will affect already there in

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.360
a near future, that is, 2010-

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.960
2011, there will be problems.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.880
For manufacturing, that is, for

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.180
that require neocor will

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.660
happen a little later, but

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.420
it will definitely happen.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.520
Therefore, consider such a risk

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.620
as a decline in population.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.060
We will consider it not because we lack

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.420
the previous risk, the risk is

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.340
associated with the fact that the

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.240
capacity of the markets, when people

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.100
physically become twice as small,

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.540
and you, for example, focus

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.580
on your sales on 15-year-olds, no

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.920
matter what, textbooks, candy,

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.740
then the market, a priori,

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.640
should drop twice, because

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.180
the people will be less.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.580
Here we have looked at an example

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.460
of how to identify risks using pestley

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.740
and analysis.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.120
This is the most effective analysis,

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.700
revealing a lot of

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.860
strategic risks.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.180


00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.280
As for financial risks, they

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.740
are the same for every company.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.200
Therefore, consider another method

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.200
of identification of risks,

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.160
which allows you to identify

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.340
operational risks, as an example.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.260
Identification of risks by

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.780
business processes.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.320
The first risk is that the process

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.220
is either absent, or incorrectly

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.920
formalized, or is incorrectly

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.880
performed in its entirety.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.300
A very typical example is marketing.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.660
If you have a marketing

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.340
division structure, if you

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.280
have a marketing division board,

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.380
it doesn't mean you have

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.500
marketing.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.480
That is, it doesn't mean you really

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.860
know the market, you understand

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.820
what your competitors are winning

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.060
from, and you really understand

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.420
what products you need to develop.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.700
Another example is the management

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.000
of stock.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.780
Stock stocks are managed

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.860
by everyone, but a few, as a

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.200
consultant, I saw where it

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.800
was absent, the effect is

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.220
achieved within 3-4 months when

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.860
it was put in place.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.000
The next risk is the misuse

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.460
of information or its loss.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.500
Particularly pay attention to

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.780
the wrong movement to the order

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.560
of coordination in strategic

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.140
planning, in investment planning.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.740
Less consequences will be, but also will

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.760
be, if there are such problems

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.060
in the budgeting system, when

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.760
the starting data for calculating

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.500
different plans is a little different.

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.600
The next risk is the wrong performance

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.120
of the work.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.820
But this is already a lower level

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.060
of risk compared to the risk

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.960
of a lack of process and the

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.700
risk of a wrong allocation of powers.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.560
This risk is also very interesting

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.120
in terms of internal control, planning,

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.360
execution, including contract conclusion,

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.440
accounting and analysis

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.300
in one person.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.780
This potentially leads to

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.680
someone using the company'

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.360
s money or, roughly

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.640
speaking, to fraud.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:17.420
This example allows us to understand

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.100
how the risks are identified in the

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.820
process example.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.520
You can see, ideally, the process

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.780
should be painted.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.120
If it is really drawn, then the

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.840
usual camera analysis, when a

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.440
person sits in the office and analyzes

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.280
processes, most of the risks

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.020
will be identified.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.900
I will note something more.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.740
At our stage, for the formation of

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.520
risk maps, we do not need very

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.780
detailed lists of risks.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.060
The fact is that if you

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.240
look at the process as

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.400
well, you will see hundreds

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.460
of risks, no less, the

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.820
most diverse, from losing

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.200
the paper to some strategic

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.540
risks.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.560
For the audit, this description is very useful.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.460
For you as a top manager, it is not possible.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.040
If the process goes wrong,

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.960
combine all these small risks

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.600
into one major risk and try

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.820
to assess the consequences

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:25.140
of the whole process being wrong.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.240
Let us present a list of the risks

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.760
of the conditional mechanical plant.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.940
We identified strategic risks

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.800
with a slightly advanced

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.100
analysis.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.640
The financial risks are the same everywhere.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.040
Within the framework of our plant we will

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.060
consider currency, credit risk, risk

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.080
of loss of liquidity.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.820
What is the risk of loss of liquidity?

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.580
This is when we were borrowed,

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.900
borrowed and for some reason

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.980
we are not given money, or there

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.460
was some gap because we were waiting

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.940
for a large payment.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.860
Very interesting risk, very interesting

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.760
consequences.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.520
The consequences can range from breaking

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.980
relations with all major counterparties

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.200
to minimizing consequences.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.600
The point is that the risk can be significant,

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.560
so it needs to be managed.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.020
We are not considering interest

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:25.120
risk here, because it is unlikely

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.900
that medium-sized will take

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.660
loans attached to Libor

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:37.300
or Euro-Ibor.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.980
Consider the price slicers, when

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.580
the price of raw materials is rising

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.640
sharply, and we cannot transfer these

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.080
costs to the consumer.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.220
A very good example is agriculture

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.780
for companies that work

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.800
with large retail chains.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.320
Milk, for example, is seasonally

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.380
expensive, and it can be expensive

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.600
depending on the year twice, and

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.660
we have fixed prices for supply.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.320
So either we are forced to

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.640
stop the supply, but this means

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.000
a break, the development of

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.920
all the relations with this network,

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.200
or we are forced to trade for

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.020
a while to lose.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.180
Of course, the risk of tax

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.780
claim, and in Russia this risk

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.560
is very specific because even

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.460
if you are very good in accounting,

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.200
you have very strong methodologies,

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.280
you have decent accountants,

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.340
the risk still persists.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.840


00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.160
Not so much money losses arise, as

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.040
you are exposed to a large risk,

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.320
no matter what, even a little

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.640
bit of imagination in the scale

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.520
of the enterprise's revenue,

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.240
the counterparties begin to

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.380
treat you very curiously.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.600
In the case of our small

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.920
plant we will not calculate image

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.020
losses, we will simply calculate

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.000
based on a specific scheme

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.220
of financial and

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.180
economic activity,

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.240
otherwise it is also called

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.100
aggressive tax optimization,

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.540
how much can be

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.840
assigned to us.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.860
The same risk that I attribute to

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.120
the financial is the risk of increasing

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.960
the cost of construction, that is,

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.080
the same price jump, that is, the

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.500
same jump in the price of raw materials

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.340
for services, leads to the

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.400
fact that business plans are

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.420
also broken.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.580
The next type of risk is operational

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.560
risk, as already shown, is

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.200
identified mainly in the analysis

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:52.040
of the management system.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.800
The first risk, let's say that this

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.100
is the inefficiency of our

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.980
marketing company, yes, of course,

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.120
50% of the marketing costs

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.500
are usually superfluous, yes, and

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.100
the problem is that we don't know

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:06.220
what 50% but here the marketing costs

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.400
are not very large, say, 100

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.380
million rubles, but here we have

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.620
all the reasons to believe

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:14.200
that about half of these costs

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.040
are superfluous, yes.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.280
We will not blame marketers

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.460
for this, but we will

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.720
simply say that 50% is

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.720
used inefficiently.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.500
The next point also arises due to

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.660
the analysis of processes.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.660
The key in sales is to

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.880
provide discounts.

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.540
We have seen that discounts

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.880
are not given very transparently,

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.660
so we can say that we do

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.680
not receive some sort of revenue

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.400
from sales, we also announce

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.480
that risk.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.140
Furthermore, the risk associated

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.060
with the management of commodity

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.880
inventories, we, of course, even have

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.540
a little, but there is a suspicion

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.740
that we may grow unliquid, we also

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.420
declare this a risk.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.080
The inefficiency

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.320
of research and development

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.920
works, it is such, it is inefficiency,

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.560
very traditional for Russia, unfortunately,

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.000
many units, especially at

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.140
factories, do not perform their

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.620
function, something they are, of

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.340
course, engaged in, something

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.960
can be very necessary, but as

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.400
it usually happens, either invent

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.280
a bike, or can not bring to

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.960
a logical completion,

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.320
that is, before introduction

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.420
into production.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.420
Another risk is the excess of

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.200
staff, remember that the urban enterprises,

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.820
if we put a new line, then the new

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.720
line of import production, as a

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.440
rule, replace the whole workshop,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.500
and it may be that 300-500 people

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.420
in us will be superfluous, to

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.240
drive them out on the street,

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.460
in general, it is not possible,

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.160
it will be wrong.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.580
Well, again, including from the point

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.000
of view that it will be necessary to strengthen

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.020
the protection of both the factory and

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.060
top managers, because the enterprise

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.380
is small, everyone knows each

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.760
other.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.860
The growth in the cost of social

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:08.320
content, we have identified in the gun analysis.

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.080
Leaving top managers is a very

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.720
traditional risk.

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.560
Pay attention to who

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.340
your sales are locked for.

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.360
If all sales are locked only

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.740
one person, his care, and care can

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.660
be very different, may the competitor's

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.620
leave, maybe just the individual

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.560
is tired, maybe something happened

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.420
to the family, no matter what,

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.880
it may prove that such care will

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.360
simply lead to failure in

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.860
the implementation of

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.580
the business plan at least.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.360
That is, business strategically will

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.160
not suffer, but problems on the

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.040
horizon of six months to years we

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:48.760
have a huge number.

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.820
We also include this risk.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:55.320
Risk associated with the implementation of projects.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.280
Well, let's be, there are projects

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.420
in every company.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.020
Projects can be very different, for

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:05.340
example, a project to implement

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:07.120
information systems, a project

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.220
to build a new production, a

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.520
project, after all, to reorganize.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.360
Each of these projects we will

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.400
look at below in which decisions

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.960
what risks may be, can

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.680
potentially lead to some risks.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.060
Well, let's consider the specific

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.720
risk for this enterprise, because

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.060
its shares are listed on the stock

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.860
exchange, that is, the probability

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.560
that, say, the free fleet is

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.520
large enough that someone will

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:40.240
buy, will become a large mining

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.180
shareholder, that is, possessing

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.300
a block package.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.580
The problems, you understand, if it is

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:51.200
an oligarch, then the problems for business

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.200
are ensured.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.040
In terms of danger, the risks are quite standard.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.900
Fire at the main production, power

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.460
outages, loss of information systems

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.080
data, in addition to the traditional

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.140
consider the specific risk

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.280
associated with the breakdown

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.840
of the main water supply pipes.

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.340
Suppose that such a pipe passes through

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.740
the territory of our plant, it

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:18.280
breaks there once every 10 years,

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.320
it floods the main workshops,

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.140
and nothing can be done about this,

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:26.980
because the infrastructure,

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.740
its property is unclear, what

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.600
happens too, to whom it belongs,

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.020
whether it is a factory or

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.080
a city.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.200
In general, repairing it is useless,

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.700
once every 10 years is not so

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.420
often, but the risk of such there is.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.640
The next risk, please note, is inherent

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:48.300
in many, when a key supplier,

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.920
at least for reasons of hazard

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.680
risks, fire at the main

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.120
production, will not be able

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.020
to fulfill its obligations.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.800
There is a supplier, all of

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.460
you are satisfied, and it delivers

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.820
in the cost structure of 20-25%, you

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.200
can not replace it quickly with anyone,

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.100
and any of its problems will affect

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.780
your business in this way.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.980
At the same time, like us, he is

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.660
relative, that is, there are other

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.680
manufacturers, but something worth

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.200
it can only be purchased from him.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.620
Penal sanctions are also such

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:26.320
a traditional risk, not under

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.260
contracts, penal sanctions by third

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.540
parties, too, can be very different,

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:34.140
and the risks associated with

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.320
internal control, are the outbursts

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.940
in commercial activities,

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.560
it is theft.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.600
In terms of internal control, between

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.520
these two operational

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.280
risks and hazard risks, it

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.460
is often difficult to distribute

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.620
the risk.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.140
Well, for example, we see that we bought

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.160
something at a price of 10% more expensive,

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.080
the risk of danger is a malicious intent,

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.080
but the malicious intent is generally something

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.500
that needs to be proven, so it is probably

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.900
impossible to attribute this risk

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:13.660
to the risk of danger, but nevertheless,

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.560
this risk actually arises from the

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.700
process.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.140
However, we refer to it simply

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:19.480
because it is so easier

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.700
to show that such dangers exist.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.520
Well, the last risk to consider

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.920
for each of the is the

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.360
risk of unfriendly

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.460
acquisition.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.480
In the case of our plant,

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.540
say, they are interested

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.260
in some large corporation,

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.380
we mean a state corporation,

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.400
and in the near future this

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.960
risk can be realized.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.180
From the identification, what can I say?

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.660
First, pay attention to the

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:54.960
amount of risk.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.280
They, on the one hand, should not

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.460
be very few, that is, if you see only

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.780
10 risks, then you obviously did

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.940
not notice something, on the other

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:06.260
hand, there should not be a lot of them.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.880
If you have two hundred, then

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.400
obviously some of them can be enhanced.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.820
They are either the same by

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.860
nature or by effects.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.160
This is a small art of risk management,

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.500
that is, there should be

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.660
no much risk.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.460
Often it may be that the same

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.400
reason leads to both

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.080
strategic and operational losses.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.860
Let's say with the staff,

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.960
we may lack strategically staff,

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.380
this is the bigger way, and

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.080
in the operational activities

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.640
of personnel may also be

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.620
lacking.

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:51.560
It's not something terrible, either

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.740
consider one or consider

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.980
the other, how important it is to you.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:58.100
And finally, what should be noted?

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.160
Consider the risks according

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.080
to the scale of your business.

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:07.020
The fact is that a small

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.040
business, unlike a large,

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.360
can only manage very

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.560
small risks.

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.720
For a large business, considering

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.200
the risks are small, it simply

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.660
does not need to.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.980
Let me explain by example trade.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.460
If you have two bars, then the risk

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.400
of joining the WTO you can, of

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.080
course, consider, but, in general,

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.180
it is probably not your risk.

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.560
On the other hand, if you have a

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:39.760
large business, then fires, then

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.240
theft in these trading facilities for

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.200
you are more than real, moreover, it

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:49.420
is your life, and they will be a hundred

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:50.260
percent.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.720
In this case, you need to change the risk

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.260
from theft to the risk of increasing theft,

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.940
that is, you have a certain level, and

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:04.000
for you there is a risk that this

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.200
level will be significantly exceeded.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.320
The same with other risks.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:13.900
For strategic risks, a large company

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.400
should fear global competitors,

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.900
a small company should fear,

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.680
probably, also global competitors,

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.080
but on its territory.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.320
That is, if it is next to his lark

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.480
that a competitor will put.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.320
This is art, so when you are

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.140
performing a task for your business,

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.720
consider this, please, because

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.340
if the business is not very

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.860
big, then strategic risks you

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.300
can not manage in any

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.780
way, but at the same time

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.360
it does not mean that the

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.400
activity needs to be stopped.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.540
Yes, indeed, there are

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.760
a few strategic risks that will

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.360
lose the business entirely,

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.860
but to live in entrepreneurship

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.520
is also a risk.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.860
We have identified risks, that is, we

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.980
have identified them, but for further

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.240
effective work on the establishment

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.220
of risk management systems they

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.560
need to be described in some way.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.720
The purpose of this description

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.920
is to provide a structured representation of

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.960
all identified risks.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.680
Example of a standard firm.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.580
The table is quite large,

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:30.160
I honestly don't like to fill it.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.000
What does it contain?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.940
It contains the name of risk, that

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.900
is what was above.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.520
The risk area is a detailed description

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.620
of what is happening, what consequences

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.840
will be if events are

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.140
implemented.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:52.160
The nature of risk is the type of

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.760
risk, i.e. strategic, financial,

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.660
operational, or risk of dangers.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.500
The interested party is the one who is

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.480
affected by the risk.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.720
Note that the interested party

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.860
is not necessarily suppliers,

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.300
staff, it can also be the

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.600
public, it can be all kinds

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.140
of ecology, in bad cases

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.580
- the prosecutor.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.400
The quantitative definition of risk

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.060
will be considered a little later.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.840
Ideally, there should be a calculation

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.480
of the probability of damage, but it is permitted

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.840
for decision making, simply to

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.660
say, it is meaningful to us, or not

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.040
very significant.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.500
Acceptable risk, acceptable

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.600
risk is the same.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.840
Risk management mechanisms

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.480
are existing so-called

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.580
primary mechanisms.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.720
What is already in place

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.220
to minimize possible losses?

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.320
For example, the risk of personnel,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.800
the risk of staff, the risk

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.040
of staff shortage.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.600
We already have some programs there,

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.480
probably recruitment of personnel,

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.580
selection of retention programs

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.520
– this is what is already there.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240
Possible improvement

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.620
mechanisms and what can be improved.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.760
And developing a company policy

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.560
strategy is actually who should

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.860
be responsible for this risk.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.400
Here is a table.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.440
The more detailed it is, the better.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.200
You can not fill it, I recommend

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.220
another form at the end.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.740
In general, the most difficult part

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:31.660
– the identification of risks – is over.

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.160
What have we learned?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.720
The four types of risk analysis methods

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.800
are enough to apply them most

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.420
likely all together.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.900
Analysis methods are based on the analysis

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.040
of business in the internal external

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.380
environment and organizational methods,

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.600
i.e. the interaction of employees

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.600
in identifying risks.

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.220
For hazard risks, risk assessment of

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.940
large production facilities there

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.760
is a special set of methods.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.040
I will not read this video in this

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.960
course, watch the method.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.560
There should be not a lot of risks,

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.200
there is no clear value of the recommended,

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.920
but if they are less, again, 50-15-

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.780
20, you have not noticed something,

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.380
if more than 100, then they are most

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.680
likely advisable to amplify,

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.520
and in order to be able to apply

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.660
further risk management,

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.260
that is, to full efficiency, the

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.100
risks should be described as

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.620
detailed as possible.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.820
The example of description, again, is

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.760
a method, there is a short example.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:54.480
If you describe the risk

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.920
on half pages, the worse it will not

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.280
actually be, because the more detailed

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.880
the risk is, the easier it is to form

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.980
action programs.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.640
After the risk is identified, the

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.160
risk must be calculated.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.220
Risk calculation is of three types.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.220
There is a calculation of

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.780
risks quantitative, when the probability

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.060
is calculated in a specific value

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.920
of the percentage, and the damage

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.580
or other consequences are brought

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.160
to the monetary amount.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.100
It is semi-quantitative when we

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.640
indicate certain intervals.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.020
For example, the damage is from

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.340
10 to 100 million rubles, that

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.800
is, from 0 to 10, from 10 to 100 and

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.000
from 100 and above.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.320
And it is quite qualitative when

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.160
we operate the concepts of high,

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.060
large, medium, small, than

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.440
the difference.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.420
In principle, both are risk management,

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.660
but the problem with a purely

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.240
qualitative approach is that it

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.840
is very uncomfortable to appeal.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.520
A lot is how much.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.300
Once you get to the number 5 million, 10

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.760
million, 100 million, it will be easier

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.240
to communicate with everyone.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.500
That is, we understand that the probability

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.360
of our damage is high, that is,

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.700
in percentage of damage.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.960
The quantitative approach is a little better.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.200
Moreover, we will continue

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.940
to use expectation mat and in it

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.700
too can somehow estimate expectation

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.500
mat.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.840
But still, always aim to quantify

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.100
the risks, trying to show

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.960
that it is not very

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.760
difficult.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.100
Calculation of consequences.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.920
There are three levels: high,

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.700
medium and low.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.180
High is a significant

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.760
impact on the company'

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.280
s strategy or operations.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.280
What is the significant impact on the

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.060
strategy?

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.620
This will require some additional

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.020
capital.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:04.840
That is, the company risks something

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.160
more than the current profit.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.620
Average is a moderate

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.620
impact on the strategy when we

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.700
lose money, but not so much

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.640
and the strategy is likely

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.760
not to be changed.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.860
That is, we will still be able to

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:23.260
develop, we will still be able to

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.900
bring new products to the market.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.240
As a rule, the average level is a significantly

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.220
not very large percentage

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.640
of the profit.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.760
Well, low is when the value of the

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.700
financial impact on the company.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.380
Money is a pity, but not

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:43.080
critical.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.900
Now, we go to the probability calculation.

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.500
The most difficult here.

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.220
The fact is that if the damage

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.880
can be tasted, it can eventually

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.040
be counted as the cost

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.480
structure of events.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.300
That is, to count fuel and energy,

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.020
costs, wages, charges, raw

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.500
materials, materials, that

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.260
is, we will lose.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.360
It is probably the most difficult.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.960
So try to pay special attention

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.560
to these subsequent

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.760
slides.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.200
How is the probability of a negative

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.800
risk assessed?

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.340
Conditionally speaking, the probability

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.440
is considered high if an event is

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.140
possible several times over a certain

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.020
period, for example, 10 years.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.740
This corresponds to a probability of more

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.760
than 25%.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.880
Between 2 and 25 percent,

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.080
the probability is more than

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.680
once over a period of time.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.020
That is, once 3, 4, 5 years the event

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.600
can happen, but this means the probability

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.500
is less than 25%, and less than 2% the

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.760
probability is considered low.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.600
To simplify, for negative

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.780
events, what can be done?

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.020
In general, there is such a thing as

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.100
a reserve, say, in the reporting.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.320
If you know that events happen

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.600
every 5 years, it means that

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.040
you need to form a reserve in

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.040
the amount of the cost of the event

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.580
and annually form one-fifth of

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.500
the reserve needed to repay

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.000
the risk.

01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.980
Here such a simple interpretation

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:38.500
will allow enough quickly

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.660
for any risk to any user, any

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.640
person who applies risk management,

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.080
who tries to calculate

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.320
risk and assess.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.180
That is, if this happens

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.800
once every 3 years, then the

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.540
probability can be defined as 33%.

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.920
In fact, for strategic

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.600
risks, it is about the

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.000
same.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.180
If we know that we can have

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.220
a big competitor in 3-5 years,

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.300
then we can prepare for it.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.140
Again, somehow understand

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.560
how much money we will need

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.660
to fight this competitor

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.940
for 3-5 years to form

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.940
the necessary reserves.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.880
Calculating probability is the most

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.440
difficult moment to understand.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.780
In fact, it is quite simple in

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.440
terms of immediate action, but

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.500
it is a bit more difficult to

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.320
understand.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.900
Because the calculation of damage is understandable,

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.040
in the end, you can calculate the

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.360
direct costs of elimination.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.100
How much money will be needed,

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.020
it is easy to get it out.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.140
There are certain difficulties

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.440
in the probability.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.820
What does the company standard recommend?

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.000
He recommends three probability

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.620
values, namely high, medium

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.820
and low.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.440
High probability is when

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.000
an event can occur several

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.620
times over a period

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.440
of time.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.580
The time interval is recommended

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:18.080
to take ten years.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:22.380
If you have 3-4 times in 10 years

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.660
something can happen, then the probability

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.600
is high and corresponds

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.520
to more than 25%.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.840
If you can have it 1-2 times in 10

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.440
years, then the probability

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.220
should be assigned from 2 to

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.000
25.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:44.180
If the event is rare, in the recent past,

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.640
it has not been, then the probability

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.760
should be estimated less than

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.220
2%.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.640
A simpler option to

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.240
understand is based on

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.720
some reserve of funds.

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.720
If you know that you have an event

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.860
that happens once every 3-4-5 years,

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.340
then it means that every year

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.440
you need to reserve one, third,

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.220
fourth, fifth of the value.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.300
If we decide to hold the risk so that

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.460
it does not become unexpected

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.000
for us to cover it, then the probability

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.260
can be estimated in just 5 years,

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.640
it is 20%.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:25.880
Why is?

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.860
Because you can hold 20%

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:28.540
of the cost.

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:32.720
This understanding may not be quite

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.940
consistent with the ideology of risk

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.860
management, but it is easier for ordinary

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:41.640
people to understand it.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.760
In terms of positive risks, a slightly different

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.060
scale.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.720
The probability of a positive risk is

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.120
considered to be high if there is

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.880
a favorable outcome during the year,

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.360
that is, a value of more than

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.920
75% is assigned.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.160
A low risk probability is unlikely

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.180
to be achieved, and we can use it

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.260
when the probability is less

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.640
than 25%.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.580
In the meantime, this is the average

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.220
probability, that is, it is possible.

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.860
Some modification of probability for

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:25.220
calculations, less than 2%, from 2

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.440
to 25% for negative risks, this isined.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.000
The standard is modified in some way.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.140
Modified as?

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.920
There is a sum of events, positive

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.420
and negative, the probability of

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:41.940
the sum of events will be one, since

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.760
a positive event, low probability,

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.060
is less than 25%, that is, it is

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.680
unlikely it will happen within

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.720
a year, then for a negative event

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.660
we can immediately say that the

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.700
probability of more than 75% is that

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.040
it will happen within a year.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.980
Here is a small modification, another

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.980
point for the calculation of

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:05.240
probability, which will allow you

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.260
to quickly learn to count these probability.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.980
A special note for manufacturers

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.820
who are familiar with the declaration

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:16.280
on industrial safety

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.460
and the existing methods

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.220
of GOR Technadzor, there

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.940
is a probability is not

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.880
considered quite true.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:30.420
In ideology, methods are considered

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.480
correct, in ideology, risk management,

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.000
in the ideology of the firm is considered

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.140
not quite correct.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.840
Because 10-2 is considered to be

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.140
a risk quite common.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.320
10-2 as we know is the easiest

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.820
to imagine in just 100 years.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.880
In general, from what I saw in the

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.780
declaration on industrial security,

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.220
once every 100 years, no event

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.300
occurs, it occurs much

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.540
more often.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.200
And when I see that for the most

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.580
likely event, which actually

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.760
occurs almost quarterly, the

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.240
probability estimate of 10-2

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.340
is clearly wrong.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.240
Moreover, when we want to

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.060
reserve, many such events

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:17.960
need to simply reserve,

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.600
funds to eliminate them, such

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.100
a calculation will not allow

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.060
us to do so.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.720
All about calculation, all about

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.640
standard.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.520
There are two principles of risk

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.480
calculation.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.260
How can they be counted.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.540
This is an expert, even

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.340
more detailed,

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.720
expert-analysis and statistical

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.500
method.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.560
What is a good expert method?

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:52.160
The expert method is good in its simplicity.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.940
That is, you can very quickly sit in

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:59.500
a circle and estimate the probability

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.200
of absolutely each of the above risks

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:07.500
from 2 to 95% very quickly.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.440
The damage is also estimated

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.480
quite quickly.

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:17.240
However, in the expert method there is a

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.520
chance to get a not very correct assessment

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.500
because of what.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.380
Because of the composition of the expert

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.780
group, in the end I will tell you that many

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:29.880
experts, especially from business, tend

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.700
to underestimate their risks.

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:37.600
The second is the composition of the

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.920
expert group, that is, the people you

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.860
attracted.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.460
It may be that people are not really

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:47.660
highly qualified and do not understand

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.640
the processes themselves.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.000
In this case, it turns out that in general,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.660
the estimate on the principle of

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.060
the half-finger ceiling, it is probably not

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.200
very necessary.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.800
In statistical methods, there is

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.700
another problem.

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.960
If there is statistics, it should

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960
always be used.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.360
The problem is that statistics may

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.840
not be available.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.820
First, it may not take into account

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.700
the changes that have occurred.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.980
For example, we have statistics

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.000
on small theft.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.420
And here we look at it as if it

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.320
should not grow.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.940
But in fact there are some enters,

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.860
like there has changed that a hole

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:33.120
in the fence appeared, and theft

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.500
will actually grow great.

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.780
It is not always possible to evaluate

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:37.940
statistics.

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.720
Statistical methods where they

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.460
work very well?

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.820
They work very well in banks when evaluating

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.460
scoring systems.

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.560
It works well wherever there

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:48.940
is a lot of information.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.100
I, honestly, in industrial enterprises

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:56.300
never are effective,

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.540
especially in terms of the

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.840
effective application of

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.400
a complex mathematical

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.960
apparatus.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.820
But I must say that they

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.440
exist.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.060
If necessary, they can be used.

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.440
When there is a huge amount of

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.080
information, well, for example, banks,

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.640
the estimate of a particular borrower,

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.960
when the number of loans is 10,

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.520
000, it is a good statistic, and we can

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.920
apply different scoring systems there.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.060
It can be used in

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.380
industry, in commerce.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.340
To be honest, I have never seen

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.340
such a successful application, let'

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.980
s say, of what can't be done by

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.580
simple analytics without the application

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:43.180
of mathematics.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.240
In summing up the section on the calculation

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.260
of risks, there are three types of

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.660
risk assessment, that is, qualitative,

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:55.540
semi-qualitative and quantitative.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.260
The best quantity.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.300
How to estimate the damage is

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.580
quite simple.

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.080
In terms of the probability

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.100
calculation, showed some example, that

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.480
is, to estimate, I think you can.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.360
There are two methods of risk

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.280
calculation, expert and statistical.

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.420
Statistics are better, but

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.320
statistics are not always enough,

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.600
so the expert method is very

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.520
often used.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.080
It should be applied

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.660
with caution, and applied with

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.780
caution it will show

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.140
a fairly good result.

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:34.280
Now back to our conditional

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.240
mechanical plant.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.840
The complete method of calculation of damage is

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.900
in a separate column in the method.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.520
Here, I would point out that both expert

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.580
methods and statistical methods were used.

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.120
What types of risk methods

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.360
are used?

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.280
First, for strategic, it is easier

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.020
to estimate through the

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.660
fall in business value.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.300
Since the company is public,

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.460
we have some business value,

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.600
we can say.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.200
That's why, if you remember, I said

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.260
that for a public company,

01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.720
it's a little easier to calculate

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.600
the risk because we know that

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.420
one thing or another can lead to that.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.840
For example, a conflict with

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.280
the governor, the appearance of a major

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.860
player on the market will most likely

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.300
reduce our capitalization.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.980
However, the expert method can

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.400
also be used in combination

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.960
with the statistical, that

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.540
is, for example, for the risk

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.460
of outbound we know some cash

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.360
flow, we use some analytics on

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.100
catch-do-catch and determine, going

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.760
from internal control, as a percentage

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.800
of the cash flow that someone

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.940
can sit on so that we

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.960
do not notice.

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.620


01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:55.280
Such examples, expert,

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:58.160
analytical, are enough.

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.840
We always identify a stream and

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.040
estimate how much we can lose.

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.660
Statistics is not just about

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:11.580
accidents.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.240
There is a situation where a fire plant

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.160
occurs once every 10 years.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.400
Or once every 2-3 years there

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.320
is a power outage for one and

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.140
a half days, because we still

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.500
have a village of urban type.

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:33.580
Therefore, statistical methods are

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.760
usually used for hazard risks,

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.820
in the case of industrial

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.400
accidents.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.800
However, the statistical method may

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.320
also be applied to other types

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.520
of risks, such as operational risk.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.860
The risk of providing excessive

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.540
discounts with sufficient analysis

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.440
is very clear, where discounts

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.500
could not be given.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.500
It can also be estimated as a percentage

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.040
of any flow.

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:06.240
Or as a third of the amount of discounts.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.740
Per the risk is statistical outside of the

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.740
field, 10 products have recently

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.000
been developed, 5 have passed into a

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.920
series, 2 have been successful.

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:20.060
In general, I will repeat again that

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.480
the statistical methods are ideally

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.720
better, but most often, especially

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.540
if the task is to form the first

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.620
risk map, it is worth the task

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.460
to show enough and expert.

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:36.040
The risk is important

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.260
to be quantified.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.900
You see, both expert methods

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.920
and statistical methods can be

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.800
used to calculate different risks.

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.720
Again, I will emphasize, statistically

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:54.420
better, but in the first stage,

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.960
when forming the first risk

01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.960
map, you will most

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.100
likely use only expert

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.220
ones first.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:00.720
Why is?

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.660
Because statistics can be

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:04.500
a long look, but experts

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.720
are not so bad, especially

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.880
for the first.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.840
The final point of diagnosing risks

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.880
after we have identified

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.240
and calculated them, they must

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.720
be assessed, that is, compared

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.040
to some acceptable value.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.540
To assess, I am still forced to

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.880
use such a concept as mathematical

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.400
expectation.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.620
For us, it is enough for now that

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.800
mathematical expectation is a

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.920
product of the probability of damage.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.800
Example is on the slide.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.840
A 40% probability means that within

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.380
10 years, 4 times or 1 time will

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:50.640
occur 2.5 code.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.620
To cover this risk at the expense

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.620
of our own reserves, we need

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:58.800
to reserve from 80 million

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.800
32 million rubles annually.

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.460
What is risk assessment?

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:06.020
Risk assessment is the comparison

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.880
of a calculated value of risk

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.840
with an acceptable value.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.460
First, we must determine what is

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.260
acceptable for us and what is unacceptable for us.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.400
Then we compare this calculation, matte

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.860
expectation, with acceptability.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.540
There are some problems here.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.740
The problem is that the risk acceptability

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:30.800
should be determined by

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.940
the Board of Directors.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.000
I may not have much experience,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.220
but I have never seen the Board

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.120
of Directors at a reasonable

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.860
time at the next meeting

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.680
say that we can accept such a risk.

01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.000
Per this is due to the fact that the

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.380
risk-making procedure is six

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.340
months and you just need to understand

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:58.040
what exactly the risk management

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.160
system gives and after the Board

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.400
of Directors realizes it will be

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.620
easy to say.

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:08.400
Therefore, at this stage, it is enough

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.400
to simply act in the traditional

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.220
way, to determine the acceptability

01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:18.160
of risk as a percentage of any amount.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.240
From what amount?

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.020
First, it is the value of net assets,

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:24.440
it may be the capitalization of the

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.560
business, it may be the net profit,

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.120
it may be the EBITDA, it may be

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.780
some kind of ordinary

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:38.800
numerical value.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.580
In the example you see, we have a

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.740
risk of 32 million rubles in monetary

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:48.980
valuation, the acceptability for

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.940
us as 5% of the value of net assets

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:53.100
is 40 million rubles, that

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.720
is, we consider the risk acceptable.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:02.080
Based on this method, we get a comparison

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.540
of each of the risks and move

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.840
to the most interesting

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.200
in risk management, to the formation

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.580
of risk maps.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.720
Here is an example of the simplest

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.940
card, that is, our 34 risks

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:23.240
are distributed within very

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.840
high, medium, small, small,

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:27.020
damage small, large.

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:31.140
In principle, it is enough, the line

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:32.780
of tolerance here is difficult to carry

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.240
out, but obviously in the upper right

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.000
corner the risks are significant for us.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.180
The map is better, it is quickly

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:42.160
built, no quantitative estimates

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.760
are needed, it can be formed

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.780
within an hour by expert method.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.040
The next map I want to present

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.420
is a map with a logarithmic

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.360
scale along the damage axis.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.820
The map is good because it looks the most

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:59.180
beautiful of all, but what is the problem?

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.500
The problem of perception.

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.220
At the same horizontal distances,

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:04.260
risks differ not twice as

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.760
it would seem, but in order.

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:08.080
If you look at, for example, the

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.100
difference between 19 and 16 risks and

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.980
the difference between 29

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.740
and 27 is not as much as it seems.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.460
And again, the line of tolerance about

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.400
what it is doesn't look very

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.380
beautiful.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.200
The most beautiful map is a map

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.640
based on quantitative

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.640
estimates and with linear

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.940
scales of probability and damage.

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.300
Here is the map.

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:37.080
You see, not all risks are accommodated.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.740
This is actually not something terrible.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.040
What is on the map?

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.340
Anything that lies above the

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:46.960
line of tolerance is significant risks

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.360
for us.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.440
That is, they are critical

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.080
risks for us, and we

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.620
must pay attention

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.680
to them and think what

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.140
to do.

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:59.800
There are acceptable risks.

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.940
The risk is below the tolerance line.

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:08.360
In fact, they also have to fight,

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.220
that is, to manage them.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.300
However, the Board of Directors

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:14.880
may not be concerned about

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:15.520
them.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.080
Well, the most interesting question

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:22.860
that arises when reading such

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:26.340
a risk map is why the line

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.100
of tolerance, how it is

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:31.220
formed, what it is.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.660
So, the line of tolerance, why is

01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.940
it in this form?

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.280
The probability multiplied by damage

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.720
is equal to a constant.

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.640
Accordingly, if we build the probability

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.760
function of damage, we get the probability

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.860
equal to the constant divided

01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.420
by damage, that is, the probability

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.800
is the unit of x of damage.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.320


01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.620
This hyperbol is actually

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:53.660
depicted here.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.120
Why are they two?

01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:01.240
Two of them, because, for example,

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:04.680
I decided to show both 5%

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:07.960
of capitalization in this case

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.880
and 10% of net profit.

01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:11.500
The point is net profit, the

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.920
fat red line is capitalization.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.840
What is a good risk card?

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.100
Well, first, when you form

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.280
it for absolutely everyone, both

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:24.400
owners and management, it will

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.460
be very interesting.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.780
I have never seen people show

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.580
no revival when presenting

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.500
such a map.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.940
The second moment.

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:40.500
What is good about this idea, reports

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.640
on risks and diagnosis of the enterprise,

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.840
the fact that literally on one page,

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.160
especially if you put the legend

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.320
right, you will see absolutely

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.800
all the risks.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.100
That is, if you describe it all

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.580
in words, how consultants

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.000
had such a genre, the diagnosis

01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:05.460
report could be about many

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.560
volumes.

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.080
In general, this risk map is a

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.920
good substitute for this whole report.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.760
Another very interesting feature of this card

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:22.060
is that you know the matter, and the

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.300
Board of Directors knows, and

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:24.340
the top management knows.

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.440
Therefore, the risks imposed

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.500
on the list are likely not to be.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.880
However, in the mutual arrangement

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:38.440
of these risks, it may be that the Board

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.860
of Directors and top management have

01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.560
not paid attention to what is threatening

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:44.020
the business in a good way.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.180
That is the value of this map.

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:51.640
Literally, such a page can completely

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.060
reverse the idea of

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.600
the future strategy, what

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.660
to do, the role of top

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:59.340
management, the tasks facing

01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.220
top management, the adoption

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.140
and decision of the Board

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.360
of Directors.

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:08.120
So, we have formed a risk map and together

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.820
with the description of risks we pass it on to

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.320
the Board of Directors.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.380
We are waiting for decisions about

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:19.400
what risks we take and what risks

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.280
we will try to minimise.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.980
As a result of the decision, and in

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.600
fact in life it is often not the

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.160
results of the decision, but

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.340
the results of the risk manager's

01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:35.940
work, there is a program of

01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:38.560
risk management activities.

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.840
Before we begin to consider

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.960
the risks of a conditional

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.320
mechanical plant, I will tell

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.660
you about the typical risk management

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:48.140
measures.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.300
The first type of action is to

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:54.080
avoid risk.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.460
When is it necessary?

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.140
If you have a business, for example, you

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.080
understand that the business is risky.

01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:02.920
The most traditional way, the

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.960
easiest way to get rid of it, is

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.960
to sell the business.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.660
Maybe it is selling an asset.

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.020
abandon the project.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.480
If you understand that the risks

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.220
of a project are very large,

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.580
then naturally you can abandon

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.660
the project and change the strategy

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:19.740
in some way.

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.780
A very typical example is the exit from the

01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:23.660
market.

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.160
That is, we, say, stop working

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:28.120
with individuals, or we,

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.220
on the contrary,

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:30.560
focus on working with

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.620
individuals and give up

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:33.920
corporate clients.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.840
The next type is the transfer of risk.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.080
This usually includes insurance.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.240
If you choose insurance, and you

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.980
naturally choose for a part of

01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:47.420
the risks, in particular, fires,

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:51.140
pay attention to the fact that you

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.860
need to insure not so much asset.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.580
It often happens that the value of an asset

01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.960
is not fundamental to us.

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.420
Interruption of activities is essential.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:02.760
Insurance against such loss, from the

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.140
fact that we will stand for 3 months

01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:08.820
or six months, is very important,

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.060
and this risk needs to be insured.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.000
The next type is hedging.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:19.700
Hedging is very important for such risks

01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.680
that are not dependent on stock

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.660
exchange prices, say, and a very

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.460
traditional way of transferring risk

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:29.880
is outsourcing.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.200
What is outsourcing?

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.340
You can build yourself, you can take

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.440
a construction company.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.420
Once you enter into a contract with a

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:41.040
construction company, and the contract

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.760
is competent, for breaking deadlines,

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.960
for that, for that, for that, these risks

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.500
do not interest you, and

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.500
let professional builders with them be managed.

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:50.640
The same with transportation.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.880
You can have your own transport

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.520
company, you can outsource it.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.120
Unfortunately, of course, the

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:59.040
service market is not very large,

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.160
but I think it will continue

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.720
to develop and more and more

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.520
activities can be transferred

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:07.200
to outsourcing, and thus take

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.340
on a significant amount of

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:10.760
risk and engage only in

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.180
the main activity.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.480
The next type of risk is risk

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.060
retention, well, for example, conscious

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.180
acceptance.

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:22.860
We know that we have 3, 5, 10 injuries

01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:26.580
every year in the production.

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:28.000
We will fight this, but

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.460
for now, the price

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.880
of human life is not very high.

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:34.600
In general, in fact, we accept it and

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.860
will simply pay the employees who

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.120
suffered according to the

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.200
collective agreement, because

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.200
such a serious management of

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.900
this risk, a serious reduction in

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.500
the possible current, if each employee

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:50.100
will consecrately observe the

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.880
official instructions.

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:54.480
In Russia, especially in large

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.300
companies, this is almost impossible.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.980
Another type of risk retention

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.300
is self-insurance, that is, this

01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:03.340
is what I have said several times

01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.560
today, it is we form a certain

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.380
reserve under some risk.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.520
That is, we know that it can

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.820
happen and plan some money

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:14.720
in advance to cover

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.140
such a risk.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.440
Well, the most interesting is a method

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.840
called “measuring the

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.420
effects of risk.”

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.720
There can be a lot of options here.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.200
This slide gives a few basic techniques,

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.120
in fact, there are quite a lot

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:33.900
of them, but let's go through.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.700
Efficient capital use is the definition

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.800
of capital needs and the most

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.120
rational use of the resources

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.040
allocated by the Board of

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.480
Directors to ensure

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.840
the greatest sustainability.

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.440
Well, for example, for hazards,

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.380
it is not necessary

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:54.400
to change all equipment

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.920
in terms of sustainable

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.740
operation of the enterprise.

01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:59.400
Usually, it is enough to replace the

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.460
energy equipment, and in general,

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:02.200
everything.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.140
That is, once we replace energy

01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:06.720
equipment, we will already become

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.360
much more sustainable.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.120
The perfection management system is

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.240
a change in structure, change

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.840
in processes, change in the end of

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.240
the system of internal control of

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.280
the installation.

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.840
A significant number of risks are also reduced.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:22.100
Pay attention to strategic

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:23.640
management and strategic

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.260
decision-making.

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:27.840
Change the sequence

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.920
of actions in strategic

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.300
decisions may greatly

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.880
reduce the risk of a strategic

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.860
decision being wrong.

01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.460
It is obvious that it is important

01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:44.740
not to lose speed, because speed

01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.200
is also important.

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.580
But if it is a decision made

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:49.800
by one person, it is likely to

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.640
be a significant risk.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.940
Property protection is a

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:59.180
typical activity.

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:01.960
There is no security, strengthen the security,

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.740
it is the easiest.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.440
More complex is the legal protection

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.220
of property interests, for example, the

01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:11.680
division of ownership of assets

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:14.280
and operational management,

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.120
that is, the construction of a legal

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.280
structure in Russia and the scheme

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.580
of financial and economic

01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:21.720
activities to it.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.000
It can significantly reduce many

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.460
risks, including non-friendly

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:27.560
absorption.

01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.520
A separate type of activity is the formation

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.720
of a plan of action in crisis situations,

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.840
which I will talk about

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.840
a little later.

01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:37.580
We are returning to

01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:40.900
our conditional mechanical plant,

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:44.900
as we plan to continue to function.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.980
We will not give up on projects,

01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:48.640
we will not sell business, so we will

01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:51.220
consider only three types - transfer,

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.280
retention and mitigation of consequences.

01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:58.060
Transfer of risks is the risk of dangers.

01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:00.080
The risk must be insured

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.500
not only from property

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:04.520
losses.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.420
And risk needs prices, you can apply

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:12.520
such a method, such a risk

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.780
management, as hedging.

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:16.360
A very good example in the

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.840
airline – fuel is constantly increasing,

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.420
at the time of recording at least.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.440
Companies that properly

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.580
hedge, conclude long-term

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.100
contracts, use all sorts

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.680
of tools, they remain

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.860
in much less loss than an

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:35.460
airline that buys fuel

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.480
every day.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.560
In terms of risk retention.

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.740
If you pay attention to the card,

01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.180
then usually hold risks, which

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.660
are not very large.

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.180
Examples of such risks are the arrival

01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.380
of foreign competitors.

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:54.860
Why is?

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.520
Because we assessed this risk, which

01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.380
seems to sound awful, but it turned

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:01.580
out they would come.

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.040
This often happens.

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:05.960
Because the market does not know,

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.940
the products are not very suitable for

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:09.700
our conditions.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.980
Especially because of the

01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:14.560
great complexity.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.940
So, yes, they will come, somewhere from

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.440
us bitten, but bitten, nothing terrible.

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.560
The population of Russia will continue

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.100
to decline.

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:27.460
We can somehow help, but what

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.740
is called not now, but a little

01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:32.040
later, so this risk will also

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:32.740
be held.

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:33.960
Loss of liquidity.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.600
There should be no losses, such as

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.680
not very large in the current calculation.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.960
Until the situation has changed, we

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.220
will simply be re-credited

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.820
at some point with a more expensive loan.

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:50.160
Nothing terrible.

01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.980
The excessive number of staff

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:53.540
can also do nothing.

01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:55.820
We will keep, we will pay.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.280
And separately, it would seem, the risks

01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.580
of danger are always feared.

01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.940
There are risks that are not feared.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:03.840
In our case, let it be this conditional

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.340
pipe that goes under the

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:06.380
factory.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.080
That is, yes, we will keep, yes, we

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.960
know that once every 10 years such

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.800
an accident occurs, but we can

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:15.080
do nothing especially, no one will

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.080
insure us for it.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.100
No one will take this risk.

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.540
Interesting measures to mitigate

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:24.140
the effects of risks.

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.460
Let's start with the management

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.580
system, such a very typical example.

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:33.360
If you remember, there was a risk

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.240
when we had ineffective marketing costs.

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.900
With careful analysis, it

01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:41.100
may be that the functions of

01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:44.640
marketing and sales are combined.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.220
Therefore, changing the structure,

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:51.860
for example, the separation of marketing

01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:53.380
and sales to separate the

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:54.460
marketing and sales division,

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.800
will most likely reduce

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.180
this risk a little.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.020
Because there will be

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.600
two top managers, and their interests

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:07.180
will somehow arise a conflict of interests.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:09.580
Establishment of internal control system.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.440
In terms of operational risks, we do

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.520
not suspect our sellers on the repayments.

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:16.180
Therefore, we believe that the process

01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.160
of granting discounts is

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.340
ineffective, but at the same time

01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:21.520
internal control will reduce some

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.260
risks of danger, in particular

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.040
theft, in particular, theft.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.060
In fact, if you look at the map,

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.320
the risk of outbreaks can be

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.460
quite significant.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.440
We have repeatedly found that

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.480
they can be managed well.

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.420
A separate control subsystem is

01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:49.080
a risk of improving such a subsystem.

01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:51.820
It also always happens that we

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.620
need to put in our case this

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.000
management of inventory.

01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:57.200
We are individual because

01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.940
we have many.

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:01.860
Just by elementary algorithms we

01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:04.980
entrust to him to manage our remains.

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:06.760
Develop a plan of action in

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.780
crisis situations.

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.660
What should this plan consist of?

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.780
The plan is the restoration of business,

01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:18.720
the restoration of assets,

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.740
the restoration of activities, the staff.

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:28.180
This is part of the plan for

01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.500
crisis situations.

01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.900
The most typical emergency

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.920
action plan you have met

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.960
with is a fire evacuation

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:38.020
plan.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.320
This is really the most typical example.

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.940
Disconnection of electricity.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.820
With the power outage is very interesting

01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:48.820
risk.

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:51.340
It would seem that it rarely happens.

01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:53.060
There are some manufacturing

01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:54.440
for which power outages

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.040
can have very significant

01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:05.960
consequences.

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:10.540
This is the risk that is not realized

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:14.300
because we have two lines.

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:16.140
But if you look at it, two lines

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:17.860
on the same support.

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.800
Belas is really supportive, I don't

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.680
know about Kamaz, but I think it can too.

01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:26.400
Until the support recovers, a few hours

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.160
will pass.

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.660
We go further, looking questioned from

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:34.060
one station, from one thesis.

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.380
The line between these theses will

01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:38.340
clearly not provide our needs,

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.320
and we will not be burdened

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.800
in the first place.

01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:46.200
At the same time, production is very dependent

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:49.620
on the availability of electricity, and the

01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:50.300
plan is not ready.

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:53.420
Simply forming such a plan, putting

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.860
the generator and providing electricity,

01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:00.460
you can greatly reduce the

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.960
term and not even spend

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.880
especially on insurance.

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:08.340
Unfriendly absorption is also a typical

01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.260
risk where a plan of action in

01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:12.160
crisis situations is needed.

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:16.700
We must be ready, we must

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:19.620
be ready from all sides.

01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:26.440
Publication even on advertising rights,

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.940
articles absolutely in the entire press.

01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.660
Letters to the prosecutor, letters to Moscow, letters

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.780
to the governor, letters to everyone.

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:38.420
Again, a reserve legal entity,

01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:40.440
because if the court for some

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.880
reason imposes a limitation

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.320
on the action of one lawyer,

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.240
we will have a reserve.

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:49.000
This crisis action plan is

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.800
applicable to a large type

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.540
of risk, for a large

01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:56.540
number of risks, including

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.900
market risks.

01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:01.520
For example, someone is doing a big

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:04.020
action, we also have to be prepared for it.

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:11.880
With this method, a large

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.340
number of risks can

01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.600
be managed.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:19.080
The more business, the easier

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.280
risk management.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.920
For big business, for big money,

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:25.120
absolutely all the risks,

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:30.160
strategic, legislative changes are available.

01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:33.840
If you have an influence on the State Duma,

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.960
I'm not talking about the president, then

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.040
this risk can be removed a priori.

01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:41.960
For competition, using administrative

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.160
resources you can minimize the effects

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.880
of competition in the markets

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.540
that are most interesting to

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:51.940
you, as there is nothing to do.

01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:56.360
The more business, the more detailed

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.520
the program should be, the more

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.240
efficient its work.

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.920
As an example, I will show

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.020
the changes in strategic risks

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:13.360
for our conditional mechanical plant.

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:16.760
An elementary program of

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.360
activities can place every risk

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.180
under the line of tolerance, with

01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.660
the exception of some.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:26.800
The 10th risk was, and will remain.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.900
This is the population, we can do

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:31.300
nothing, yes, big, but we will

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.160
live with it.

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.580
Absolutely all other risks

01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:36.640
are very well under

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.060
the line of tolerance.

01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:41.740
A very important point is that

01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:43.220
the risk management is

01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.340
necessary only if the cost

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:47.080
of the program itself

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.680
is small compared to the

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.160
change in risk.

01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.220
If you are risking 100 million

01:46:58.220 --> 01:46:59.880
rubles, in order to minimize

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.900
it, and only the risk

01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:04.620
value is 80, then this is

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:07.620
probably not appropriate.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.340
That is, the risk should be held if

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.180
it turns out that the cost of the

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.180
activities is very high.

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:17.040
Consider the conclusion of the risk

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.260
map of our conditional mechanical plant.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.360
You see that the event program allows

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.280
you to manage the vast majority

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.520
of risks, that is, the vast

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.860
majority of risks can be placed

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:31.560
under the line of tolerance.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:35.560
Well, or if not to place, it is at

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:37.360
least great to get close to it.

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:39.880
What usually happens?

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.260
If you calculate the expectations

01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:44.000
of all risks, then, naturally, calculate

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.180
wisely so that there are

01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:46.760
no intersecting risks.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.300
And comparing it to the residual risk,

01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:53.160
it will be that three, five, seven,

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.620
ten times such a decrease is more

01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:56.380
than possible.

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:01.140
But what should be noticed?

01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:03.640
Part of the risks you will not feel that

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.580
there has been a decrease.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.440
Do you feel what?

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.660
You will not feel the lost gain.

01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:14.300
You will feel very much all the

01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:19.660
risks associated with direct

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:22.260
damage that leads to direct damage

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.300
to the company not expressed through

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:28.160
capitalization, which fell by 25% in

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:30.260
market value, namely, which led

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.380
to a deterioration in financial

01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:34.500
outcome in the current period.

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:38.500
And again, such a cardboard website directors

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.020
will be very pleased.

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.460
I think that the implementation of

01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:46.720
the program of activities, if it really

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.340
works, the thing is that in the middle

01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:50.900
business it may never work, but,

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:54.020
nevertheless, it is necessary

01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:55.460
to try.

01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:57.780
If we can implement the program of actions,

01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:59.760
then, in fact, there will be

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.500
a long-term sustainable development.

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.500
Before I go to the last part,

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:11.280
I will give two forms of risk

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.000
reporting that I think are most

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.980
convenient.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.480
The first is a simple description, that is,

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.160
we do not make 9 charts, as the standard

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.920
recommends, but simply write everything

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:27.480
in one place in the description of risks.

01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:30.620
The second is to describe activities

01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:32.300
and compare their costs.

01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:38.140
With the change we see from this table

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.100
in the last column that if the change

01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:45.280
of risks is significantly greater than

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:47.460
the cost of measures, then it is necessary

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.980
to implement.

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:52.240
When forming the last

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.880
table, note that the same

01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:57.000
event can have a significant

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.380
impact on a large number

01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.540
of risks.

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.400
A very typical example

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.940
of an investment program or the

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:07.480
creation of a new product will affect

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:12.640
both the fall in revenue and the increased

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.460
competition, if we have a new product,

01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.940
we are easier to compete,

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:18.240
and the problems with personnel,

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.160
when the lack of qualified

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.680
personnel, and there needs

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.700
500 people.

01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:25.540
If you buy new equipment, then you

01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:27.420
will need 50, 50 to get easier than

01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:29.220
500 and so on.

01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:33.280
In this case, we look at the sum of the

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.640
risk expectation that will

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:37.240
be removed and compare it with that.

01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.660
The last thing that is needed to establish

01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:45.020
a risk management system is to

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.800
ensure monitoring.

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.760
What is Monitoring?

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.880
The aim is to monitor the results

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:53.600
of risk management.

01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:57.840
First, we control the program

01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.620
itself, how it is implemented,

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:02.700
the risk-holders, and not

01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.460
how they do something or just

01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:07.660
write reports.

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:11.680
What methods exist?

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.740
The method is to control the correctness

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:15.260
of the identification of the risk

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:17.800
calculation itself, their assessment,

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.320
as far as it is acceptable for

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:22.420
us, not acceptable, regular audit.

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.700
Since the process needs to be continuously

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:29.860
improved, it is a review of

01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:31.760
standards to identify

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.320
opportunities for improvement.

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:36.420
Before we move to the next section,

01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:40.360
where I will discuss the

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.780
use of risk management in

01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.600
key decisions, we will summarize

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.500
this section.

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.200
There are several types of risk cards.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:52.420
The most transparent and effective

01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:54.960
risk map, based on a quantified

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:57.300
estimate of calculation and effects,

01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:03.260
presented together with a description

01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:04.880
of the risks for the SSD.

01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:10.260
This is the most interesting point of risk management.

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:12.200
The SSD must then make a decision,

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:13.460
in fact it does not make

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:16.260
a decision, but takes the risk manager.

01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:18.220
The program of the event is being formed.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.740
There are four types of activities.

01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:23.760
This is the avoidance of risk, risk

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:25.980
transfer, risk retention and mitigation

01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:27.260
of risk consequences.

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.980
They are all applied.

01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.020
Which to apply?

01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:35.100
First, it depends on the size of the business.

01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.920
The larger the scale, the less

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.720
risk retention should be and the

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:41.240
greater the mitigation of consequences.

01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:46.380
It depends on the current business strategy.

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.600
Monitoring of the implementation

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:52.760
of the programmes

01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.420
is necessary.

01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.220
Monitoring is the control

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.260
of risk management results.

01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.720
In this section we also

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:03.840
discussed possible forms of risk reporting.

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.700


01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:06.740
The forms are much more convenient

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:08.280
than recommended by standards.

01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.960
They used to work on projects that

01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.400
people liked.

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.260
The next section is the use of

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:23.340
risk management in decision-making.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.300
What to Consider?

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.580
First, if you remember, the

01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.380
formation of a risk map is

01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:36.640
still more negative risks.

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:38.160
Positive risks also come

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:39.920
there as a lost profit.

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.740
But the basis is negative

01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:44.520
risks.

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.220
In decision-making, the Icussie

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.220
should be considered equally.

01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:50.600
What is the specificity

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.200
of risk management in decision-

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:53.060
making?

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.940
If you remember, the risk map

01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.900
we considered for non-positive

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.520
risks, that is, they were also like

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.980
a lost profit, but still negative.

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.200
When making decisions, you need

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.220
to consider both positive and

01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:11.600
negative risks, which is called, in

01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.740
equal measure.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:18.040
It will greatly simplify the situation if

01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:20.460
you, when making decisions, when evaluating

01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:22.380
any project, product, whatever, go

01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:26.140
not only to the calculation in money,

01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:30.940
but also to the estimation of the calculation

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.300
of risks in time.

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:41.420
That is, there is a project that

01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:43.940
can be delayed for various reasons.

01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:45.740
We will not lose money, but we

01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:46.760
will lose a lot in time.

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:48.620
In order not to transfer money at the

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:51.400
time, it is more convenient to assess

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.440
these parameters.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:54.210


01:54:54.210 --> 01:54:57.890
And then I talk about how the

01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:00.550
decision can change if you

01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:02.510
use Risk Management technology.

01:55:03.190 --> 01:55:04.990
Three products are

01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:08.070
initially considered.

01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:11.690
Money is enough to start just one.

01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:17.330
There are initial calculations for the project.

01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:20.330
The parameters of the projects can be

01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:21.090
very different.

01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:25.490
I have here for ease NPV and repayment

01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:26.350
period.

01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:28.410
In fact, you can also calculate the

01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:29.810
internal rate of return, well,

01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:30.910
whatever.

01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:33.110
The main thing is to count.

01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:37.110
You can not consider the repayment period.

01:55:37.590 --> 01:55:39.390
Then the calculations in time to

01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:40.830
convert into money.

01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:45.030
So, the number one product NPV has

01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:46.290
500 million rubles, the repayment

01:55:46.290 --> 01:55:47.350
period is two years.

01:55:47.590 --> 01:55:50.390
Number two product NPV billion, one

01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:51.550
year repayment period.

01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:53.770
And the product number three NPV 300

01:55:53.770 --> 01:55:55.930
million rubles, the repayment period of

01:55:55.930 --> 01:55:56.470
two years.

01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:59.710
It would seem quite obvious that

01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:02.450
product number two is the best.

01:56:03.170 --> 01:56:05.270
However, we calculate the risks.

01:56:05.410 --> 01:56:06.910
And what do we see?

01:56:07.090 --> 01:56:10.210
We see that the risk of the product

01:56:10.210 --> 01:56:13.850
alone we will lose about 100

01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:14.650
million rubles.

01:56:15.370 --> 01:56:17.410
For product number two, we will lose

01:56:17.410 --> 01:56:19.110
just a very large amount.

01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:21.770
Especially from the NPV of this product

01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:22.630
700 million rubles.

01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:25.050
I draw your attention to what often

01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:27.110
happens when calculating that the

01:56:27.110 --> 01:56:31.150
risks they NPV will make negative.

01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:33.230
The project is not paid off.

01:56:33.230 --> 01:56:34.370
It happens too.

01:56:35.170 --> 01:56:36.550
And you should not be afraid of this.

01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:38.170
It is real.

01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:40.190
If you go out in the process of calculating

01:56:40.190 --> 01:56:46.670
such a value from expectation, then

01:56:46.670 --> 01:56:47.330
that is normal.

01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:49.070
The product is 3.

01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:53.470
It turns out that we are unlikely to

01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:55.890
lose anything in the process, but we can still buy.

01:56:56.230 --> 01:56:57.510
It happens too.

01:56:57.630 --> 01:56:58.830
Do not be afraid of this.

01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:03.130
And in part the time turned out that

01:57:03.130 --> 01:57:04.490
one project will last for a year,

01:57:04.770 --> 01:57:07.030
the other for two and a half years, and

01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:09.230
the third half a year to drink.

01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:11.450
Again, two and a half years is more

01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:12.530
than a real time to delay

01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:14.490
the project, especially if you are

01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:16.070
working in construction.

01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:22.320
What happened in view of the risks?

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:24.260
With the risks in mind, the priorities

01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:26.340
have changed.

01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:29.760
The second product that seemed

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.380
to us before we considered the risks

01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:33.940
associated with this project the

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.340
best, it is actually most likely,

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.640
if not worse, not superior

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:45.340
to other products.

01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:47.440
Therefore, most likely, based on these

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:49.580
risks, we need to get involved in the development

01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:51.200
of product number three.

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.340
Edmina this technology, if you

01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:55.740
remember the third example from the introduction,

01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:00.080
allows you to take into account all

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:01.440
risks, either to abandon the

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.640
project in time, choose another, or

01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.100
at least minimize these risks.

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:09.140
Here, the risks taking into account

01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:12.980
the current situation can be added

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:14.780
to the graph, and what if we

01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:16.960
manage them qualitatively.

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:19.560
Using basic mathematical things

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.900
allows us to digitize everything

01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:26.960
that threatens us and really

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:29.560
make the most important decisions.

01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:33.000
What decisions should be made in

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:33.800
this way?

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.360
First, it is the development of a strategy.

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.560
When making strategic decisions,

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:44.880
you do not need to pay attention

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:46.780
only to the financial indicators

01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:49.760
that are laid down in the business plan.

01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:52.660
The risks can be much greater.

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:55.520
The next solution is to combine investments.

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.960
Purchase of equipment.

01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:00.060
Yes, there are cheaper equipment,

01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:02.020
but in operation it can

01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.360
be much more expensive.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.320
There are equipment like more

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:07.180
expensive, but in operation it is cheaper.

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:08.540
There is equipment that is easy

01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:10.080
to install and easily learned

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:10.960
by staff.

01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.240
There is equipment that works

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.720
only in the presence of adjusters,

01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:15.840
which need to be written

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.100
out from somewhere abroad, and

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.020
our employees will not

01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:21.080
be able to physically work on it.

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.600
All this needs to be taken into account.

01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:24.700
Construction is understandable.

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:29.340
Traditionally, a couple of years stand

01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:30.360
on original authorization

01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:32.520
documentation, more than familiar

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:33.980
to every person.

01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:35.960
When buying business.

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.520
It is obvious that there are

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:39.200
positive effects of synergy, especially

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.800
when you buy a business from the

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:42.360
same industry.

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:43.920
However, there can be such

01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:45.820
negative effects that this business

01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.980
is better not to buy and develop

01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:50.940
only your own.

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:53.620
More than real too.

01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.580
You can read any reviews on

01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:57.700
MND deals.

01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:01.000
There are many ineffective purchases.

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:02.900
The regional expansion.

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:04.460
It is necessary to understand when

02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:07.060
we go to the region, especially if

02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:09.600
the business existed within one

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:11.820
region such as Moscow, St. Petersburg

02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:14.320
or Nizhny Novgorod.

02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.740
He decided to go to other regions.

02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:18.760
What awaits us in these regions,

02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:21.780
what risks, to assess them.

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:25.880
It is not necessary to

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:28.900
give up on projects.

02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:31.340
It may just prove that these

02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:33.300
risks need to be managed.

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:35.400
The same with reorganization.

02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:40.480
Reorganization of any management.

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:43.060
Finally, assess how much the employee'

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:45.080
s departure will cost and how

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:46.160
you will deal with it.

02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:48.640
Many of the decisions.

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:52.620
I would like to stress again

02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:54.600
that we do not have to take risks

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:56.340
and say we will not go there.

02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:58.540
Business and business is

02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:00.960
risk.

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:02.260
The traditional phrase.

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.240
Who does not risk, does not drink champagne.

02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:09.740
But after considering the risks, having

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:11.800
calculated them, what will cost in

02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.660
time, in terms of time, in money, you

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:19.500
can already at the planning stage,

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:21.540
how strategies begin, ending a particular

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:23.340
project, learn what is waiting,

02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:25.340
respond in a timely manner.

02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:29.860
And then there will be no activity, as in

02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:31.780
the case number one.

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.820
When something happens all the time,

02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:35.880
we don't know where it

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.980
comes from, but money pays.

02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.860
And the conclusion.

02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.280
The organizational aspects.

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.340
Management of Risk.

02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:52.540
The standard clearly states what is

02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:54.260
required by the management.

02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:57.040
First, we need to support the implementation

02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:59.240
of a risk management system.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:02.980
If the business owner, the board

02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:05.980
of directors is not interested in

02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:08.240
implementing risk management, then

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:11.760
expecting that everything will go well

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.260
is likely impossible.

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.920
The next is the distribution of responsibilities

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:17.760
and responsibilities.

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.220
This is the individual

02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:28.280
who will perform the risk management

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.700
function.

02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:34.680
The next is resources.

02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:39.020
Often not training, resources are often

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.880
not investments, but resources are time.

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:46.960
That is, to distinguish employees

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.420
and say that risk management

02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:48.960
should be.

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:51.100
But again, the key is the first point.

02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:52.280
If the management of risk

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:55.080
management is not interested,

02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.720
then you will form a risk card.

02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:01.740
You will probably feel very well

02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:03.120
when you are talking about

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.640
the risk that I described

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.980
two and a half years ago,

02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.540
but it is unlikely that a

02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:11.140
risk management system will

02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:12.400
be put up as such.

02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:14.940
Partly organizational.

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:15.820
How to organize?

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:19.380
There are two key divisions in

02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:20.280
risk management.

02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:24.960
The risk manager and internal auditor.

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.220
Such a modern structure and location

02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:31.820
of the internal auditor is represented

02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:34.100
in this figure.

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:35.740
The internal auditor is subject to the

02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:37.800
audit committee of the website of the directors.

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:39.860
The risk management unit is subordinated

02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:41.420
to the Director-General.

02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.160
Possibly options.

02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:46.580
In the initial stages in Russia,

02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:48.640
it works quite well when the internal

02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:50.100
control and risk management

02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:51.240
unit is also in subordination

02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:54.280
to the service of the

02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.000
internal auditor.

02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:58.640
This, of course, is a violation

02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:00.420
of the independence of the auditor,

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:02.500
but in Russia it works, why not

02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:03.880
independence, can be ensured by

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.740
other methods.

02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:06.940
Please note that all

02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:08.500
other units are also

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:11.060
involved in the risk

02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:13.720
management system.

02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:15.100
This is really all

02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:16.800
units, the risk can

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.600
affect the owners.

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:20.700
In the end, the risk can be

02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:22.380
absolutely everyone.

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:24.640
The next thing we consider is the

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:27.120
organizational aspect of risk

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.460
management, how it is possible

02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:31.080
to implement the risk management

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.220
function in a real enterprise,

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:35.380
in real business.

02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.840
First, it is naturally visible

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.060
to a dedicated specialist

02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:40.860
or separate structural unit.

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.360
At the 5000th plant, of course, it

02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.220
is not difficult to find, to allocate

02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:50.860
a bet for a person.

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.500
It will probably be

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:55.300
enough for such a plant.

02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.660
But first, there are problems related

02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:00.940
to the fact that you do not want

02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:02.360
to expand the number.

02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:06.600
The second problem is that

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.920
not every specialist can

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:08.540
be found.

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.820
Therefore, the standard also recommends

02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:13.380
consulting with an

02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:16.580
external consultant or using

02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:18.060
existing internal control

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:19.280
units.

02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:23.160
What a good external consultant,

02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:25.500
a freelance consultant, is good is

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:28.700
that he is independent of nothing.

02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:32.500
I will continue to point out that

02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:34.900
there are two types of risks, but

02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:36.540
in fact, a freelance consultant

02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:38.580
does not represent any side, he is

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:43.440
not involved in intra-corporate currents.

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.400
The 5000th plant, as you

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:49.820
understand, may have a very

02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:51.100
curious atmosphere.

02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:54.620
What is not very effective an external consultant,

02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:59.640
is that he is not very interested in being

02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:03.100
responsible for the results of his work.

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:06.440
Second, if it changes often, then

02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:09.160
it may turn out that everyone

02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:11.900
will have to dive again.

02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:13.920
Not the legal person changes

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.340
often, but the natural person.

02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:17.620
That is, who performs the

02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:20.320
risk management procedures in the

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:22.620
company, he needs to get into it

02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:23.020
and so on.

02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:24.940
It does not always happen well.

02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:27.740
The most effective is

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:29.200
the internal control unit.

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:30.880
That is, the unit that

02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:34.300
makes changes to internal

02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:36.280
control, it is also

02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:37.880
well aware of all

02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:41.800
risks, can identify them.

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:43.740
He can manage them, recommend how

02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:45.400
to manage them.

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:46.160
The problem in what?

02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:48.100
The problem is the internal

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.040
control unit.

02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:50.580
It generally does not take

02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:52.740
into account such strategic risks.

02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.180
And as we know, they are the most important

02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:58.540
and when assessed they are the most significant,

02:06:58.540 --> 02:06:59.940
unlike all the others, which

02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:01.100
you can close your eyes to.

02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.420
What functions should be performed

02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:05.940
by the risk management unit, it does not

02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:08.040
matter how it will be organized there.

02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.640
First, develop a risk

02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:11.100
management strategy.

02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:14.180
The development must be approved by the Board of Directors.

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.660
Its only task to develop.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.080
Development of risk management

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.060
measures.

02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:25.420
That is, all that we did, but in application

02:07:25.420 --> 02:07:26.960
to a particular factory.

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:29.860
Preparation of reports and development

02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:31.720
and review of the risk management

02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:32.500
process itself.

02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:35.060
This is important because the situation

02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:36.440
is changing.

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.580
At least, the line of tolerance can clearly

02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:43.440
depend on the stage of business

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:45.080
development.

02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:47.200
In the end, an internal audit

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.420
should be done.

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:51.520
Of course, it is an audit

02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:54.360
to provide a guarantee of effectiveness.

02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:57.120
The Board of Directors is convinced that the

02:07:57.120 --> 02:07:59.020
process is actually going on.

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.440
Both the internal audit standards

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.200
and the risk management

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.920
standards prescribe that the

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:09.100
internal audit should actively

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.900
support, participate, train

02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:15.480
employees, promote risk

02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:17.740
management, promote risk

02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:19.880
identification, help assess

02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:21.660
if necessary.

02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:25.200
This depends on the development

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:26.100
of internal audit.

02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:28.700
Someone is barely leading

02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.140
this process, someone

02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:34.180
is on the side, refusing to consult.

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.400
But this is also acceptable in

02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:37.440
accordance with internal

02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:40.000
audit standards and risk

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.700
management standards.

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:46.420
The internal audit is also organizational

02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:48.280
in providing all the risks

02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.020
reports and reports on the

02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:53.040
implementation of the programmes

02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.900
of activities that are provided

02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:59.600
in the Board of Directors.

02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:02.920
I will summarize the results of this course.

02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:04.300
So what have we learned?

02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:06.500
We learned what is risk management,

02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:09.100
what is risk management, what

02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.760
are the standards of risk management.

02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:14.340
We looked at the company standard.

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:17.600
Within the framework of this standard,

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:19.160
they learned to identify

02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:21.140
risks, calculate them, form risk

02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:23.480
maps, and form risk management

02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:25.960
activities programs.

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.920
They also understand the units

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:33.300
that have to deal with risk management.

02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:35.280
There are not one, but two, including

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:36.820
an internal audit.

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.900
Note that management support

02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:42.600
is required for successful

02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.420
risk management.

02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:46.600
In fact, if there is no support,

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.200
then the risk map can still be formed

02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:50.380
as such a good exercise, but

02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:52.180
just further the map of

02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.280
the matter will not go.

02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:57.960
What do you want to pay attention to at the end?

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.560
First, there is a standard, but you,

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:07.680
if you come up with something, no

02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:09.760
problem if it goes out of the standard.

02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:11.660
The main thing is that it is convenient for

02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:14.320
you, the board of directors and

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.720
all the other participants in the

02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:17.320
process to understand.

02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:19.560
Risks are very interesting.

02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:22.720
The most interesting risks faced

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:26.500
by the tundra forest are that

02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:30.080
it is almost impossible to

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:30.900
build roads.

02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:33.920
There are such trees, a maximum of

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:37.020
4 meters high, which cannot be cut.

02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:40.020
It is a relic forest on the border

02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:42.800
of Komi and Ninin Autonomous

02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:44.340
District.

02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:46.880
It is possible to obtain permission, but

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.160
it is associated with very large difficulties

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:50.820
for the cutting of the forest.

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.300
Another specific risk is associated with the

02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:00.240
Fund for the Support of the Governor's Good Initiatives.

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.200
The risk is related to the fact

02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:03.700
that some that have faced

02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:04.680
in constitutional practice

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:06.640
refuse to contribute money.

02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:10.660
This is also a very specific risk.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.880
However, it can also be assessed

02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:16.720
and calculated primarily the

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:19.060
negative consequences it will

02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:19.940
lead to.

02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:22.900
The last such fun risk is related

02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:26.460
to the city of St. Petersburg.

02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:32.420
There are new factories, Toyota,

02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:34.200
other automobile companies.

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:38.540
Risk to existing.

02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:43.940
There were several companies where

02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:47.660
we participated as external consultants.

02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:50.000
The risk is that the best personnel

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.380
will be recalled to these new

02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.240
factories.

02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.960
Risk is very well managed.

02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:00.080
At the time of the recording of the

02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:01.480
lecture, no enterprise was injured,

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.000
but a car giant was injured.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.300
So, you should not be afraid of risks.

02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:08.320
The risks are very specific.

02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:09.940
Find out and invent.

02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:12.520
What else would you like to note?

02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:14.660
I would like to point out that there are two

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:15.580
types of risks.

02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:17.760
The first type of risk is when

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:18.980
an employee is interested

02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:20.380
in it.

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:21.840
That is, the employee of the enterprise

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:23.860
is interested in the fact that this

02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:26.320
risk was identified, brought, and even

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:29.480
desirably the money for it was received.

02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:33.100
These are all risks associated

02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:35.260
with increased competition,

02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:38.240
equipment, personnel, and so on.

02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:41.940
But at the same time there is a

02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:46.840
risk when the same consequences,

02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:48.400
but depends on the direct actions

02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.480
of employees.

02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:52.940
Of course, identifying such

02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:56.340
risks will not be interested in any employee.

02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:00.400
What to do in this case?

02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:01.580
First, try to organize

02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:04.000
two streams.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:06.100
Two streams, what is it?

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.020
For example, in the market.

02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:11.760
If there is a marketing department,

02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.740
of course, ask the marketing department,

02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:14.900
there is a market forecast.

02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:17.340
Try to find an independent study.

02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:19.920
If it is a production facility,

02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:21.860
try to independently assess the

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.420
condition of the

02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:24.640
production facility.

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:25.980
Because the same major accident

02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.300
is of course the easiest to

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:31.040
attribute to the ageing of technology,

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.380
but it can occur due to

02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:34.720
unskilled personnel, due to

02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:35.720
unskilled management,

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:38.340
because of the fact that equipment

02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:39.660
is just poorlyined in

02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:41.320
this state.

02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:45.920
As for the staff, try

02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:48.340
to organize two streams.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:50.520
Whether it is something we

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:51.880
have with the motivation system

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:54.700
is not that we pay, gently speaking,

02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:55.980
people are not as much as they

02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:57.140
are, yes, or we really have

02:13:57.140 --> 02:13:58.920
objective problems, as in

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:00.720
a town-type village, when people

02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:02.980
leave and find there a qualified

02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:04.740
employee, including a risk

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:05.880
manager is almost

02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.040
impossible.

02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:08.960
Here, using these two streams

02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:11.160
will allow you to understand the risks

02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.880
quite objectively.

02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:15.180
Use the principle that the internal

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:19.760
audit will provide.

02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:22.840
Information obtained from the audit

02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:24.560
client, that is, from the one you

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:26.140
are checking, is one of the

02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:27.040
most unreliable.

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:29.240
You don't need to hang your

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:33.140
ears on your ears, think for yourself.

02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:35.940
And, in general, with such

02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:40.260
elementary thinking you can and identify

02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:42.500
the risks, and calculate them normally,

02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:45.500
and the card you will get beautiful.

02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:48.020
That is, you will not have 400 risks

02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:49.760
there on this map.

02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:52.160
And the board of directors you will

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.740
be able to be interested, and the money

02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:57.300
to get on it, and the program of events

02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:01.360
to use competently for the really

02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:02.860
main goal of increasing the

02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.080
sustainability of business

02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.420
activities.

02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:09.300
Good luck with risk management.

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:10.740


02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:13.820
At least from this course, you

02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:15.460
can emphasize, first,

02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:17.160
try to form a map of risks,

02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:20.520
understand what to pay

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:21.360
attention to.

02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:22.520
Someday you will

02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.280
become the biggest, the

02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:26.380
top managers.

02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:29.200
In this regard, I hope you remember

02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:30.780
this course.

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:33.260
may be useful.

02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:35.100
Good luck to all.

02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:35.860
thanks to.
