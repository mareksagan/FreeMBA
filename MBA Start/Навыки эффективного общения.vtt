00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Good afternoon, dear colleagues. Today we are going to discuss the topic of the presentation.

00:06.000 --> 00:16.000
I am Alexander Bobkov, business coach. My topic, my specialization is sales, negotiations, presentations, as well as time management and effective business communication.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
The topic of the commercial presentation is included in the block on the effective skills of business communication.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
Today we will discuss all the necessary elements of preparation and holding a commercial presentation.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
First, we will discuss what the concept of the purpose of the presentation is and what the task of the commercial presentation is.

00:39.000 --> 00:54.000
We will consider what actions and stages we are going through in the process of preparing the presentation, in the process of building its structure, in the process of selecting the words and key phrases from which the presentation will consist.

00:54.000 --> 01:12.000
We will consider what ways and methods you can establish contact with the audience, gain understanding, gain trust and do everything necessary for your presentation to achieve its goal, that is, to achieve the perception, attention and understanding of those people to whom it will be addressed.

01:12.000 --> 01:25.000
We will also consider how you can attract, retain and restore the attention of the audience that came to you, came to hear you, see you.

01:25.000 --> 01:41.000
We will also consider how and by what methods you can answer questions that come from the audience, what methods of argumentation to use and how to work with difficult cases, with cases when difficult questions come from the audience that require an answer.

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
And in conclusion, we will consider how and by what methods we can achieve an effective and effective completion of the presentation.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
How often do you have to make presentations?

01:53.000 --> 02:08.000
Probably everyone is different. At some points it requires us to be constantly involved. Sometimes we do it once in a while. In any case, whenever this does not happen, we require extreme concentration and understanding of what we are doing this presentation for.

02:08.000 --> 02:27.000
Any presentation has a purpose. The presentation is addressed to a certain circle of listeners and most likely has a certain topic. Sometimes you can hear and see presentations whose purpose is not clear, whose purpose is not clarified even by the speaker himself.

02:28.000 --> 02:41.000
The presentation is in the form of information, a collection of information that ends with the words, well, that's probably all, I said everything I wanted, the rest is at the discretion of the listeners.

02:41.000 --> 03:05.000
Your presentation, the presentation of the commercial plan, should have a completely specific goal. Make some changes, make some shift, plan some action and encourage those people who listen to you, those people who came to you for the presentation, those people whom you address with your informational message and whom you address with your convincing influence.

03:05.000 --> 03:32.000
Plan a specific result and your presentation will achieve the goal for which it was created. It is also important to understand that the goal of the presentation is not the goal itself, it is part of the solution to some larger task, some basic task. And having received the result of a specific presentation, you then, apparently, use this result, this solution to achieve a higher goal, a larger-scale goal.

03:32.000 --> 03:51.000
It is important to clearly understand how the result of your presentation will be used. It is important to understand how you will build it into the general context of your activity. This result should be interesting not only to you, of course, you mean your benefit or the benefit of those whom you represent at the presentation.

03:51.000 --> 04:06.000
It is also important to ensure that this goal, this benefit, is interesting to the audience. In this case, the audience will be faster, easier and more eager to follow you and respond to your call to encourage action.

04:21.000 --> 04:38.000
We all saw the weather forecast on TV. We see it every day. What do we hear? What do we see? A person speaks, he gives information, he gives information, he gives a weather forecast. Is this a presentation? Yes, to some extent it is.

04:38.000 --> 04:58.000
We receive information, but at the same time we do not get any motivation to act. This is the first, the very initial level of the presentation. The presentation is just for information. Here is a minimal direction to the belief and also a small direction to the information. Just give information.

04:58.000 --> 05:17.000
Another kind of presentation is when we see a candidate's speech at some elections, when we see a person who is burning with some idea and trying to convey this idea to the audience, to the public. And not just to convey this idea, but to infect it, to ignite the public.

05:17.000 --> 05:40.000
Again, I mean some kind of goal. In this case, in the case of a pre-election speech, to gather as many supporters as possible, to attract as many votes as possible at the elections. In this case, the informative part is small, but there is a great deal of impact, a great deal of desire to convince, a great deal of emotional message.

05:41.000 --> 05:56.000
The third case is when we see, for example, a commercial presentation of a person selling a product. In this case, we see a great deal of belief, a desire to sell a product, a desire to present in the best light all the characteristics, advantages and benefits of this product.

05:56.000 --> 06:18.000
And there is also a large and capacious informational part that allows the client, the potential buyer, to learn more and better about the product. All together creates a strong, bright, juicy and attractive picture. All together creates a picture of a commercial presentation that is filled with informational impact and convincing power.

06:19.000 --> 06:40.000
And the fourth version of the presentation, when we see, for example, a working meeting of a project group, when colleagues meet, who set their goal to inform each other about the state of affairs, about the position of things in the project. At the same time, they do not have any task to convince each other in any matter, they just inform.

06:41.000 --> 06:59.000
Different presentations, different degrees of combination of information and belief factors. We need to understand what our presentation will be about, what it will be aimed at. Will it be more aimed at informing people? Or is our task to convince, shift the point of view, help people understand something else?

06:59.000 --> 07:10.000
As soon as we determine this for ourselves, it will become clear to us how to prepare our presentation and what words, key phrases, actions we should put into it.

07:11.000 --> 07:27.000
For us, it is also important to analyze those people, the audience that will meet us in the hall. It is important for us to understand who is in the hall, it is important for us to understand for whom we will speak. Why is this important? Because different people perceive the information that we give in different ways.

07:27.000 --> 07:50.000
What is important to know about those people who are waiting for us in the audience? First, age and gender. Second, what social group do they belong to? Third, what interests do most of them pursue? And, perhaps, it is worth analyzing and foreseeing what their emotional state is at the moment of your appearance in the audience.

07:51.000 --> 08:04.000
The fact is that these factors are very important, because they affect the perception of the information that you are going to convey to the audience. It is important to take into account the characteristics of the audience when preparing your speech.

08:05.000 --> 08:17.000
Experts in the perception of a person have established that the best time to speak in front of young people, as well as elderly people and women, is in the evening, and most likely late in the evening.

08:18.000 --> 08:35.000
Because at this time, a person has the most developed perception of the emotional aspects of the speech. And there is a place for a variety of stories from life, there is a place for appeals to feelings, there is a place for stories about what you felt and what you were experiencing at that particular moment.

08:35.000 --> 09:01.000
It is good to address emotions at this moment. The morning time is also optimal for speaking in front of those people who are men in their mid-life, who have a well-developed rational side of perception. And the morning hours, the daytime hours, are a good time to provide facts, arguments, statistics, numbers, diagrams, demonstration of specific data on the studies, tests, and so on.

09:02.000 --> 09:18.000
So, we know who we are speaking in front of, we have planned the time of the speech, we imagine what we want to say. It is time to prepare for the presentation, it is time to go through the important three stages, three components of preparation.

09:18.000 --> 09:43.000
Imagine that you have to make a film, literally make a film about yourself. What is done first of all before making a film? The film is created on the basis of some literary work or script. It is important for us to write a script, it is important for us to put all these words into it, the main ones, the important ones, which must necessarily be voiced in front of our audience.

09:43.000 --> 10:01.000
The first stage is the lexical structure of the presentation. It is a verbal frame, it is a skeleton, if you want, on which we can then hang all the necessary components of the presentation.

10:01.000 --> 10:28.000
The second step is to understand at what point and in what sequence the following phrases, arguments, conclusions, some stories will be voiced. It is important for us to make a compositional plan of our presentation. The compositional plan includes the introduction, the introduction, then the main part, and then the conclusion. Each of these parts takes a certain time.

10:28.000 --> 10:47.000
In addition, it is important to predict how we will distribute our efforts during the presentation. At what point will we talk about one topic, at what point will we move on to another, how much time will we devote to some specific fact, how much time will we devote to each slide, if we use slides in the presentation.

10:47.000 --> 11:12.000
It is not a secret that before the presentation, each of us experiences some excitement, experiences a small amount of adrenaline. In this case, preparation is the best way to cope with such excitement, because preparation offers you clear knowledge of what you will talk about, in what sequence and how much time you will have for each logical and thematic block.

11:12.000 --> 11:38.000
In order to build a plan of the lexical structure of the presentation, it is important for you to understand what exactly the words you want to say to your audience. What will these words be about? It is important to plan, write down what should be voiced in your presentation, what are the main points, what are the facts, what arguments should be there so that the audience, hearing them, can make a decision on the results of the presentation easier.

11:39.000 --> 11:55.000
Any literary work is built according to the law of composition. Where does any book start? Does the main character take action immediately? No. First, we see the prologue, the description of events, the description of the situation in which the main part will unfold.

11:55.000 --> 12:14.000
Then the events begin, which make up the main part of the book. And somewhere in this book there is a shot, a decisive action is made, what is the basis, the culmination of the whole plot. Then follows the epilogue, that is, the exit from the situation, the conclusion.

12:14.000 --> 12:31.000
Your presentation can also be built according to the law of composition, according to the laws of the literary genre, according to the laws of creativity. After all, a strange-looking orator, a presenter, who, jumping on stage, immediately begins to tell something to those who have gathered about the product or their point of view.

12:44.000 --> 13:04.000
And then he will begin to talk about the properties, advantages, his point of view, what the audience needs, what are its benefits. In this case, it is important to understand that any process that we perform from the stage as a presenter can and should be built according to the law of composition.

13:04.000 --> 13:18.000
So, you know who is in the hall, you have built your presentation, you know what you will say and in what sequence. It is also important for you to understand how much time you will devote to each meaningful and logical block. The recommendations are as follows.

13:18.000 --> 13:42.000
Give no more than 20 minutes to one big topic. More time will simply not be perceived. Your audience will most likely get tired of listening to the same thing over and over again for more than 20 minutes. Change the topic, move on to the next question, change the style of presentation, change the form of presentation, change something every 20 minutes.

13:42.000 --> 14:11.000
It is also important to remember that one logical block, one part of the topic can be in the focus of attention for no more than 6 minutes. After 6 minutes, make a logical pause, draw attention to something, make a change so that people's perception is refreshed and they can see something new in the topic you are discussing from a different point of view.

14:12.000 --> 14:32.000
And if you use slides, spend no more than 3 minutes to consider each topic on each slide. 3 minutes is the limit for which the slide attracts attention. After 3 minutes, it is important to change the slide and move on to the next block of consideration of your topic.

14:32.000 --> 14:59.000
How important are the first seconds of your appearance in front of the audience? This is the golden time, these are the seconds during which you make the first impression on your audience. Of course, it is very desirable that this impression is favorable. This is the basis of your performance. Many presentations fail in these seconds. And also many presentations are made in the first seconds of your appearance.

14:59.000 --> 15:15.000
Why is this so? Because in these seconds people make the first impression on you, and then it acts during the entire presentation. The audience projects the impression you made during the first seconds of your appearance on you.

15:15.000 --> 15:40.000
What is the most important thing to consider in these initial and very important moments of the presentation? First, how you appear, how you come to your audience. It is no secret that the components of the first impression include several factors. We receive information on different channels. And the most powerful of them, the biggest, is the channel of visual perception.

15:40.000 --> 16:09.000
We all know this proverb. And the appearance of a new person in front of us is perceived primarily by what we see. And what do we see? How he is dressed, how he looks, how he moves, how he walks, how he looks, how he holds his head. There are many different details, many different moments that attract our attention, and we perceive them as a whole. We make the first impression on how a person moves.

16:10.000 --> 16:34.000
Your appearance to the audience is your self-presentation. It is how you hold yourself, how you behave in these minutes. Getting out of the table, getting up from the hall to the stage, getting out of the backstage. All these are golden seconds that largely determine how the audience will perceive you.

16:35.000 --> 16:51.000
When you go out to the audience, to those people who were waiting for you, it is important to take a short pause, not to rush into battle right away, not to start talking as soon as you appeared on stage. Take a few seconds of pause. For what?

16:51.000 --> 17:16.000
In order to get acquainted with the audience, in order to establish a so-called visual contact, it is enough to just run through the eyes, stopping at each one for no more than half a second. Those people who respond to your gaze, just thank them with your eyes, say hello with your eyes. Those who have not yet seen you, just miss.

17:16.000 --> 17:31.000
It is important to find several allies in the hall, several people who are already ready to perceive you. In the future, you will be able to use this support to melt the ice of the whole hall, if not all people have yet paid attention to you.

17:31.000 --> 17:54.000
Visual contact is a confirmation of your status. You went on stage, you take the situation into your hands, you show who came. And then the words of greeting follow, then the words that can have different meanings in one. You start talking, you turn on the audio channel of perception for your listeners.

17:55.000 --> 18:08.000
Our speech consists of two important components. Firstly, this is a vocal channel, that is, a channel that reflects the voice characteristics of speech. The tone, the volume, the intonation, the pace of speech.

18:08.000 --> 18:22.000
Secondly, this is the meaning of the words. The channel is called verbal. It is important to understand that in the first seconds the greatest emphasis, the greatest attention is paid to the voice characteristics of speech, to how you speak.

18:22.000 --> 18:38.000
And here, perhaps, the richest and most important component for change is the intonation component. The intonation with which you go to the audience, how you greet it. What intonation will be optimal in this case for greeting?

18:38.000 --> 18:56.000
It is important to understand what kind of audience you are speaking to. If the audience is business, that is, people who are going to receive information, who are going to make a rational decision, most likely a neutral business will suit, but at the same time dynamic, filled with enthusiasm, intonation.

18:56.000 --> 19:10.000
If you speak in front of an audience of people who prefer an emotional type of speech, most likely a warmer, more intense, more provocative speech, contact and intonation are needed.

19:10.000 --> 19:31.000
Greetings, in addition to your self-presentation, in addition to the reflection of your emotional state in the form of intonation, also carry the function of creating a certainty. You greet the audience, you say who you are, you name the topic of the speech, and the audience becomes more clear who is who.

19:31.000 --> 19:45.000
The roles are determined, you are the presenter, the audience is the listener. More certainty is created and the center of this certainty is you. You helped the audience feel themselves in their place and now you will start your presentation.

19:45.000 --> 20:01.000
Also, at the beginning of the presentation, you can make a small action that will help you feel like the host of the situation. The feeling of the host on stage is an important condition of the presenter, because it is in his hands that the management of the whole situation is.

20:01.000 --> 20:17.000
At the beginning of the presentation, you can make a simple action. Ask the audience about something that will allow them to raise their hands, ask who came to the subway today, raise your hands, the audience will respond.

20:17.000 --> 20:35.000
Ask someone to move the table, turn on the light, fix the glass on the windows. Any action that is carried out at your request already shows that you have control over the situation here and the situation of managing the presentation is in your hands.

20:35.000 --> 20:49.000
Speaking of a commercial presentation, it is important to remember about the structure that will help you achieve your goals and lead the audience to make a decision. This structure consists of four steps. The first of them is to attract attention.

20:49.000 --> 21:05.000
It is important at the beginning of the presentation to set a topic, a direction of conversation that will be interesting to the audience, which will attract it and make it pay attention to what you say. Attracting attention is the first step in the presentation structure.

21:05.000 --> 21:20.000
Then it is important to make everything necessary for the audience to have an interest in what you offer, what you tell, what you sell. Attracting interest is the second step in the structure of a commercial presentation.

21:20.000 --> 21:36.000
The next step is to arouse the desire of people to take advantage of what you offer, to buy what you sell, to arouse emotional feelings in them, to arouse a desire, motivation to purchase or use your goods or services.

21:36.000 --> 21:56.000
And at the end of the presentation, it is necessary to do everything so that people take action, go and buy, vote, decide and do what you offer. It is important to include in the conclusion of the presentation the encouraging moment, the words that encourage the audience to act.

21:56.000 --> 22:04.000
Of course, you encourage the audience to take action that is beneficial to you and to those whom you represent by conducting a commercial presentation.

22:04.000 --> 22:17.000
How to attract the audience's attention at the very beginning? What to start with so that all the views of those sitting in the conference room are addressed to you? What techniques, what methods can be used?

22:18.000 --> 22:40.000
First, you can start with some kind of statement. For example, you know, I have one question that I suppose not many of you here will answer affirmatively. And perhaps this will attract more views if you started with a presentation that does not concern everyone in the conference room.

22:41.000 --> 23:02.000
You can start with some fresh news on the topic of the presentation. If you speak in front of a company that works in a certain industry, it may be interesting to hear some fresh report from the State Commissariat on this market. It may be interesting to hear the news from the industry exhibition or the release of some new product under the brand of a well-known brand.

23:03.000 --> 23:13.000
This news will also attract attention, will allow you to collect views, to collect the focus of the audience's attention, and then to make a bridge to move on to the topic you wanted to talk about in the presentation.

23:14.000 --> 23:34.000
The beginning that attracts attention can also be considered a dramatic beginning, when you intentionally, deliberately emphasizing the words, start the presentation. For example, in this case, ladies and gentlemen, the topic of the presentation is important to all of us today, this topic, and then you announce the topic.

23:34.000 --> 24:03.000
Intentional emphasis allows to attract the attention of those who are going to the presentation. Or you can start the presentation with a ball throw, throw the topic into the audience, say, for example, you know, before the presentation I talked to some of the participants and met with different points of view, help me figure it out, I heard about this one and also heard another, what point of view of your audience will be correct.

24:04.000 --> 24:15.000
Perhaps the participants will be able to respond to this discussion, and then you can direct this discussion to the right course, asking the topic that was planned as a topic of the presentation.

24:15.000 --> 24:27.000
The main thing in the management of attention is the following. It is important to constantly vary the focus of attention, change it, surprise with something sometimes, and keep the attention that you won at the very beginning.

24:28.000 --> 24:40.000
The presentation that you make in front of the audience is not so prepared for your speech, and perhaps some controversial questions, objections will be met sometimes with questions.

24:41.000 --> 24:48.000
Sometimes you will hear objections to your address, acute questions that will require from you, concentration, cold blood and endurance.

24:49.000 --> 24:59.000
How to work with objections that are voiced in the presentation? First, let your opponent, the person speaking, to speak out completely.

25:00.000 --> 25:10.000
For this person, the question he is talking about is important, he is emotionally touched by it, and it is important that the person expresses himself in this emotion completely, that he says everything he wants to say.

25:11.000 --> 25:23.000
Even if you already have a ready answer to this question, which you may have heard repeatedly in this composition, let the person speak out, finish the question to the end. This is an important condition.

25:23.000 --> 25:35.000
Then, having asked again, clarify the understanding of the question. Perhaps it is even worth rephrasing the question so that it takes on the form, the appearance in which you will work more comfortably with it.

25:36.000 --> 25:48.000
Rephrase, clarify the understanding, ask the question for understanding. I understand you correctly, you mean this and that. And ask the question in the form that is most convenient for you.

25:49.000 --> 26:06.000
And then express your understanding and acceptance of the situation. Expressing understanding does not mean agreeing with the objector. It is important to admit that such a point of view, such a view of the problem, such an opinion simply takes place.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
Such a point of view can exist and it is normal. You express your acceptance and understanding of this fact.

26:14.000 --> 26:30.000
Then, when you have joined this expression, joined the understanding of this question, you can give this information, facts, arguments that help your opponent understand that you have this information and are ready to respond to objections.

26:30.000 --> 26:41.000
What is the effectiveness, what is the benefit of such a method of working with objections? It is important to understand that we do not argue with the opponent, we do not try to convince him that we are right.

26:42.000 --> 26:59.000
We accept his point of view and share information, acting as allies. Thus, if we have processed the objection correctly, most likely this person will understand that we are not tuned to the battle, not tuned to the conflict and ready to work constructively, sharing information, helping to better understand.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
the question that we raised in the presentation.

27:05.000 --> 27:17.000
In the case when we need to prove something, in the case when we have arguments that confirm the facts we have said in the presentation, it is important to comply with some important requirements when selecting these arguments.

27:17.000 --> 27:30.000
First, the argument must be verified, its credibility must be indisputable, it must be of those that do not require special evidence and most likely will be accepted at once.

27:31.000 --> 27:39.000
It is good to indicate the source from which you have this information, from where you got this information, what helped you to make sure of the credibility of this argument.

27:39.000 --> 27:57.000
The argument is an influence directed at the point of view, but not the opponent. The opponent who expresses an objection, he just shares his point of view with you. Therefore, there should be nothing personal in the argument, directed at the person with whom you communicate, arguing some point of view.

27:57.000 --> 28:13.000
It is good if the argument is confirmed by some visual evidence, it is confirmed by graphs, numbers, diagrams, illustrations, if there is some plot showing that the argument is credible, if there is some video recording, it is great.

28:13.000 --> 28:36.000
The clarity helps to make sure that this argument is reliable and can be trusted. If you communicate with an audience that is not specialists in the field you are talking about, it is good to use a language free of terms, special words, various professional terms, use an accessible language so that people have a complete understanding of what you are talking about.

28:36.000 --> 29:05.000
Sometimes you can decode the terms you use so that they are understood by the audience, and then use the terms that are already decoded in your presentation. In order to show the audience the meaning of these terms, it is enough to decode them once, show their meaning, perhaps give some examples, demonstrations, illustrations. This will help the audience later to perceive the terms as understandable to them.

29:06.000 --> 29:21.000
One more rule about arguments. Declare them as the degree of strength increases. From strong to stronger and finally to the strongest. So that the audience remembers the argument that was the strongest. It will sound at the end.

29:21.000 --> 29:34.000
So, having gone through the stages of the introduction, the main part, and approaching the conclusion, it is important to summarize, it is important to complete the presentation in such a way that it helps to achieve the set goal.

29:51.000 --> 30:04.000
It is important to show that the situation that is important, which requires intervention, which requires decisions, to show that the offer of your presentation will help to solve this situation, will help to cope with the tasks that are in front of the audience.

30:04.000 --> 30:26.000
And give perspective, give a bridge to the future, show how the adoption of a specific decision by the audience will help it in the future, will help it either avoid something or achieve something. So that the audience understands how the decision made today will affect the situation in the future, will affect their life, their well-being, their well-being.

30:26.000 --> 30:50.000
And the fourth step is the most important. Make an encouraging impact, encourage the audience to specific actions. Say literally, so buy, so buy, use, win, vote, or whatever you want to say. It is important that the audience hears this not as an opportunity, but as a call, as an encouragement to action.

30:50.000 --> 31:13.000
Complete the presentation on an emotional rise. This is important to summarize, because the presentation is remembered by the last words, by the last gestures. It is remembered that the presenter made a farewell. Make a striking performance, make a performance on a rise. Show the audience that you leave it filled with energy and enthusiasm, so that the audience remembers you in this way.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Business training on sales, negotiations, effective business communication, presentations, and time management.

31:18.000 --> 31:38.000
Good afternoon, dear colleagues. I am Alexander Bobkov, a business trainer on sales, negotiations, effective business communication, presentations, and time management. Today we will talk about a very specific type of business communication. Within the course of the skill of effective communication, we will talk about business negotiations.

31:39.000 --> 32:01.000
Business negotiations are an integral part of any business. Negotiations are carried out at all levels. Back-office employees negotiate with suppliers of goods and services to ensure the life of the enterprise. Sales managers negotiate with customers about the sale of goods and services, about supplies, about partnerships.

32:02.000 --> 32:24.000
Employees of the top management team negotiate with contractors, negotiate with partner companies, ensuring the strategic plans of the company's development. In any case, negotiations are communication, contact with the outside world, the goal of which is to ensure growth, prosperity, and life.

32:25.000 --> 32:35.000
In negotiations, the most important thing is communication with the outside world. The company strives to achieve the goals that it sets for itself in its growth and development.

32:36.000 --> 32:48.000
Today, during our video course, we will discuss the following topics. First, we will discuss the purpose of negotiations and what tasks a negotiator can solve by building a negotiation process.

32:49.000 --> 33:06.000
Then we will discuss what actions will be useful at the stage of preparation for negotiations. And we will consider how a negotiator, as a person conducting negotiations, can build and what he should pay attention to in his behavior, taking into account his personal properties.

33:07.000 --> 33:21.000
We will study what negotiation strategies can be chosen by each party during negotiations. And we will also consider several tactical approaches that will help you achieve your goal of conducting your negotiations.

33:22.000 --> 33:32.000
We will conclude our video course with several methods of achieving an agreement. The achievement of the agreement that will be the result of the negotiations you have conducted will serve your goals.

33:33.000 --> 33:47.000
Before going to negotiations, we, of course, imagine what goal and what result we want to achieve. What do we want to achieve as a result of this meeting, as a result of the act of communication with the participating party in negotiations?

33:48.000 --> 34:03.000
And in this case, it is important that the goal that we set for ourselves is extremely specific. It is important to clearly understand what exactly we want to achieve, what result, what change, what event we want to achieve as a result of the negotiations.

34:04.000 --> 34:18.000
It is important that this goal is formulated in a positive way. For example, I will get, not I will not lose. I will achieve, so it is right. And I can avoid the wrong option.

34:19.000 --> 34:28.000
It is important that this goal is positive, motivating and engaging, that you understand what good will happen, what good will happen as a result of the negotiations you have conducted.

34:29.000 --> 34:42.000
It is important that the goal formulation assumes that it depends only on you. This is a goal that is in your hands. The correct formulation of this kind is, I will ensure the signing of a contract with our partners.

34:43.000 --> 35:04.000
The formulation that excludes your participation is, they will sign the contract, the other party will sign the contract. This goal does not depend on you. The goal when you ensure the signing of your actions, your efforts, this goal, which depends on you, and it will stimulate you more, motivate you more to achieve it during the negotiations.

35:04.000 --> 35:31.000
It is also important that the goal is specific, that it is measurable, if possible. For example, increase sales by 30%. This is the correct formulation of the goal. If you are thinking about how to sell more by the end of the negotiations, this goal is not specific and, most likely, it needs to be concretized, that is, expressed in a specific figure, in an exact figure, the increase of what, the growth of what and how much you want to achieve as a result of the negotiations you have conducted.

35:31.000 --> 35:45.000
Defining the goals of the negotiations for ourselves, we must also understand what tasks we must solve, building up the negotiation process with our counteragents. We need to understand what tasks will be solved as a result of these negotiations.

35:45.000 --> 36:07.000
The tasks may concern both business relations and business results. We need to understand what we want to achieve first, what we want to achieve second, and what we should also worry about third. For example, it may be that the main task of these negotiations will be to conclude a contract with some company.

36:07.000 --> 36:34.000
At the same time, the task of the second level will be to maintain partnership for the next period. And the task of the third level is to create prerequisites for signing a more significant, larger contract next year with this company, based on several years of full-fledged cooperation. That is, each task that is solved in the negotiation process may concern both the present time and the time in the future.

36:34.000 --> 37:01.000
It is also important for us to understand how the task that we solve in the negotiation process takes into account the interests of the other party. It is important for us to assume what the other party will get in return, how its interests will be taken into account, if the task of the negotiations is fulfilled, is solved. This will help us avoid pulling the blanket over ourselves when we only mean our interests and do not care that the interests of the other party are also observed.

37:01.000 --> 37:22.000
And when we are setting up a negotiation task, we need to understand what task of a higher level will help us to achieve the success of specific negotiations. If we return from negotiations with the result we have achieved, where do we then put this result? What task of a higher level will help us to achieve the result of the negotiations we have achieved?

37:31.000 --> 37:51.000
First, it is important to clearly define the needs of each party from the very beginning. Of course, we know our needs clearly. It is also important to assume what interests the mutual party pursues, what interests our opponent, the partner in negotiations pursues.

38:01.000 --> 38:24.000
And to motivate him to sign the contract, taking into account what the other party wants as a result of the negotiations. It is also important for us to foresee how and in what ways we can satisfy our needs and offer ways to satisfy the needs of the other party in exchange for some mutual concessions in our favor.

38:24.000 --> 38:49.000
It is important to prepare several options in advance for how this or that goal of the negotiations will be achieved. What are the possibilities? What are the options? What can be done differently? What can be done taking into account the changing situation? So that the other party understands that we do not mean only one option to satisfy our needs, but also think about the ways that will help the other party achieve its results.

38:49.000 --> 39:03.000
In preparation for a proposal on specific issues, it is important for us to understand what objective criteria are there for making a decision on this issue. It is important to understand what norms, what stereotypes correspond to a particular decision.

39:03.000 --> 39:24.000
If, for example, we are trying to make a decision on some issue, we mean the range within which the decision on this issue will be considered normal. For example, we offer our partner to increase the number of supplied products by 20%. At the same time, we understand that the supply within this figure is normal.

39:25.000 --> 39:44.000
We do not require more, we do not require to increase the supply by 50%, because objective criteria show us that this kind of supply is not possible for our partner. He simply will not have time to produce such a quantity. Therefore, we can insist on and offer this kind of increase as a normal increase that fits into the objective criteria on this issue.

39:44.000 --> 40:03.000
It is important to be ready in the negotiation process for the emergence of alternative solutions, for the emergence of a situation in which the decision you propose will seem unacceptable to the other party, for example, due to some changed circumstances, due to reasons that you did not know about before the negotiations.

40:03.000 --> 40:20.000
It is important to foresee this and to offer the other party an alternative solution that will allow you to show your readiness to act even in a changed situation. And the other party, having assessed this, will be able to develop a solution for itself according to your proposal.

40:20.000 --> 40:41.000
And a good support in the solution of the purpose of the negotiations will be an option to achieve an agreement, a contract, a protocol on intentions, some formulation that will be offered to you as a product, as a result of this negotiation session, which can be agreed upon, changed, supplemented with some considerations of the other party.

40:42.000 --> 40:54.000
But the framework, the template and your proposal, the option of agreement, will be for you, and this will also be assessed by the other party as readiness to conduct a negotiation process at a high professional level.

40:54.000 --> 41:01.000
Tell me, when did you hold the last negotiations? What were the negotiations like? With whom? On what basis?

41:01.000 --> 41:14.000
You probably remember your feelings from the first meeting with this person, with this party, and you remember what you may have lacked in these negotiations to achieve the important and necessary goal.

41:14.000 --> 41:24.000
And maybe everything went well and you achieved what you wanted and got it knowing why, knowing what helped you and what influenced the outcome of these negotiations.

41:24.000 --> 41:36.000
What qualities, what sides of the personality, what characteristics of the negotiator influence the outcome of negotiations in one way or another? What qualities help to achieve success in negotiations?

41:36.000 --> 41:50.000
First, it is purposefulness, a clear vision, a clear format of the goal, a clear understanding of what I am going to achieve, what I want to achieve, what result I need as a result of these negotiations.

41:50.000 --> 42:06.000
And no matter what happens, no matter what the topic is, no matter which way your interlocutor is distracted, you always know what to look for, what channel to follow, what course to follow and which way to move the negotiation process.

42:06.000 --> 42:16.000
This is your goal, the goal that you planned in advance, outlined and even wrote down for yourself in order to remember what goal is in front of you in these negotiations.

42:17.000 --> 42:29.000
Secondly, the hardness of the ability to resist pressure and, perhaps, the same professional approach to negotiating that another country uses is important.

42:29.000 --> 42:42.000
The hardness of the ability to defend your position, the hardness of the belief that the position you are defending is correct and can be accepted as the starting point for the completion of negotiations.

42:42.000 --> 43:06.000
And also, a successful negotiator requires patience, the ability to look for, study, learn alternative points of view, alternative ways to solve problems, and to consider possible ways of satisfaction for both yourself and your mutual benefit.

43:07.000 --> 43:14.000
What qualities can interfere? What barriers are in the way to success in negotiations?

43:14.000 --> 43:24.000
First, it is the expectation of the obvious. When negotiating, it is important to be prepared for the fact that they may not go as you imagine.

43:24.000 --> 43:34.000
Another country may propose some other proposals, it may propose some other solutions to the problems discussed in the negotiations.

43:34.000 --> 43:41.000
Anything can happen, including the fact that the person you expected will not appear at the negotiations, but another representative of the company.

43:41.000 --> 43:53.000
The agenda of the day may change, the place of the negotiations may change. It is important to be prepared for the fact that you will have to achieve your goals in different circumstances, in different conditions, with another person.

43:53.000 --> 44:03.000
This kind of flexibility and readiness, openness to new things, openness to change in the situation, helps to keep your lines and achieve success in negotiations.

44:03.000 --> 44:15.000
Barriers to success in negotiations also include self-doubt, the lack of confidence that I have the right to claim and insist on taking my point of view.

44:15.000 --> 44:30.000
Self-confidence is an important part of the negotiation process. You may be tested, you may be checked, you may be pushed by another country in order to achieve your goal in negotiations.

44:30.000 --> 44:39.000
Self-confidence is a way to resist pressure, it is a way to insist on taking your point of view, a way to achieve your goal in negotiations.

44:39.000 --> 44:55.000
The third barrier to success in negotiations is conformity, that is, the desire to comply with some norms, rules, the desire to arrange everything in order to take the point of view offered by the other side.

44:55.000 --> 45:12.000
In negotiations, conformity is unacceptable. It is important to understand that, of course, compromises can be made, it is important to take the opinion of the other side into account, but it is not worth striving for taking another point of view without a contract and not insisting on mutual concessions.

45:12.000 --> 45:28.000
What is the basis of negotiations? How does the theater start? The negotiations start with the meeting of two people who, of course, first of all, evaluate each other. Two people meet and evaluate each other, first of all, on the external signs.

45:28.000 --> 45:41.000
The first seconds, the first meeting, a handshake, and two people immediately make an opinion of each other. What impression would you like to make on your opponent, on your partner in negotiations?

45:41.000 --> 46:03.000
Most likely, he will be able to understand that in front of him is a respectable person, serious, knowledgeable and striving to achieve the agreements that represent the company, the side that has weight, has respect, respects itself and is ready to negotiate with the same partners.

46:03.000 --> 46:19.000
Everything is important here. The appearance is important, the clothes, accessories, the state of the clothes, the state of your hairstyle, the state of your face, even the smell from your mouth is also important.

46:19.000 --> 46:34.000
It is important that no detail contradicts the composition of your presentation as a person who is successful, who represents a successful company, while being ready to go to negotiations, ready to discuss, consider various points of view.

46:34.000 --> 46:51.000
In addition to the appearance, the nature of the gestures and movements that you make from the very beginning is also important. Even those movements that you make towards your partner in negotiations are already being evaluated by him, he already makes an impression, makes an idea of ​​you.

46:51.000 --> 47:09.000
How do you go? Confidently, waving, looking ahead, or are you going without confidence, as if you were visiting? From this moment on, your party can determine for itself what position it will take in negotiations. Your party will understand what is to be done.

47:09.000 --> 47:23.000
It is important to find a compromise, or you can sit down, push, use your weakness and self-doubt, if it is there, if it is seen. Your pose and facial expression, your facial expression, also play a big role.

47:23.000 --> 47:45.000
If we talk about negotiations while standing, then it is important that you take an open position in relation to the side with which you are negotiating. This means not to cross your hands, not to close your limbs, keep your head straight, turn your shoulders and show with all your appearance that you are ready for contact, ready for dialogue, ready to negotiate.

47:45.000 --> 47:57.000
In this case, even if you are sitting, it is important to keep your back straight so that your partner understands that you are ready, you are in the right tone, you are ready to have effective and effective negotiations.

47:57.000 --> 48:07.000
What should the negotiator's facial expression be like? Most likely, it should be such that your partner understands that you are an open, safe person and are able to experience some emotions.

48:07.000 --> 48:33.000
Of course, the face should not resemble a mask, a frozen mask that does not reflect anything. Although, on the other hand, in the case when you participate in negotiations on issues important to you and important to your partner, the face should be under control and not express some joy about what has happened, some dismay about the argument heard.

48:33.000 --> 48:41.000
In these cases, the face should accept the usual expression of a benevolent readiness for dialogue, for the negotiation process.

48:41.000 --> 48:56.000
In addition to the appearance, in addition to the characteristics that can be observed, your partner also evaluates you in terms of how your voice sounds. And here we can divide the voice into several components.

48:56.000 --> 49:13.000
What is considered in negotiations? What does your partner hear? He hears your tone, he hears your intonation, he hears the tone of speech, he perceives the volume of the voice and he also perceives your diction.

49:13.000 --> 49:30.000
As for each of the components of the voice, you can give several recommendations. If we are talking about intonation, then intonation should express your attitude, your emotional state, express your position on a particular issue.

49:30.000 --> 49:53.000
A passionate monotone voice in negotiations will most likely be perceived as the voice of a person who does not own the situation and does not express a personal attitude to it. In the case when you color your voice and your speech intonationally, the interlocutor's perception is tuned to you as well as to the person who represents the company, but also has a personal attitude to the issue.

49:53.000 --> 50:11.000
As for the volume of the voice, the optimum volume is not perceived as a pressure, not perceived as a pressure. The volume should be such that a person sitting in two steps from where you are sitting or standing in the middle of a conversation can easily hear it.

50:11.000 --> 50:35.000
Speaking of the volume of speech, we must also link this with the characteristics of diction. The standard volume of speech, which is optimal for the average human brain, is 250-270 words per minute. Pronunciation at this rate guarantees that not a single word from your speech will be lost and your interlocutor will catch and hear each of the words you have spoken.

50:35.000 --> 50:54.000
It is important to remember that voice characteristics provide good diction even at a high pace of speech. If your pace is excessive, if the dictionary component suffers, it is better to slow down so that each word is clearly heard and your interlocutor does not have trouble understanding you.

50:54.000 --> 51:21.000
And last but not least, your interlocutor pays attention to the meaning of the words you say. At the first minute, this is not so important, at the first minute, it is most likely that the attention is paid to the voice characteristics, but then, of course, it all depends on how you arrange your negotiations, how you arrange the meaning of the sentences that you address to the opposing party.

51:21.000 --> 51:33.000
When preparing for negotiations, choose which strategy you will take in relation to your opponent. There are probably four strategies, four choices of tactics in your negotiations.

51:33.000 --> 51:50.000
The first strategy is to say, I won, he lost. In this case, we assume that we will try to make our decision, the decision that we propose as a result of the negotiations, be adopted in all possible ways and methods.

51:50.000 --> 52:11.000
At the same time, we will not care that the other party achieves the options that would satisfy it. It is important to understand that by achieving such a temporary advantage, even if our other party accepts the decision we propose, we can lose in the long run.

52:11.000 --> 52:33.000
We can lose a valuable partner, a valuable opponent, lose in relations. And such a position, if it is engaged from the very beginning of the negotiations, rarely leads to a constructive decision. It is rare for a party to fully agree to what the other party offers it and does not require any mutual concessions.

52:34.000 --> 52:50.000
The second strategy is to say, I lost, he won. In this case, we choose a strategy of concessions, a strategy of following the course outlined by your opponent. And this choice can be made only in one case.

52:50.000 --> 53:11.000
When you clearly understand why you make this concession, what you allow your opponent to win, what further steps follow, how you use this temporary concession, this help to your opponent so that he gets what he needs at this moment as a result of the negotiations.

53:12.000 --> 53:33.000
The third strategy is, I lost, he lost. This strategy is not often perceived as a plan of negotiations, it is not consciously chosen. However, it is rather a product, a fruit of the attitude to negotiations as a competition, when each party strives to get a 100% result.

53:33.000 --> 53:55.000
In this case, it all ends with the two parties diverging without achieving any agreement. It is considered normal when each party seeks to make a decision that meets their interests by 80%. It is very rare that both parties get exactly what they wanted at 100%.

53:55.000 --> 54:06.000
If the ratio of 80 to 80 is observed, then in this case the maximum satisfaction of each party is guaranteed by what they achieved in negotiations.

54:07.000 --> 54:24.000
And the fourth strategy is, I won, he won. This is the most optimal strategy that allows you to achieve a compromise, that allows you to achieve that each party gets what it wants. At the same time, it is important that each party gets exactly what is valuable to it.

54:25.000 --> 54:41.000
And here it is possible to have a bargaining, it is possible to have a positional negotiation, or it is possible to find a compromise on some fundamental issues, when the parties make mutual concessions to each other, sacrificing what is not so valuable to them.

54:41.000 --> 54:52.000
But for the other party, it is valuable, important, and it is happy to accept this concession, sacrificing in return what is not so important to it, but is important to the other party.

54:53.000 --> 55:09.000
In any case, it is important to understand that a mutual win lays the foundation for a more dense, longer-term and mutually beneficial cooperation, rather than when we strive for our own win, but do not provide benefits and advantages for the other party.

55:09.000 --> 55:19.000
What role can a negotiator play in the negotiation process? What can he strive for in the negotiation process? What tactics should be used?

55:19.000 --> 55:30.000
It all depends on how much and how we want to combine the ratio of two important factors. First, this is a business result, and secondly, this is a result in the form of relations.

55:31.000 --> 55:44.000
If for us the most important thing is to maintain relations with the other party, and the business result is not so important to us, then our role can be close to the role that is described in the words of self-kindness,

55:45.000 --> 55:55.000
when we are ready to sacrifice part of the business result in order to maintain relations with the other party and arrange the negotiation process in such a way that the relations are in the foreground.

55:55.000 --> 56:08.000
We show our opponent that we are ready to make concessions in order to maintain relations, partnership, and the style of cooperation that was in the work of our companies.

56:09.000 --> 56:22.000
If we believe that there is no point in looking for a compromise in the form of relations or business results, then the style can be close to the style described in the words of an analyst.

56:22.000 --> 56:33.000
We just consider what options and results can be beneficial to us and we lead our policy in order to help the other party to accept this point of view.

56:34.000 --> 56:42.000
But at the same time, neither relations nor relations are too important to us, and at the same time we are not so focused on the business result.

56:43.000 --> 56:55.000
If we are primarily interested in the business result and the relationship is not important to us, then the role of such a position can be close to the role described in the words of the godfather,

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
a person who cares about the result, a person who cares about the business result, sometimes even to the detriment of relations.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
Relations built on competition provide exactly this kind of position.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
We strive to get the result at almost any cost, sometimes even at the cost of relations.

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
And if we are ready for this, then our role is close to the position described by the godfather.

57:20.000 --> 57:32.000
And yet the most optimal, the most reasonable and the most productive position is the position called virtuoso, when we strive to take into account,

57:33.000 --> 57:43.000
strive to achieve the interests of both our country and the country of our opponent, our partner, when we care about the country of relations and care about the business result.

57:44.000 --> 57:51.000
It is important to remember that these two factors are closely interconnected, and if we take care of relations with our country today,

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
perhaps tomorrow it will be the basis for obtaining a more complete, more substantial business result.

57:58.000 --> 58:08.000
And also cooperation in the business sphere, more close, more dense, helps to build relations that will later become the basis for some new contracts, deals, projects.

58:09.000 --> 58:17.000
Perhaps the fifth position is also intermediate, when we strive to find literally in all the compromise, to reach some middle ground.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
The position is not simple, the position requires attention and attention to your interests, attention to the interests of the opponent.

58:25.000 --> 58:32.000
The position is called a compromiser, that is, a person looking for a compromise in the issues that are discussed in negotiations.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
It is important to remember that a compromise is not always a good thing for your country.

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
It is important to remember that any compromise brings partiality, brings imperfection, a failure to achieve the result you wanted.

58:46.000 --> 58:52.000
But if this is an option that we accept, which we provide for you, then your role can be exactly this,

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
a search for the middle ground, a search for compromises in all the issues that you discuss.

58:58.000 --> 59:05.000
It is important to understand that your role is most often and most likely depends on the goal that you set for the negotiations.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
Choose a role according to the goal of your negotiations.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
Any negotiations begin with mutual clarification of positions.

59:14.000 --> 59:21.000
It is clear that before the start of negotiations, the approximate position of the negotiator of the country that opposes you is clear.

59:21.000 --> 59:28.000
It is still important to clarify the current position for today, for now, for this time, this day, this place.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
The clarification of positions is carried out by asking questions.

59:33.000 --> 59:42.000
We ask, clarifying what is important to us, what is important for us to understand, before we start acting in the negotiation process, seeking to make our decision.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
What questions can be used?

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
As a rule, everything starts with open questions.

59:49.000 --> 59:56.000
Open questions are questions that do not provide a clear answer, but offer to express themselves, start a discussion,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
open up a conversation that helps both sides clarify their positions.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Open questions can start with words like, what do you think about, or what is your opinion on this and that, what would you say about this and that.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Often, to start a business conversation, a topic that has nothing to do with the topic of negotiations is used.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
A so-called small conversation is concluded, in which both sides share some news that has nothing to do with the topic of the meeting.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And then, some of the parties make a logical transition, make a bridge to the topic that is important to both.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
In this case, open questions allow to start this discussion, to start the discussion that is important to both sides.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Then, in the negotiation process, closed questions can also be used.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Closed questions offer a clear, unambiguous answer, yes or no.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Closed questions allow to determine the position that each side occupies in the negotiation process, when it is important to do this and get a meaningful, accurate answer, yes or no.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Questions can also have an alternative nature, when we offer to accept one of the two options we offer, either this or that.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
How do you think, you could take this position or that position?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
How do you think, this option or that option will suit you?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:34.000
We offer two options, two alternatives, and our partner can choose the option that is most suitable for him in this matter.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Questions can have a counter-nature, and in this case, they are a way to intercept the initiative, when we need to take control of the negotiation process, when we need to take control of the negotiation process.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Counter-questions are questions that we ask in the same topic, as the questioner has been offered, but have a nature of clarification, clarification or detail.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000
We ask a counter-question, giving it a clarification, otherwise it will have a too confrontational nature.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:19.000
If we do not need this, we ask a clarification question, explaining why we are asking this question, what purpose we are asking it for, and what we want to clarify, clarify, clarify for ourselves with its help.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Questions that do not require an answer can also be used in negotiations.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Rhetorical questions are used to confirm or emphasize your attitude to any question, to emphasize your position, or to start some logical block or to complete such a block, summing up what has already been said.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
The main thing to remember is that the types of questions can be used in different ways.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
First, it is important to remember what result you want to come to, asking these questions and clarifying the position of your partner.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It is important for us to understand what we should work with in the negotiation process, what is the position of the other party, what opinion is expressed with the partner on a particular question.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
A variety of types of questions help to do this.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:20.000
When communicating with your partner, it is important to remember that he requires constant attention to our side, and it is important for us to confirm this attention and also to express our attention to the words that the opponent says.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
For this, you can use the so-called active listening techniques.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Even if the speech has the character of a monologue and your partner is speaking, talking about something important to him, we can give this monologue the character of a dialogue using the active listening technique.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000
There are several simple techniques that allow us to participate in a conversation without stress and without saying a minimum of words with maximum participation.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
The simplest and most easily used technique is the mirror technique.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:12.000
When we listen to each phrase of our opponent, our partner in a conversation, we simply return the last words of this phrase in a monologue, returning them in the form of a mirror, confirming that we hear, listen and pay attention to what our opponent says.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:26.000
If we want, we can continue this phrase in our own way, starting with the words that we heard from the opponent, hearing from the partner in a conversation, making a logical transition to our speech from the phrase of the partner.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:44.000
We can also ask a clarifying question, clarifying something from what our opponent said, showing some detail, showing some aspect of the problem, clarifying some nuances of the topic that is being discussed in the negotiations.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Or we can ask a question for understanding, using a paraphrase, using a rephrasing of the question, using our interpretation of understanding of what our opponent is saying.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000
A paraphrase also helps us shift the focus of the conversation to the topic that is most beneficial to us.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:18.000
We can ask a question for understanding, proposing our interpretation, and having received confirmation from the opponent that such an interpretation is accepted by them, we can continue the conversation with a new understanding of the issue, continue it with a new focus on the topic.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Also, the active listening technique is a technique of summing up the results, when we sum up the intermediate result of what the partner said, as if concluding his speech, summing up everything they said and suggesting to agree on the understanding of this issue.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Summing up the result, we conclude the conversation so that it does not go in a circle, for example, we say, so we talked about this, about this and about this, the conclusion is this, we sum up the results, on this topic we have reached such an agreement or reached an agreement in such a position.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Another way to sum up the intermediate result is logical inference. In the case when we summed up the results, we addressed what was already said and summarized what we heard from our partner.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:16.000
In the case when we sum up the results, expressing logical inference, we take a step forward, we kind of assume what could have happened, what consequence could have come from what was said to our opponents.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:29.000
We offer our interpretation of the conclusion from what was said to the partners in the negotiations. Logical inference allows us to agree on the conclusions we have made and achieve an understanding from both sides of these conclusions.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The main thing that allows you to do active listening techniques is to have an initiative in negotiations in the case when we need to take over this initiative.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Using any of these techniques, we can easily switch to our speech, to our phrase, to the statements of our position, we can already start our own game in the negotiation process.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Another way to manage the negotiation process is the technique of working with objections. If we meet with objections about the words we say, about the arguments we offer to the opponent, we can use the technique of working with objections, consisting of four consecutive steps.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:23.000
First, we need to listen in detail and to the end what our partner says in his objection. We need to understand what the point is, what the hidden motive of our opponent is.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:44.000
People often object to the reasons that affect them emotionally, that are important to them. For us, the goal is to understand what our opponent meant by saying this objection, what worries, fears, doubts, and desires he has in this objection.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It is important to listen to the end to understand what is meant. And then ask a question using a paraphrase, to rephrase the objection in the key that is convenient for us to process it.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Ask a question for understanding, then express your acceptance, express understanding of the situation, understanding of such a point of view, understanding of the importance of this position, and then answer by providing arguments that prove and show that we also understand the importance of this proposal.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:38.000
We have information that the question that worries our opponent does not cause worry, we have evidence, facts, and arguments. In this case, we can use each objection to provide our own arguments, to move on to the next stage, to the stage of argumentation and defense of our position.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:55.000
As we have already said, each negotiation is carried out with the aim of achieving a specific result. Such a result is most likely an agreement between the parties on joint business, on supply, on cooperation, or on something else that is important for each party.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:12.000
An agreement is a product that is produced during negotiations. This is the goal that both parties strive for. Negotiations that ended without an agreement are negotiations that are carried out in vain. The parties have spent time, energy, and effort, but have not reached an agreement.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:35.000
How to complete negotiations with a result? How to get the product of negotiations? There are several simple techniques that allow you to achieve the result of any negotiations. First, we can, as soon as we feel that the main opinions have been expressed, the main positions have been voiced, offer, summarize, offer our interpretation of the results of the negotiations.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:10:00.000
In this case, a prepared phrase, a prepared template, a prepared project, a protocol on intentions, in which the position that we propose to adopt as a result of negotiations will be laid out, will help us. Of course, it can be corrected, it can be considered and changed. This is exactly the work on the arrival of the agreement that will be arranged by both parties.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Another way to achieve an agreement can be the Franklin method. Franklin is a person who is known for using the method of analysis for and against the situation. He studied what the situation says in order to make such a decision, and what contradicts it.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:41.000
You can offer your partner to analyze the situation using the Franklin method. You can literally write down the pros and cons, the arguments for and against the decision that you propose as a project of the agreement.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Another technique is when you assume that the agreement has already been reached, the agreement has already been reached, the agreement has been signed, and you can start asking questions about the situation as if the agreement had already been reached.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:11.000
In this case, you offer your partner to take a step back in order to achieve the agreement that was discussed in the negotiations.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Another technique is the completion of negotiations under the pressure of the time factor, when you can announce that the parties have some time left to reach an agreement. You have business to do, you have a plane, you have to be at a new meeting, and you have a few minutes left to reach an agreement.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:46.000
In this case, the work will go faster, and your partner will be more motivated to make a decision in a limited time. Of course, this decision should be taken into account the interests of each party.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The agreement is a product of negotiations. Always complete negotiations with an agreement on the next steps.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Today in our video lecture we will talk about a special type of business communication, business correspondence. The skills of effective communication are important in written speech, so today we will analyze several topics related to this.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:36.000
We will learn what business communications are associated with the modern activities of the company, what types of business letters are used in business correspondence, how commercial letters are designed, what the text of a commercial letter consists of. We will also consider some features and some requirements for the etiquette of business correspondence and the nuances that are important for the composition of e-mails sent by e-mail.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Each company exists in an environment that is important for it, because it is in this environment that its partners, contradictors, competitors and customers are located. These are people who use the services and goods of the company.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Various types of communication allow the company to achieve its goals, because it is by communicating, that is, by communicating, establishing connections, establishing relations, establishing contacts, that the company has the opportunity to promote its goods and services to the external environment, to protect its interests, to find new partners, to establish important commercial ties.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And in this regard, the type of communication called business correspondence is especially important, because it helps to set up the company's communication with the outside world as orderly and structurally as possible.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Business communications in the company are divided into two. These are external business communications, which are telephone conversations, business correspondence with contradictors, suppliers and customers, visits to the company and meetings outside the company, those meetings that are held by representatives of the company outside it.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Various publications in the press, interviews on television, activities of staff in public relations. There are also business communications that are closed inside the company, providing its activities to the internal environment. What are business communications?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:24.000
These are various official notes, telephone conversations between departments, working meetings at which plans are being drawn up and the promotion of these plans is being analyzed. Various information that is published inside corporate publications, whether printed or internal Internet resources.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And there may also be special events created by the company, such as conferences, meetings, meetings of employees of a certain direction, so that they can exchange experience and make plans for the future.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Business correspondence produced by the company for the external environment is also divided into several types. For what reasons, in what directions, in what cases does the company write business letters? Business letters can be a type of commercial letter, an offer for delivery, an offer for cooperation, an offer to establish partnerships.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It can be a letter of thanks, an answer to an invitation, an answer to an offer, an answer to a variety of invitations to cooperation. It can be congratulations, letters that the company sends to its best clients, partners, suppliers, those companies whose connections are important and the company values them, remembering their main dates, sending congratulations.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It can be a letter of thanks, an answer to an invitation, an answer to an offer, an answer to a variety of invitations to cooperation.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Letters can also be a type of apologies, when the company, answering a claim, answering a request, writes a letter to give an explanation, help understand the situation, apologize for the involuntary inconvenience.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:10.000
A letter of apologies is usually directed to the clients who send letters of complaints or to the partners who also express discontent with some aspects of the company's activities.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:32.000
A letter of apologies can also be a type of a request or a demand, when the company expresses discontent with a partner, a counteragent, a failure to fulfill obligations or a demand to fulfill them. In this case, a letter is a tough tool for influence on the opposing party so that the requirements are fulfilled and the obligations are met.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The most sad type of business letter is a letter of condolences. It is usually sent personally with a note, so that it reaches the addressee to whom the hands and eyes of the intermediaries in the transmission of this message were directed.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:21.000
A business letter, which functions and is located inside the corporate environment of the company, usually has a type of service notes. Service notes are also written for a variety of reasons and may concern, first of all, orders, for example, personnel issues regarding the reception at work, dismissals, termination of the probation period or transfer to another position with a raise or decrease.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:32.000
These can be service notes on personnel training, on the increase in qualifications of some category of employees or of a particular employee in particular.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Other types of service notes can be a variety of thanks and congratulations to those employees who retire, to those employees whose work experience in the company has reached a certain level, to employees whose anniversary is celebrated, a birthday, a birthday.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:23.000
A business note can also be a reminder, a request or a notification of the conduct of a corporate event. A variety of business reasons and questions regarding the company's activities may require a kind of written reminder that some things should be done, some events should be held, or simply an indication of the terms, place and time of the event.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:37.000
For writing business letters, one of two styles can be chosen. The choice of style depends on the reason and the topic of the business letter, what is it written for. The choice of one of the two possible styles depends on this.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:19:01.000
The choice of one of the two possible styles depends on this.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:29.000
The choice of one of the two possible styles depends on this.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:54.000
The informal style corresponds to the spoken language, the use of simple expressions, a lot of adverbs, a lot of adjectives, abbreviations are allowed, generally accepted, generally understandable. Special words can be used if the letter is addressed to a colleague in the field, a specialist of the same field, of the same industry. And this letter creates an atmosphere of subjective relations, personal relations, it is perceived as addressed from person to person.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:11.000
What are the general standards for writing business letters? Well, here is the standard applicable for writing regular letters. The main thing is that it is important to follow the mandatory rules that must be applied when writing business letters.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:36.000
First, the date of the letter must be set. Why is this important? Because in a commercial world, where the situation changes every second, the date of sending the message with certain information is important.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:21:05.000
The date of sending the letter must be set. Why is this important? Because in a commercial world, where the situation changes every second, the date of sending the message with certain information is important.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:27.000
The date of sending the letter must be set. Why is this important? Because in a commercial world, where the situation changes every second, the date of sending the message with certain information is important.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:22:04.000
The date of sending the letter must be set. Why is this important? Because in a commercial world, where the situation changes every second, the date of sending the message with certain information is important.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Typographic fonts are usually used in business letters, and various graphic fonts are not used, which have now been widely distributed in the creation of various graphic and illustrative materials.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Typographic fonts are usually used in business letters, and various graphic and illustrative materials.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Use the application format. Join the text of the letter to the application, and the table itself, the graphic and the photo, just apply a second sheet, apply as an addition to the application to the letter.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:06.000
There are several simple rules for writing business letters that will allow you to achieve full understanding and clarity from the recipient, from the addressee when he receives and reads the business letter.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:28.000
First, it is worth writing briefly and simply. Times of complexly composed turns and times difficult to pronounce phrases are now passing. Now you need clarity, clarity, so that there is no need for effort from the person who reads the letter, so that there is no need for excessive effort in understanding what kind of thought you wanted to convey to this business letter.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:50.000
It is advisable to use general words. Terms and special abbreviations are only permissible if you address a letter to a person who knows these words for sure, who will understand them for sure. This is your colleague at work, this is a specialist in the same industry in which you work, a person who knows a special language will be able to understand such a professional jargon.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:06.000
In the letter, you need to address a specific person, namely the one who is indicated to you by the addressee. Usually, the letter begins with this address. Dear Mr. This, dear director of the company.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:22.000
It is important that the letter has a personal character and the reader understands it, it is addressed to him, and all the thoughts that are expressed in it are thoughts that are addressed to his perception and understanding, require his reaction in response to the letter.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:40.000
If you want to convey a proposal in the letter, you can use the format you already know. First, draw attention, then arouse interest, then arouse desire, and at the end of the letter, stimulate the reaction to the response to the letter.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:25:09.000
You can draw attention by stating some circumstances of your case, arouse interest by proposing a solution to the task that is before you or your addressee, before your recipient, and then propose specific options, arousing a desire to join this solution, find some agreement options together, and at the end, stimulate the action by proposing specific actions that the recipient, the addressee could do in order to solve the task of the letter.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Another rule in writing business letters is to use simple speech turns so that your recipient clearly understands what kind of information is conveyed in your letter and you want to convey it to your addressee.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:51.000
How to build a business letter structure so that it is as clear and transparent as possible for reading? Of course, everything is built according to the same law of composition. First, we talk about the introduction. We talk about the introduction because it allows us to start a dialogue with our addressee, to start a dialogue with the recipient of the letter.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:08.000
The introduction usually includes the topic of the letter, preliminary acquaintance, preliminary review, a short summary of the concepts and the postulates that will be applied in the letter. The recipient immediately understands what the topic of the letter will be about and adjusts his perception of this topic.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:23.000
The introduction also contains a personal address, as we have already said, it should be a personal address to the person who receives the letter and will read it. The introduction also contains a reference to the last moment of your contact with the addressee.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:39.000
It is good if you indicate where you met, where you last talked, what served as a reason for your letter, what served as a bridge from which you came to write this business letter, what case, what event, what meeting.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:27:01.000
In the main part of the business letter, you submit the thoughts that you wanted to convey, formulating them separately, each new thought in a new paragraph. It is good if you follow the logical sequence, turn your thought from general to private and focus on the aspect that is the most important in your business letter.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:22.000
As soon as you have done this, there is a moment when you can move on to the conclusion and use the concluding phrases that will allow you to express your attitude to the recipient of the letter, verify it in your position and propose joint options for the outcome of your business letter.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:41.000
There are certain etiquette norms for business correspondence. What can and cannot be done in business letters, what is acceptable and what can cause irritation, disapproval, a negative reaction and prevent your addressee from correctly responding to the thoughts and words provided in your business letter.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:28:04.000
First, you should not encourage your addressee to make a decision in any way, using the words urgently, immediately, as quickly as possible. The urgency factor plays a good role in negotiations, in sales, when we encourage our opponent, our partner to make a decision or make a purchase.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:20.000
In a letter that is read by our recipient in a calm environment, this kind of urgency factor will most likely not play a decisive role, but will cause unwanted irritation and a negative reaction, which in this case will not help us achieve the goal of the business letter.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Secondly, it is not advisable to impose a decision on the addressee in any way, such as, for example, with the words, I ask you to study the issue and solve it positively. It is not necessary to tell the addressee which way and how to solve the issue.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:53.000
He will make a decision, he will decide for himself, it is his choice. All you can do in a business letter is to provide facts, arguments, your point of view and offer to consider, offer to make a decision as our addressee decides.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Thirdly, it is forbidden to hint at the addressee, at his alleged inattention or incompetence in the past, for example, using the words, I suggest you study it carefully. This suggests that we do not appreciate our business partner enough and we assume that he will consider very carefully.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:29.000
We make a special emphasis on the words, study carefully. It is enough to simply offer to study, consider, bring to the discussion the issues that we offer in a business letter, and what priority to assign to them, our addressee, our recipient, will be able to decide for himself.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:57.000
And fourthly, it is considered wrong to start a letter, for example, a reply to a claim, a reply to a request, a reply to a demand, with a direct statement of refusal of the request. In the beginning, it is still better to state your motivation, to state the reasons why you make such a decision, and then to make your verdict, so that your recipient, your addressee, understands what caused your refusal, understands the motivation.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:07.000
For him, this will soften the refusal itself and will allow him to treat your position with greater understanding, which will facilitate your long-term future relations.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:28.000
In addition to letters that are sent on paper, sent in envelopes, now, of course, letters sent by e-mail have received a large spread. The format is lighter, faster, does not require as much time as paper letters, but at the same time, the requirements for the registration of e-mails remained the same.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:55.000
If this is a corporate letter, if this is a letter from the organization, it must be, firstly, registered on the electronic form of the organization. There must be a special form that allows you to insert certain information into the desired fields. Date, addressee, sender, topic, and contain all the necessary company props. Logo, address, payment props, and so on.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:12.000
In this case, the letter has a complete, complete form, which indicates the status of the organization, what importance it gives to the image of its external environment, and how much it cares about the recipient, its partners, its addressees, to whom it sends letters in this form.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:24.000
An electronic letter must be filled with a field of topic. As you remember, the field of topic contains a brief description of the content of the letter, a brief summary of the terms and conditions that are provided in this letter.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:44.000
The letter must be signed with contact information. Your addressee, your recipient, should be able to contact you on the work issue stated in the letter, not only by e-mail, but also by phone, which you enter in the signature, enter in your contact information.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:32:09.000
In this case, if you want to attach any applications to the letter, if you have the opportunity and desire to send any file, it is important to agree with your addressee, with your recipient, the presence of such applications.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:38.000
The fifth requirement that is presented in the business letter should be sent from a corporate server, not from a free postman.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:59.000
This means that this company pays attention to its image and has all the opportunities to send its letters from a dedicated corporate server. Such a letter looks more solid, and the recipient understands that he received a letter from a partner worthy of respect, worthy of working with him further.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:19.000
These are the simple requirements presented in the electronic letters. So, dear colleagues, we have considered the tools for holding business negotiations, presentations and writing business letters. I am sure that the proposed tools will help you achieve your goals in your work. I wish you success and good luck in business.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Moscow Business School

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Manipulations

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:41.000
The first is the task that is solved during the meeting. If you have an answer to the question, why did you come to the general director today, then this stage is solved.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:35:02.000
The second is a formal process, on the basis of which a meeting is built. How does your meeting go? Is it a discussion, a dispute, a report of any of the participants in the meeting, or is it an analysis of the information that was received during the work of your company?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:23.000
The type of communication between the participants of the meeting. An effective type of communication is an effective interaction that helps your team to move towards a solution to a given task. Or a destructive type, in which a very active discussion takes place, but you understand that the task is still very far from being solved.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:34.000
The fourth is the result of the meeting. What do you get as a manager, what does your company get as a result of your joint work for a certain time?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:50.000
The task is solved during the meeting. What can be achieved with a meeting? The first is the motivation of the employees. Motivation or demotivation. Your employees came to you at the meeting, they communicate with you.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:09.000
How will you behave during this communication? How will they behave? You will get this result at the meeting. You can demotivate the employees at the meeting, you can shout at them, you can knock out all the activity and all the desire to work on your company.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Or you can, on the contrary, motivate them, you can show the importance of their work and the results of their work for the general promotion to the goal that your company is doing.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:38.000
The second task is the management of the team. It is at the meeting that all your subordinates become clear who occupies what place in the hierarchy of your team, whom you favor, and who is in the outsiders.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:45.000
The next task is the management of the processes. Management of the processes of interaction of subordinates within your team.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
The information collection.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:00.000
During the meeting, all the information that your subordinates have on all levels is summed up to one point. Each of your subordinates begins to have all the information.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:15.000
For example, the head of department A learns about the results of the work of the head of department B, and vice versa. Thus, participation in the meeting enriches each of your subordinates with information about the affairs of the company.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:24.000
So, the task is solved during the meeting. What can you achieve using such a tool of work as a meeting?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:35.000
First, you can collect information about the situation at a particular site of your company. The first task is the information collection.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
The second task is the analysis of this information.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
At the meeting, you can analyze how things are going at your company.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
The third task is to make a decision.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Using such a management tool as a meeting, you can work out and make a decision.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.000
You can solve some problem that arose at your company.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Why is it important to use a meeting for this purpose?

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Because you are not the only one participating in solving a problem that worries your team.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
The representatives of the circles that are affected by this problem also participate.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
The decision is made collectively.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And the assessment of the results of the work.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000
It is very important to understand where we are moving and at what stage we are now.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
These are the tasks that are intended to solve the meeting.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I repeat once again.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Information collection, information analysis, management decision-making, problem-solving, and assessment of the results of the activity.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
The purpose of the meeting.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
What goals can you achieve?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
The purpose of the meeting can be divided into two large blocks.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Constructive and destructive.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
The constructive goals serve the development of your company.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
This means that at the meeting you solve a problem.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
The absence of a solution that stops your company from developing.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Which slows you down, which absorbs or prevents you from making money.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And destructive goals.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
What is it?

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Destructive goals prevent your company from moving forward.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Achieving destructive goals is beneficial to some of the participants of the meeting, but not beneficial to your company as a whole.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
What destructive goals can be identified?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
First, clarifying personal relations.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Agree, it is important enough for some of the participants of the meeting to understand who is right in any issue.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And they can spend all their working time on solving their own issue.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000
However, solving this problem does not bring your company a centimeter closer to making another million dollars.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Again.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
The purpose of the meeting.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
First, clarifying personal relations.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
There may be a conflict in your team.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.000
And some of the participants of the conflict may want to clarify relations with another participant of the conflict.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Someone may want revenge for some inappropriate act.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Your task is to prevent such goals from being achieved at the meeting.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
This is work, and you achieve the goals that are beneficial to your company.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Second, satisfying personal ambitions.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Someone wants to show how important his personal work is for the whole team.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Perhaps, it is important to him, but does your company need it?

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Solving personal problems instead of team problems.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Someone of your participants has a headache today.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
He can do anything, only to stop having a headache.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Someone is very tired, and he wants to relax.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Perhaps, they will make a lot of effort to rest and find some medicine to solve their problems.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
But how will this promote your company to achieve its goals?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And the last type of destructive goal.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Conducting a meeting for a check mark.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.000
If you, as a leader, as an initiator of the meeting, are not interested in solving the problem,

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
it is better not to conduct a meeting.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Otherwise, you will only waste your time and your subordinates' time, and you will get very tired.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
So, a formal process, on the basis of which a meeting is built.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
The first option is a report.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
This form is familiar to almost everyone.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
One of the participants of the meeting tells in detail about the results of his work,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
or shares the information that he considers important on a particular issue.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
The second option is a discussion.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Discussing the importance of the information that the participant has told,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
discussing the points that other participants of the meeting are interested in,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
which seem important to them to solve the general problem.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And the next formal process is an analysis.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.000
An analysis of the provided information and a search for solutions to the current problems.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
The type of communication between the participants of the meeting.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
As already mentioned above, there are two types of communication.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Effective and ineffective.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Effective communication allows your team to work in a coordinated manner

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
and work on solving a common problem.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Ineffective communication is the type of communication

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
that leads to an active, vigorous discussion,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
but does not promote your group to solve a business problem.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
The conditions of effective communication.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
In order for your meeting to be effective,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
it is important that the communication between you and your subordinates

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
comes from certain roles, from the understanding that the meeting is a job,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
and at work we all play a certain role.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
The role is a requirement for behavior.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Below we will talk about the roles of the meeting,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
what roles the leader plays, what roles other participants of the meeting play.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Expressive or interrupted communication

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000
is based on emotions, on the emotional reactions of the participants of the meeting.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Something can capture you very much.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Either you or any of the participants of the meeting

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
want to achieve their own destructive goals.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
They want to achieve their own goals that are destructive.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000
This type of communication is characterized by assessments,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000
assessments of the correctness or incorrectness of the statements of other participants of the meeting.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
It is characterized by criticism, personalization and, perhaps, insults.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
You, as a leader, should make sure that your subordinates

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
do not switch to an expressive type of communication.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
The roles of the participants of the meeting.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Moderator, secretary, reporter and leader.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
The moderator monitors the compliance of the agenda.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000
The secretary helps the reporter.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
The reporter organizes the entire process of the meeting.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000
The reporter provides some information.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:10.000
The leader manages the meeting and makes the final decision on any issue.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
The result of the meeting.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
The first is the opinion of the participants of the meeting.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Opinions can be different.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
The first is the opinion of the participants of the meeting.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Remember how often you have a thought in your head.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Again, I wasted my time in vain.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Yes, perhaps, you should listen to the words of Ivan Petrovich.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000
This is an opinion.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
The second result is the action.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
After the meeting, you went to perform some task.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Or your subordinates went to perform some task.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
The third result is the action.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
The document.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
The document is the necessary result of the meeting.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Decision, order, report, something else.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And the managerial decision.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
That is, the decision that you make as a leader.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000
At the end of each meeting there are four results.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
They are in front of you.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Conditions of effectiveness of the meeting.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
These are some principles that each participant of the meeting should be familiar with.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
It is best to do this directly before the start of the process.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
The first. The meeting is a job.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.000
This means that each participant of the meeting should be active.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
The meeting is not a place to rest.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
The meeting is one of the forms of work.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Everyone gets paid for it.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
This means that no one will be able to sit aside.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000
In the decision of the issue, each participant of the meeting should take part.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
The second. The meeting has a goal.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:07.000
This principle means that the proposals of each member of the team should promote the team to achieve the goal.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Following this principle will help you get rid of destructive goals that are not important for your team.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
The third. The meeting is not a sport.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
There is no place for personal ambitions.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
There is no place for personal transition.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
There are no right and wrong.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
There is an opinion and the effectiveness of these opinions.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
There are tasks and decisions.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
And the effectiveness of these decisions for your team.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000
The fourth. The meeting is not a dispute.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:50.000
If you criticize, if a participant of the meeting criticizes some of the proposed solutions, he must propose his own alternative.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
If you criticize something, then propose your own solution.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
You can not criticize in general.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
The meeting is not a dispute.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:06.000
If the participants of the meeting follow these principles, you will always be able to achieve the result you think is necessary.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:14.000
So. Now we know that there is a certain structure, which allows effective meetings.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
What is the process of holding a meeting?

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
The process can be divided into 7 stages.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
You can see them now on the screen.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
The first stage. Preparation stage.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
What tasks are solved at the preparation stage?

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
First, determining the place and time of the meeting.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Second, determining the composition of the participants of the meeting.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Who of your employees is needed for the solution of any task?

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Third, determining the agenda.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
What tasks are relevant to you now?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
As a manager.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
What tasks are relevant to your company now?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
What tasks are relevant to your subordinates now?

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Next. Determining your personal relationship as a manager to the subject of the meeting.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
What do you want to achieve with the help of the meeting?

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
What is the goal personally in front of you?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:23.000
If you do not answer this question before the meeting, there is a possibility that at the meeting you will face something unexpected.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Therefore, before holding a meeting, it is important to understand what you personally want from this process.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:41.000
And the last task that is solved at the preparation stage is to inform the participants of the meeting that the meeting is taking place.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Information about the place, time and agenda.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Next stage.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
The stage of establishing contact.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
There are two components here.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
The formal and informal part.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
The informal part.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
What is the purpose of establishing contact?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
What is happening at this stage?

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Participants of the meeting meet.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Often they work in different departments and do not often see each other.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:20.000
This is an opportunity to talk, exchange news, shake hands, smile, just look.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
This part is from 1 to 3 minutes.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Usually it ends while all the participants of the meeting are in one room.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
And the formal part.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Here you can highlight the following.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Greetings, which is pronounced by the head of the meeting.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
The meeting's host.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Agreement of the regulations.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And the designation of roles.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
How does it happen?

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Today, Ivan Petrovich will tell us about the results of his work.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000
After that, we will listen to the report of Ivan Ivanovich on the state of affairs at the production site.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
What is this for?

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:09.000
This stage is necessary for your group to meet and start working.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000
When you start your car, the starter works first, which starts the engine.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
The stage of establishing contact is the starter of your meeting.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
The next stage is the manifestation of the situation.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
What is it?

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
This is the answer to a simple question.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
What are we going to talk about?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
There are three stages.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.000
The first is the definition of the subject of discussion.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
We often call the same things by different names.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And vice versa.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
We can call the same names different things.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
It is very important to develop a general system of concepts.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
What are we talking about now?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Definition of the subject of discussion.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:02.000
This can happen in a discussion or through acquaintance.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
You, as a leader, tell that we are now talking about...

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:13.000
You name the topic and explain what you mean by this word.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:21.000
It is important to expand the definition of the problem that you are declaring.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.000
The next stage is the definition of the attitude of each participant of your meeting.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Why each?

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
First, you can get information that you did not think about before.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Second, if at this stage one of the participants of the meeting is silent,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
does not express his attitude to the subject of discussion,

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000
it means that in the future he may not work on solving the problem,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
or return to this stage, stopping the work of the whole group.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Saying, you know, and I think differently.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
You know, and it is not worth attention at all.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Therefore, it is very important to understand how your working group relates to the task of the meeting.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Is this topic relevant to them or not?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000
And the last factor is the moderation of the process to the leaders.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
You, as a leader, are responsible for clearly determining the subject of the meeting

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.000
and understand how relevant this task is for the participants.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
After you establish contact with your group,

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
after the group established contact with each other,

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
with you, as the leader of the meeting,

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
the stage of choosing priorities comes.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
What is it?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
The answer to the question, what is more important to us,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
which of the items in the meeting is more important to us.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
This happens in two ways.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
The first is by voting.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
We vote which task is more important to us as a team at the moment,

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
or by the will of the leader.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
You decide as a leader what is more important to the team now.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
We will work with you on the solution of the task.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It is important to speak out the points of view of each participant when choosing a priority.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Firstly, this gives the opportunity to each participant to be heard.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And secondly, it gives the opportunity to the leader,

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
speaking out the point of view,

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
to understand more about the problem that is relevant to him.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.000
So, the culmination of the meeting is the stage of transferring problems into tasks.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000
You have gathered at this meeting to solve some problem,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
to increase the efficiency of your activity.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
What should be done for this?

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
For this problem, which has no solution,

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
you need to transfer it into a task,

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
which your team can solve.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000
For this you need to go through three stages.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
The first one is to answer the question,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
what is preventing us as a team,

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
what is preventing our company from being effective?

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
The second one is to understand what we want to be.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
What is the ideal situation?

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
What should be the ideal situation?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
What should our company be like?

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
How should we function?

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And the third, the most important,

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
what should we do to be like this?

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
When you find the answer to the question,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
what should we do,

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
your problem, which, as I said, has no solution,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
is transferred into a task,

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
which your team is able to solve.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
How to find the answer to these questions?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Very simple.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
With the help of brainstorming.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
The result of this stage is the product of the meeting.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
It is an order that describes the actions

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
that your employees should take

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
to solve a given task.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
So, your meeting is already in full swing.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
You have identified a relevant problem for your team.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Moreover, you were even able to transfer this problem

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
to the task that requires a solution.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
How to understand that your meeting is going in the path of efficiency?

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
To do this, look at what is happening.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
There are some signs.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
When is the meeting effective?

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
The meeting is effective if there is a discussion,

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000
if your participants are involved in the process,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
if you discuss the agenda,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
the questions that were put on the agenda.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000
The meeting is effective if the possibilities of solving the task are discussed.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Your participants say,

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
let's do it.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
They propose all kinds of solutions.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
The meeting is effective if specific proposals are made.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
One of the participants says,

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I propose and describe the actions.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I would like to propose,

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
and this phrase follows the description of a specific action.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Your meeting is already effective

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
if after 40 minutes after the meeting,

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
you were able to make at least one decision.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Any decision.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
For example, we finish in 20 minutes.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
The meeting lasts only an hour.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
If you were able to make at least one decision,

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
it means that your team can work.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
The meeting is ineffective if you observe the following situation.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
If one of your participants

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
allows himself to evaluate the personality of other participants.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Mary Ivanovna, you said nonsense.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Ivan Petrovich, you don't understand anything in the question you are talking about.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
If one of your participants allows himself to evaluate the personality of others,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
it means that the meeting is not effective.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
If your meeting is ineffective,

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
if you can observe a lot of negativity.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
No, it's impossible.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
No, it won't work.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
No, this task is unsolvable.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
If you hear the word no,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
you as a leader need to think what is happening.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Perhaps you have not yet identified the problem.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Perhaps your team is fighting to solve the problem.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Your meeting will not be effective

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
if your subordinates or you use a subjunctive.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
It would be possible if you describe any situation.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Yes, of course, everything can be solved

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
only if you describe any situation.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
If you use a subjunctive.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
If you use a subjunctive,

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
it is possible that the meeting will not be effective.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
If you use a subjunctive,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
it is possible that you will not solve the problem.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
If you hear that you often use a subjunctive,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
take a closer look.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Perhaps you are solving not a task, but a problem.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
You should also be warned

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000
if you hear that you often use a subjunctive.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Some of your participants most likely disagree

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
with the agenda or the general view of the team on the situation.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Then you need to return to the second point,

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
to the establishment of contact,

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
and clarify how relevant this situation is for your participants

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
and what they see it as.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
But all the problems are translated into tasks.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Your participants have proposed several solutions.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Now it is important to choose

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
which of them you take into account.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
The next stage is the meeting,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
decision-making and distribution of responsibility.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Agree?

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
In fact, these are two stages.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Decision-making and distribution of responsibility.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Why are they on the same slide?

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Only because a decision always carries a certain responsibility.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Responsibility of someone for something.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Therefore, when you hold a meeting and make a decision,

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
it is important to say at the same time

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
who is responsible for making a decision.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
How do you make a decision?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
We already know that there are two ways.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
The first is by voting.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
We are familiar with this method.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
So, what do you choose as a team?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Let's vote.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
The first option. Raise your hands.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000
The second option is a voluntary decision of the leader.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
You, as the leader of this team,

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000
as the leader of the meeting,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
decide that you choose the next path,

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
the solution of the task.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
That's it.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And the distribution of responsibility.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Two points.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
The first is to fix doubts.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And the second is to sum up the distribution of responsibilities

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
of the members of your team.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
What does it mean?

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Surely, some of your team members

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.000
doubt the effectiveness of certain decisions.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Perhaps you doubt yourself

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
and are not entirely sure that this decision

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
will ensure the achievement of the task 100%.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
It is important to talk about these doubts, these risks.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
If they are discussed,

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
they become clear to your team.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And then your team can put more effort

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
to achieve the goal.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
And the second is to sum up the results

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
with the determination of the responsibilities

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
for certain stages of work.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Your task is to summarize as a leader.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
So, we make a decision

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
to supply the product to the company N.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
This is responsible for

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Ivan Petrovich and Sergey Ivanovich.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Why is it important to sum up the results

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
and distribute the responsibilities?

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
This way you show that the meeting

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
and discussion of a certain issue are over.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.000
It's time to move on to action.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
We move on to the final stage of the meeting.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000
The meeting is over.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
At this stage, there are two components.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Formal and informal.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
The formal component of the meeting is

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
to sum up what you have stopped at,

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
what decision you have made,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000
and who is responsible for the execution of certain actions.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
You describe the actions

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
that your team members should take.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
The informal component of the meeting is

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.000
some actions that are taken by you,

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
which show to all your subordinates

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
that the discussion is over.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
The time of discussion of the task is over.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
All tasks are discussed.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
It's time to get to work.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
You can stand up,

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
you can turn off the projector,

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
you can say goodbye to everyone,

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
smile, change your tone.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
But the most important thing is

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
that your subordinates understand

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
that it's time to go to work.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
The meeting is over.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Well, we have considered the stages of the meeting.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I hope they are clear to you

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
and do not raise any questions.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
In any case,

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
when holding the next meeting,

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
prepare for it, try to observe

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
what happens during the meeting,

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.000
how preparation for the meeting takes place,

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000
how contact is established in the working group,

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
how you choose a task for a decision

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
that was collected in the meeting,

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000
how you make decisions,

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000
and how you finish the meeting.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Now we will move on to what can stop

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
or interfere with the leader

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
during the meeting.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
So, interference during a meeting.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
You can identify two types of interference.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
External and internal.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
External interference

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
is the absence of the necessary materials.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Someone, for some reason,

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
did not prepare the necessary conditions

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
for holding a meeting.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
The room is not prepared,

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
there are no transfer materials,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
not all participants are warned

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
that they are participating in the meeting.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
The decision to hold the meeting

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000
was made spontaneously.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
All this is the responsibility of the leader.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
It is he who is responsible

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
for taking the decision to hold the meeting

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
and controlling the work of his employees.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000
For example, the secretary,

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
who is responsible for preparing the room

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
and making the participants of the meeting

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
aware of the situation.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Next,

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
extraneous noise.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
There is a transport outside the window,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000
repair work is underway,

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
cell phones of the participants of the meeting

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000
are constantly ringing.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
You, as a leader,

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
need to make a remark to the participants of the meeting,

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
ask them to disconnect

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
their cell phones for a while.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Since the meeting, as we remember,

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
is a work.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
During this work,

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
you should not worry about anything else.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
And the need to interrupt the process.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Your secretary

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
apologizes to the participants of the meeting

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
and asks you to answer this false call.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
One of your colleagues

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
suddenly called,

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
he apologizes,

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
quietly leaves the room

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000
to discuss some important issue.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
I do not argue.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
The company's work should not be stopped,

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
but it is necessary to plan this process

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
so that during the meeting

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
no one distracts you.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
If you are distracted during the meeting,

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
you stop your work

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
and lose a lot of time.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
This leads to fatigue

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
and internal interference.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
The most interesting thing.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
The first is the mood of the leader.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Either excitement before the meeting,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000
or, what is much worse,

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.000
indifference to the result.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
The presence of a decision has already been made.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000
The meeting is held for a tick.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Remember, the destructive goal.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
If the decision has already been made

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
and the meeting is held for a tick,

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
then nothing but fatigue

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
and negative emotions

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
participants of the meeting

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
will not receive from this process.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
The next interference

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
that relates to the internal disorder

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000
is the presence of prejudices.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
The presence of prejudices

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
is the main problem

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
of the internal disorder.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
I know that the department of the service

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
will never offer a solution to this problem.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I know that Sergey Petrovich

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
will always argue

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
about the presence of prejudices.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
If you have any expectations

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
of a negative nature

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
about a particular participant of the meeting,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
most likely they will come true.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
And the last interference

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
that relates to the internal disorder

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
is the actions of the manipulator.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Conscious or unconscious.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Take the rule

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
that in any team

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
there is always a manipulator.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Conscious or unconscious.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
This is normal.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Your task as a manager

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
is to know how the energy of the manipulator,

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
his strength, his interest

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
can be used

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
to move to the solution

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
of the general task.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
What can the manager do

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
to reduce the influence of these factors?

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
So, what can the manager do

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
to reduce the influence

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
of external factors?

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
First, the most important thing

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
is to determine the agenda in advance

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
before the meeting begins.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
The questions that will be considered

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
at the meeting,

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.000
the time that will be allocated

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
at the meeting

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.000
and the composition of the participants.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Who will participate in the meeting?

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
The second thing is to determine

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
the place of the meeting in advance

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
and prepare it for the meeting.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Put, if necessary, flip charts,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
a projector,

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
if necessary, transfer materials.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Warn the participants of the meeting

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
that for some time

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
they will be inaccessible

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
to any external contacts.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Ask them

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
to warn their clients,

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
their subordinates

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
that for some time

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000
they should not be disturbed.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
And the last thing is to warn

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
your secretary

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
that for some time

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
you will be at the meeting

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
and you should not be disturbed.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
You are busy with an important work.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
This is how external interference is neutralized,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
as far as possible.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
And what to do with internal interference?

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Especially the most important

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
with the work of the manipulator.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
The answer to this question is very simple.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
You need to know

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
what manipulators are,

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
and know what to do with them.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
So, the types of manipulators.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
You can select three types of manipulators.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
They are called

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
victim,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
aggressor and savior.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
So, the type of manipulator

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
that is conventionally called a victim.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
This manipulator is inclined to parasitize

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
the actions of other participants of the group.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
The purpose of its manipulation

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
is to remove the victim

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
from the group.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
How does it achieve this?

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
The tactics of its actions are very simple.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.000
First,

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
describe your difficulties,

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
and in their exaggerated,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
catastrophic form.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Second,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
create emotional tension

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000
among the listeners.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
It describes its situation

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
in such a way

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
that everyone becomes clear.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
The person is in the situation

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
where he is in a situation

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
where he is not just in trouble,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
but a disaster has happened to him.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And the last one

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
is to express your demands.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
This is its goal.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000
When he has thickened

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.000
his emotional colors,

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
he begins to express his demands,

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000
what he needs.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000
And if you refuse

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
to fulfill his demands,

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
you will feel at least

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
very bad and bad person.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
This is the structure of this manipulation.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Why does it do this?

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Because manipulation

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
has benefits that the manipulator achieves.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
The victim achieves

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
in a possible way

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
without responsibility.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
It is possible to do everything she wants

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
without being held responsible

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
for the actions she has done.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
And the result of such actions

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
is usually negative.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Aggressor is a mirror reflection

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
of the type of victim manipulator.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Where the victim describes

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
his helplessness,

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
the aggressor demonstrates his strength.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Both of them.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
The benefits for himself.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Features of his behavior.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
This is personal uncompromising,

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
energy, uncompromising statements.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Or, if he understands

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
that such statements

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
can lead to negative consequences,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
intrigue.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
This type of manipulator

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
loves to weave all kinds of intrigues.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And the meeting, as we understand,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
because in the same space

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
are practically all the persons

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000
who make decisions.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
This is the best place

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
to conduct such intrigues.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
His goal

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
is to set his achievements

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
in the best light.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Usually due to the fact

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
that he belittles the achievements

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.000
of other participants.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
The tactics of his actions.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Description of mistakes.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Aggressive discrediting

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000
of those persons who were responsible

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
for the performance of certain actions

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
that led to the mistake.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Up to personal insults

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
and humiliation.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
And providing his vision

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
how to solve a particular situation,

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
which in this case

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
is perceived as the only possible.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Why does he do this?

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Well, as it was already said,

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
in order to set

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
in the most favorable light

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000
his decisions.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
The aggressor produces

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
the most powerful

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000
his decisions.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
The aggressor produces

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
personal conflicts.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
If you give the aggressor the will

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000
to express his claims,

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
it means that after a while

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
in your team

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000
revenge,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
sclock

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000
and all kinds of intrigues will begin.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
And the next type of manipulator

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
is the savior.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Features.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
All his actions

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
have a recommendatory nature.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000
When there is no problem,

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
he appears where there is a problem,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
where someone needs to be saved,

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
where there is a victim.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Usually the savior is very active

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
responds to the cry of the victim for help.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000
And as a result,

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000
if you allow him to respond

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
to the cry of the victim,

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
your working group decides

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
very passionately,

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
because the savior can do it,

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.000
very passionately solves the problem

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
of one member of your team.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
And you will not forget

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
about the agenda of the day

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
for which you gathered at the meeting.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
The goal of the savior

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.000
is to get for himself

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
material and moral benefits.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Material benefits,

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
any bonuses,

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
monetary rewards.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
And the moral work of the savior,

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
the salvation of the victim

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000
gives him the opportunity

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
to feel good,

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
right,

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000
strong.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
The first is waiting.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Until the victim has shown up,

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
the savior is also sitting quietly

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
and does not solve the task

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.000
that is put before him.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000
However, as soon as the victim

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.000
with her difficulty,

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000
with some problem,

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.000
he immediately rushes to help

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
and offers his own options for a solution.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Since the victim describes

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
very terrible consequences

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000
in which she got,

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
the options of the solution

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000
that the savior offers

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
require a lot of effort.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
And for this, he is ready to provide

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
the opportunities to your entire team.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
As a result, as I said,

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000
if the savior takes up the case,

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
your entire team

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
solves the problem of the victim.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.000
In this regard,

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
the actions of the aggressor manipulator

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000
look much more harmless

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
than the actions of the victim-savior tandem.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:06.000
What can the leader do

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000
to interrupt

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
the actions of the manipulator?

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
In fact, not so much.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
He can only ask a question.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
But this is usually enough.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Since manipulations

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000
usually have an unconscious nature.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Yes?

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Well,

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
quite rarely in your team

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000
there is a person

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
who purposefully strives

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
to harm the work of the team.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Usually such manipulations

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.000
have an unconscious nature.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
In order to return your team

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000
to the discussion of the agenda,

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
you just need to ask

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000
special questions.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
So, the types of questions

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
that return the discussion

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
to the constructive course.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000
The first question

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000
that returns the responsibility

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
of the manipulator

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
to the leader

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
is the question

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
of the manipulator

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.000
to himself.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
You remember,

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
the main goal of the manipulator

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
is to transfer the responsibility

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
for his actions to another.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
The question is

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
what does your problem

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
have to do with the agenda?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
The manipulator

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
needs to think about

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
and answer this question.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
How will the solution to this problem

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
affect the overall result?

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Indeed,

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000
the manipulator

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
has already thought about it.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
He has also thought about

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
the topic that you need.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
The question that

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
returns the rescue team

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
to the constructive discussion

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.000
of the problem is

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
what are you personally ready

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.000
or able to do

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
to solve this problem?

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Usually, then the rescue team

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
understands that there are

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
enough resources

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000
to solve the problem

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
and that there are

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.000
enough ways to solve the problem.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
And the wonderful question

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000
that returns

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
the constructive discussion

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
of any manipulator

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
or erases the fantasy

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
that has nothing to do

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:16.000
with the reality.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Do you have specific proposals

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
to solve this problem?

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.000
So, using these

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000
and similar questions

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
will help you to return

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
the members of the working group

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000
to the constructive discussion

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000
of the problem.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
So, our meeting

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
has come to an end.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
How to understand

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
that the meeting was effective?

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
How to understand

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000
what you personally received

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
after this meeting?

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
It is enough to ask yourself

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
a few questions.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
The first question is

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
how my point of view

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000
has changed after the meeting?

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Has it changed?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
What should I do?

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Does your subordinate know

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
what he has to do

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
after the meeting?

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Are tasks defined for him?

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Who do I help

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
and who helps me?

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000
If your subordinate

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000
or you can answer these questions,

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
then you understand

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000
what the result of your activity

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000
means for the team.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
How will the result

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.000
of my work be evaluated?

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
On what basis

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
will I be able to work?

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.000
This question is very important.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
If you cannot answer it,

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000
then no activity is possible.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000
And the last type of questions

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000
is when I should start working

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
and when I should finish.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000
If you do not have an answer

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
to this question,

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000
it means that your meeting

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.000
has unfortunately gone to waste again.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:52.000
If your subordinate

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000
or you can answer this question,

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
it means that you made

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
the right management decision

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.000
and it was useful.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.000
How to conduct an effective meeting

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
and not be manipulated by your subordinates?

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:06.000
So, we have finished the topic

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000
of how to conduct an effective meeting

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000
and not be manipulated by your subordinates.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
You have noticed

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000
that this is a small topic,

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000
but it is very important for the head.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I hope that the information

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000
that I have provided you

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
during our seminar

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
will help you to effectively

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
solve the problem.
