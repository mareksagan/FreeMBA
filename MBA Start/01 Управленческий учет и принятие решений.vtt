00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The management decisions

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, colleagues.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Today we will talk about a very interesting topic for you,

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
which you probably face in the process of your practical activity.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
This is the adoption of management decisions based on the principles and methods of management accounting.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
First, I will introduce myself.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
I am Skalkin Vladimir Vladimirovich, a candidate for Economics.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
I also have a certificate of a financial manager from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology,

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
Calgary, Canada, where I worked, taught and provided consulting services.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Now I work as the head of the Moscow University of Tours,

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
an American university that provides American education.

00:57.000 --> 01:08.000
I have also had to carry out various projects and work as a consultant in well-known companies such as Luke Oil and Gazprom.

01:09.000 --> 01:24.000
I also have been in charge of accounting for a number of companies related to the cosmetics industry and the construction industry.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
I would like to say a few words about what we will be talking about today.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
You are familiar with accounting, of course.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Many people think that accounting is necessary only to pay taxes.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
But this is a rather one-sided view and a very small part of accounting.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Another part of it, which is more well-known, is financial accounting,

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
which provides the necessary accountability for companies to be able to go to the stock exchange,

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
to issue shares, the so-called IPO, which is now in great fashion,

02:10.000 --> 02:21.000
and also to be able to report to their foreign partners and the public,

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
who are interested in how much the shares of these companies are being sold and are going to make investment decisions.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
But there is also a third type of accounting, which is not used so often,

02:35.000 --> 02:45.000
because there are no requirements that really force companies to use accounting.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
It is accounting.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
It is not required by the tax authorities, it is not required by the Commission on Valuable Papers and Stock Exchanges.

02:56.000 --> 03:09.000
Nevertheless, those companies that realized that management decisions should be applied only based on specific information,

03:09.000 --> 03:18.000
have a much greater advantage in their activities and more competitive advantage in their markets.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
This will be the main topic of our lesson today.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Our video lecture will consist of the following sections.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
This is the concept of management analysis.

03:33.000 --> 03:43.000
Next, we will talk about the things like the traceability of costs and what costs are in production and in trading,

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
and how to deal with them, how to take them into account and how to track them for decision-making.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
Next, a very interesting topic is the analysis of the profitability of production,

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
that is, the determination of the point from which a company can successfully sell its products and make a profit.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
Next, of course, the assortment of products and the planning of the assortment of products will also be the subject of our consideration.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
After that, we will move on to the analysis of some decision-making on pricing.

04:25.000 --> 04:36.000
And then we will move on to the concept of regulatory costs and the standard cost system.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
And we will finish with the theoretical foundations of the Direct Costing system.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Management Analysis

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
So, management analysis. What is management analysis?

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
Any manager makes decisions during his or her activities.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
These decisions can be based on various factors.

05:07.000 --> 05:23.000
These decisions can be based on emotions, intuition, on someone's order, a wish, on a tradition.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
All these types of decisions are present in business, and you all know about it very well.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
But among all types of decisions, there is only one type of decision that is considered reasonable and rational.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
These decisions are based on accurate information that the management system gives.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
This is exactly what is necessary for every modern company today.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
And it is necessary for the decisions to be exactly as they should be.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
These decisions should be based on information.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
These are rational and reasonable decisions.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Management analysis allows companies to focus on their core competencies.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
What are these core competencies?

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
These are the things that companies can do better than others.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
The things that other companies cannot do better than them.

06:23.000 --> 06:32.000
At the same time, companies cannot do what other companies can do.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
This is also very important.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
Because the price of opportunities lies at the core of all decisions and assessments.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
If we do something, we give up some alternatives.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
This means that we do not do something else.

06:53.000 --> 07:01.000
Any thing should always be compared to what we could do instead.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
So, what does the company put all its efforts on?

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
What gives the company an advantage over its competitors?

07:11.000 --> 07:21.000
For example, the main competencies of Sony are design and manufacture of electronic devices for consumers.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
These devices are smaller in size and better in quality.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Can Sony do something else?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Can Sony melt metal?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Of course, it can.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
But what will be the price?

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
The price will be that Sony will not make electronic devices.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
What should Sony do if it needs to focus on its core competencies?

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
For this, companies need to do what is now called outsourcing.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
This means that the functions that a company can give to other companies,

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
the functions that can be performed much better and cheaper by other companies,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
should not be performed.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
It is better to specialize in what you can do best.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
So, outsourcing is the attraction of third parties or other companies to perform the work

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
that is necessary to carry out the process or service of the function

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
that is not part of the company's core competencies.

08:35.000 --> 08:43.000
For example, the core competencies of Nike are design and marketing of sports shoes.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
The company does not make the shoes itself,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
but attracts third parties to make the work,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
by contacting the company that specializes in the production of shoes.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
We know that Nike is active in a lot of countries around the world.

09:00.000 --> 09:10.000
Recently, Nike has moved production to countries with cheaper labor.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
For example, it is already widely known that Nike has its own enterprises in Vietnam,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
where labor prices are cheaper than in China.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
This allows Nike to maintain the quality of production,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
to maintain the design and, at the same time,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
to use the advantages of international labor division

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
and to market its production in countries where labor is much cheaper

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
and where production is much cheaper and there are fewer other problems,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
including with local governments.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
Let's look at an example at a specific factory,

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
at a specific company that allows you to determine

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
how to carry out the activity,

10:06.000 --> 10:15.000
what to do and what is best to pass on to other companies as outsourcing.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
We will use the example of a company.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
This company is fictional,

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
and the people mentioned in this example, as well as in other examples, do not exist.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
If there are any coincidences, they can be accidental.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
So, we use such a fictional example.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
Evgeny Stibelsky is the owner of a chocolate company named after him.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
He is interested in knowing,

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
he is interested in the exact information about the cost of chocolate he produces

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
and he must determine whether the production and sale of his own brand of chocolate will be profitable

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
and whether they will remain competitive.

11:08.000 --> 11:19.000
He can design the design, structure, recipe of this product,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
he can produce it,

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
and he can sell the chocolate to a factory that has more competence

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
and can do it much more cheaply.

11:37.000 --> 11:46.000
So, Evgeny sells chocolate for 1000 rubles per kilogram.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Of course, the numbers are approximate,

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
they are not related to the current situation.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
You know, the numbers can change, the prices can change.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
That's why we use the conditional units.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
If you know that the prices for this product are at the same level as for other products,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
don't think about it.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
The number 1000 is convenient for calculation.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
That's the only reason why we use this number.

12:21.000 --> 12:30.000
So, Evgeny has an idea about how much chocolate he can sell during the first year of the company.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
He gives the task to his accountant, Sergey Chezov,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
to analyze the whole chain of creation of cost

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
and design initial costs per kilogram of product.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
So, what did the chief accountant give us?

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Let's look at the following table.

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
These are the estimated costs of making the exclusive chocolate of a new variety, Umka.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
The table consists of three columns.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
The first column considers the stages of the production process.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
The second column considers the initial cost per kilogram

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
and the second column considers the revised cost.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
That is, the cost we can get if we carry out the required measures.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
So, the stages of the production process.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Research and development.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
The chocolate will cost 25 rubles per kilogram in both cases.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Design work will cost 10 rubles.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Supply will cost 110 rubles.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
But in case of revision of the strategy, it will cost only 60 rubles.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
Production will be saved from 450 rubles to 350 rubles.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Marketing will be the same, 50 rubles per kilogram.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
Distribution and service will be the same, 90 rubles and 65 rubles.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
So, the cost in the initial variant per kilogram will be 800 rubles.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
The revised cost after the necessary measures will be 650 rubles.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
That is, we save 150 rubles.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
Of course, the head of the company, Stibelsky, is interested in reducing the initial cost,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
which is now 800 rubles.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
What does 800 rubles per kilogram mean?

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
It means that only 200 rubles per kilogram remains to cover all services

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
for the production of the product and to get the profit.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
This difference is the margin, which is 20% of the income.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
That is, if we take the price of the product,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
calculate the cost, divide it by the price,

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
1000 rubles minus 800 rubles divided by 1000 rubles

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
will be 200 divided by 1000, 20%.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Is this a lot?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
Evgeny thinks it's not a lot, so something needs to be done.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
What does Evgeny think?

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
The margin should be at least 35% for the enterprise to be successful.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Can we increase the price?

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Yes, we can think about it, but the starting price is limited by competition.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
Therefore, the only way for Evgeny is to find a way to reduce the costs.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
What does the chief accountant tell him?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Sergey.

15:54.000 --> 16:01.000
Sergey says that the highest costs in the chain of production cost

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
are the costs for the production and supply,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
which are related to the production itself.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
What are the ways to reduce the cost per kilogram?

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
The first way is to sell higher volumes.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
This product, chocolate.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Is this realistic?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
No, it's not realistic.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
The next way is to reduce the costs.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Using a single supplier.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Evgeny planned to order materials from many suppliers,

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
but the orders will not be large enough to get discounts for the volume.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
The savings on discounts for the volume is equal to 50 rubles per kilogram.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
This is not the biggest advantage that can be used.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
The third way is outsourcing.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
The company attracts third parties to work on the production of chocolate.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
A chocolate manufacturer with a large volume of products

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
can produce a product at a much lower cost

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
than the one that could be made at the factory.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
The production cost will be 350 rubles per kilogram

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
versus 450 rubles per kilogram,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
if it is produced for 100 rubles,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
which is the savings from outsourcing production per kilogram.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
That is, 450 rubles minus 350 rubles.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
This cost savings would allow the company to sell its chocolate

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
at a competitive price of 10 rubles and get a 35% discount.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
The calculation.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
The initial cost for 1 kilogram is 800 rubles.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
The cost of changing the cost of using one supplier is 50 rubles.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
The cost of reducing the cost of outsourcing production is 100 rubles.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
The total cost of outsourcing production is 650 rubles.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Now we are calculating the new margin.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
The new margin will be 1000 rubles minus 650 rubles divided by 1000 rubles,

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
which is 0.35 or 35%.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Conclusions.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Two important conclusions are illustrated by this analysis.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
First, the mission of the enterprise.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
The enterprise, as a retail seller,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
has no production experience in the production of chocolate.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
The company should change its mission

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
and make the main changes in the way it does business.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Often, this is the best policy,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
which is to attract third parties to perform the work

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
of creating a cost chain,

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
which is not a part of the company's main competence.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Since the company does not have the main competence in the production of chocolate,

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
it would not be competitive enough to continue working in this area.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
Now we will move on to the second part of our lecture,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
which is the traceability of costs.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
We have already considered the example of what information is needed

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
to make management decisions.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
We have considered the example of reducing costs

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
in two ways,

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
by attaching to a single supplier and by outsourcing.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
But this is just the beginning of what we have to study.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
In order to study the information

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
necessary for making management decisions in more detail,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
it is necessary to consider the essence of costs.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
Yes, in our activities, we all face various costs.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
These costs are in our personal lives,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
in production and in trade.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
We all live around costs.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
But is it enough to understand their essence?

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Is it enough to classify them

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
so that based on the various classifications and the essence of costs,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
we can make the necessary decisions?

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Managers track costs on the cost objects

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
to achieve a fairly accurate measurement of costs.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Cost objects include products or services.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
That is, we can, by producing a number of products,

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
focus on the costs and take into account the costs of each of these products.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
That is, if we have five types of cars that we produce,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
we can allocate costs for each of these cars.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
If we provide services, for example, medical services,

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
and we carry out five types of various medical services,

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
then we can allocate costs for each of these types.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
The next type of cost object is the sales area.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
For example, a company sells goods in Moscow,

21:51.000 --> 22:01.000
St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Krasnodar, Kiev, Minsk, and other cities.

22:01.000 --> 22:10.000
Each of these cities can be classified as a cost.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
All costs associated with each of the cities will be considered a cost object.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
The next type of cost classification includes departments or units of the organization.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
What does this mean?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
The organization has several departments.

22:28.000 --> 22:35.000
Production department, sales department, shopping department, marketing department,

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
personnel management department, finance department, accounting department.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Each of these departments can be classified as a cost,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
and each of these departments will be a cost object.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
And operational activities.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
A company can carry out several types of activities.

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
For example, a bank can support citizens' deposits,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
that is, the so-called retail.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
A bank can also engage in investment activities,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
can serve corporate clients,

23:14.000 --> 23:22.000
can carry out various procedures related to the maintenance of trust operations.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
All of these types of activities can also be a cost object.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Next, we will look at direct and indirect cost measures.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Direct and indirect.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
What does this mean?

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
Direct costs are costs that directly relate to the cost object.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
At the same time, indirect costs cannot directly relate to the cost object.

23:45.000 --> 23:55.000
For example, direct costs are labor costs to manufacture a nut in production.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Labor costs are direct costs.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
But, for example, the amortization of equipment for the manufacture of the same nut is a direct cost.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
A direct cost.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
These direct and indirect cost measures are used to support price decisions,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
that is, decisions on price determination,

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
as well as decisions on redistribution of resources to other cost objects.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
That is, we either have to distribute resources, or we have to work with prices.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
What are direct costs?

24:31.000 --> 24:39.000
Direct costs are costs that can be conveniently and economically traced to the cost object.

24:39.000 --> 24:45.000
For example, the cost object is the flight of the air fleet.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
That is, the flight of the air fleet takes off with passengers,

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
and we consider this flight as a cost object.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
One single, separate flight.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
What are the direct costs in this flight?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Crew salary.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Crew salary is based on the time spent and tariff estimates,

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
which are shown on the work time and payment details.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Fuel costs.

25:21.000 --> 25:29.000
Yes, we can say exactly how much the crew will be paid for one flight.

25:29.000 --> 25:38.000
We can also say exactly how much fuel one flight of the aircraft will consume.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
What are indirect costs?

25:40.000 --> 25:47.000
Indirect costs are costs that cannot be conveniently and economically traced to the cost object.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Examples.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Nails used to assemble furniture.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
Salt used to make cookies.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Rivets used in airplanes.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Also, indirect costs may be aircraft suspension.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
These costs must be included in the costs for the product and service.

26:11.000 --> 26:20.000
To be precise, so that we can say exactly how much each action we carry out costs.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
How much does each flight of the aircraft cost?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
How much does each pack of cookies cost?

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
How much does each made wardrobe or chair cost?

26:32.000 --> 26:40.000
These indirect costs are also related to the cost of a certain developed formula.

26:40.000 --> 26:49.000
We will talk later how this can be done, because a lot depends on how we distribute these costs.

26:49.000 --> 27:04.000
Knowledge of how these costs are distributed will allow us to make decisions and take into account everything we do.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
And to carry out our activities more effectively.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
So, costs for the insurance of the air fleet.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
A portion of the costs is related to the cost of each flight.

27:15.000 --> 27:24.000
For example, we have made insurance costs that are carried out once a year.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
But how many flights does each aircraft carry out during the year?

27:29.000 --> 27:40.000
We must now take the costs carried out completely during the year and divide them by the number of flights.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
By the number of flights.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
A portion of the costs is related to the cost of each flight.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
Let's look at a number of other examples of the cost of the insurance.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Service organization.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Costs.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
Preparation of the tax report.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
This is a fairly common procedure.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
What are the direct costs and what are the indirect costs?

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
Direct costs to prepare the tax report.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
What is needed?

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
Paper, computer and the work of an accountant.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
All these costs can be directly attributed to the preparation of the report.

28:28.000 --> 28:36.000
For example, it is clear how much paper is needed to print and prepare the tax report.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
The computer also takes a certain amount of time.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
And we can say how much time the computer takes.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
The work of an accountant.

28:47.000 --> 28:57.000
The accountant spends a certain amount of time and we can accurately estimate how much time the accountant will spend to prepare the tax report.

28:57.000 --> 29:06.000
But there are also indirect costs that cannot be directly attributed to the tax report.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
These are the consumables.

29:09.000 --> 29:18.000
Of course, we can attribute how many cartridges will be used, how many pencils, pens.

29:18.000 --> 29:26.000
But no one will count these pens, pencils, cartridges and other consumables.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Because there is no point in doing this.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Next, the rent of the office.

29:31.000 --> 29:41.000
The rent of the office will not be calculated separately for each separate report or separate document.

29:42.000 --> 29:57.000
The utility services, the payment of utilities, electricity, heating, water and other services will not be attributed separately to each tax report.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Just like the amortization of office furniture.

30:00.000 --> 30:15.000
All these expenses have no sense to be attributed to each separately produced product, whether it is a tax report or a car for the automotive industry.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
The organization of retail trade.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
What types of costs are there?

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
The cost of shoes.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Direct costs.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
The cost of shoes and the salary of the workers in the shoe department.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
We can say exactly how much it is necessary to spend to buy shoes for sale.

30:41.000 --> 30:49.000
And we know exactly how much salary will be paid to the workers who work in this department.

30:49.000 --> 31:06.000
But indirect costs such as insurance, utility services, taxes, shoe storage, goods care will not be considered separately for each separately produced product.

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
That is what separates indirect costs from direct costs.

31:14.000 --> 31:24.000
In a production organization, the cost of production is the direct costs.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
These are costs for labor and materials.

31:27.000 --> 31:36.000
In order to produce a product, several consecutive operations are needed.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
Each operation requires labor and materials.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
We can say exactly how much labor and materials are needed for each production.

31:48.000 --> 32:01.000
How much labor is needed to assemble a car, to assemble all the parts that are included in its composition, to fit and to fix it.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
We can also say how much material costs are.

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
But there are indirect costs that are used when making the same cars.

32:11.000 --> 32:26.000
That is utility services, amortization of equipment and machines, insurance, taxes, effort to control the quality, management, maintenance and operation of equipment, storage and handling of materials.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
All of this is indirect costs.

32:30.000 --> 32:36.000
We have learned that direct costs can be direct and indirect.

32:36.000 --> 32:43.000
Direct costs are costs that can be directly attributed to the cost of the product.

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
Indirect costs are costs that can be attributed but are not necessary.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
Therefore, they are never attributed to the cost of the product.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
There is no point in doing this.

32:57.000 --> 33:07.000
Efforts to attribute these costs to the cost of the product will not cost the economy that we will get from what we have done.

33:07.000 --> 33:32.000
Let's move on to a very interesting and necessary topic related to decision-making.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
This is the analysis of production profitability.

33:35.000 --> 33:46.000
The task is to determine the concept of the dynamics of costs and explain how the manager uses this concept in the management cycle.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
Here we introduce a new term, the dynamics of costs.

33:51.000 --> 34:02.000
That is, not just how the costs are divided, but how they change with the change in the volume of production and the volume of sales.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
The dynamics of costs are very important.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
The dynamics of costs are an important factor in decision-making.

34:10.000 --> 34:19.000
The dynamics of costs are used in the analysis of alternatives and in decision-making.

34:19.000 --> 34:28.000
The best decision will bring more profits for the business owner, better liquidity for creditors.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
So, what is the dynamics of costs?

34:41.000 --> 34:51.000
The answer is that the dynamics of costs are how the costs change with the change in the volume of production.

34:52.000 --> 35:00.000
Now that we know what the dynamics of costs are, how they change with the change in the volume of production and sales,

35:00.000 --> 35:11.000
let's define the variable, constant, mixed costs and divide the mixed costs into their constant variable components.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
How can we observe the dynamics of costs?

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
It is always related to the production of products and services.

35:19.000 --> 35:25.000
It manifests itself in commercial, administrative and general economic activities.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
If managers can predict the dynamics of costs, the costs become manageable.

35:33.000 --> 35:44.000
There is an old story, a legend, where this idea came from, the idea of analyzing the dynamics of costs.

35:44.000 --> 35:52.000
It was once believed that if you start your business, you need to get support from a banker.

35:53.000 --> 36:10.000
It used to be done by inviting a banker to a restaurant and explaining how the business would work and why the banker should give money for the development of the business.

36:11.000 --> 36:25.000
So, at the most important moment, you need to explain in three simple words why this business will pay itself.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
What is at hand?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Nothing.

36:29.000 --> 36:39.000
The restaurant's table, the tablecloth, the food, and a box of napkins.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
You take a napkin and make a business plan on it.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
How many napkins can you put on it?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Only three numbers.

36:51.000 --> 36:59.000
Three numbers are variable costs, constant costs, and the number of products.

36:59.000 --> 37:11.000
Using these three numbers, you can convince a banker to give money for the development of the business.

37:11.000 --> 37:20.000
Of course, it is more like a legend, a fairy tale, but there is a lot of rationality in it.

37:20.000 --> 37:33.000
That's why we use this theory, which is almost a joke, but at the same time it has a lot of meaning and application.

37:33.000 --> 37:54.000
A modern manager needs to have an idea of what are the constant variable costs, because only then can you determine when the business will pay itself and whether it will pay itself at all.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
So, let's make a definition.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
Variable costs are those that change with the change of production volume.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
Constant costs remain constant with the change of production volume.

38:09.000 --> 38:17.000
That is, no matter how much we produce and sell, the costs will be the same.

38:17.000 --> 38:24.000
Variable costs will change. We sell little, we produce little, the costs are small.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
We increase the volume of production and sales, the costs increase.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
This division always gives us the opportunity to make decisions.

38:36.000 --> 38:44.000
Mixed costs are those that show characteristics of both constant and variable costs.

38:45.000 --> 38:55.000
Variable costs are costs that change with the change of production volume or other activity.

38:55.000 --> 39:08.000
That is, one product is 1 ruble, two products are 2 rubles, three products are 3 rubles.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
This is an example of a direct proportional change in costs.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Let's look at the table.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
How do variable costs change?

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
That is, the dynamics of variable costs.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
In this table we see three columns.

39:25.000 --> 39:33.000
The number of produced cars, the total cost of cars and the cost of cars per 1 car in rubles.

39:33.000 --> 39:40.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the prices do not correspond to the real prices that we can observe on the market.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Prices are given conditionally.

39:42.000 --> 39:50.000
For one car, the cost of tires per 1 car is 1920 rubles.

39:50.000 --> 39:57.000
The total cost of tires per 1 car is 1920 rubles.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Why?

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
The cost of tires per 1 car is multiplied by the number of produced cars.

40:05.000 --> 40:13.000
Next, if we have two cars, we must multiply the number 1920 by 2.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
We get 3840.

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
Next, we multiply by 3, 4, 5, depending on how many cars we have produced.

40:24.000 --> 40:33.000
And for 10 cars, this number will correspond to 19200.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
Thus, we see how variable costs change.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
They are directly proportional to the number of produced cars.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
In this diagram, we see how this is illustrated.

40:48.000 --> 40:56.000
That is, variable costs per unit of production are constant.

40:56.000 --> 41:03.000
The cost of tires per 1 car will be a constant value.

41:03.000 --> 41:14.000
And the total cost of tires is a variable cost, since it changes directly proportional to the number of produced cars.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Now let's look at constant costs.

41:17.000 --> 41:26.000
These are costs that remain unchanged within the range of predictability of the production volume or other activity.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
To do this, we must define the concept of the range of predictability.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
What is it?

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
This is the size of the production in which a large-scale base is used to calculate constant costs,

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
and most likely will be carried out in the current production plan.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
Naturally, the dynamics of constant costs are different from the dynamics of variable costs.

41:52.000 --> 42:03.000
According to the economic theory, all costs are variable in the long term.

42:04.000 --> 42:12.000
If we recall the economic theory, we know that there is a short-term approach,

42:12.000 --> 42:21.000
when the number of costs is related to the number of produced products, and a long-term approach.

42:21.000 --> 42:28.000
That is, we need to increase the number of enterprises in order to produce more products.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
To build one enterprise, you need to spend several years,

42:33.000 --> 42:43.000
but every time the number of enterprises increases, so-called constant costs also increase.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
That is, in the long term, any costs are variable.

42:47.000 --> 42:57.000
All costs are variable, since all prices change, salaries change, prices for materials, services, everything changes.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
That is, in the long term, all costs are variable.

43:01.000 --> 43:13.000
Nevertheless, in the short term, we can divide the costs that are variable from the costs that are constant.

43:13.000 --> 43:20.000
Therefore, costs can be constant or fixed only in a limited period.

43:20.000 --> 43:26.000
That is, for the purpose of management, this is usually not more than one year.

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
And during this one year, it is assumed that constant costs will be unchanged.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
An example of constant costs.

43:37.000 --> 43:45.000
A cannery manufacturer needs one master of change for an eight-hour shift.

43:45.000 --> 43:53.000
The volume of production can vary from 0 to 500,000 cans per month per shift.

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
The salary of the master of change is 40,000 rubles per month.

43:58.000 --> 44:05.000
Again, I remind you that all prices and figures are conditional and are only given as an example.

44:05.000 --> 44:14.000
So, the range of production volume can vary from 0 to 500,000 cans.

44:15.000 --> 44:29.000
If we remember the variable costs, we know that the variable costs for each cannery will change proportionally.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
What happens to constant costs?

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Constant costs will be the same.

44:36.000 --> 44:44.000
Either we have 0 produced cans or 500,000 cans.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
That is, for one month, one shift.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Per month, one shift.

44:49.000 --> 44:55.000
We see that constant costs do not depend on the volume of production.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Why is that?

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
Because the master of change receives 40,000 rubles per month.

45:01.000 --> 45:10.000
Regardless of whether he is on a constant rate and receives this salary, regardless of whether he was given an order or not.

45:10.000 --> 45:16.000
This is the essence of his contract with the employer.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
In any case, we must pay the master 40,000 rubles for work.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
Even if we have 1, 2 or more cans.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
At the same time, we will pay him the same amount if 500,000 cans are produced.

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
What will happen if more than 500,000 cans are produced?

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
He simply will not be able to control this volume of work.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
Therefore, we must hire another master of change.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
And we must also set up another shift.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
That is, what happens?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
500,000 cans.

45:57.000 --> 46:04.000
Up to 500,000 cans, we will have the same salary of the master of change.

46:04.000 --> 46:11.000
But if we have 500,000 and 10 cans, and we set up a new shift,

46:11.000 --> 46:18.000
even if in the second shift he only released 10 cans, he will still have to pay 40,000 rubles.

46:18.000 --> 46:26.000
If he produces the same 500,000 cans,

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
that is, we will have a million cans produced in two shifts in a month,

46:31.000 --> 46:40.000
we see that we will pay the same 40,000 rubles plus 40,000 rubles, 80,000 rubles per month for two masters.

46:40.000 --> 46:49.000
This is what is called constant costs within a certain range.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
What is the range?

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
The range is from 0 to 500,000.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
The next range is from 500,000 to a million.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
What will happen next?

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
If we need to produce more than a million cans,

47:04.000 --> 47:15.000
we hire a third master, and in three shifts the plant will produce 500,000 cans,

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
500,000 cans per shift, a million in two shifts.

47:19.000 --> 47:25.000
And now let's think about what will happen if we need more than a million and a half cans.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Three shifts are already taken.

47:27.000 --> 47:38.000
We can't increase the number of cans produced from aluminum by hiring a third master.

47:38.000 --> 47:46.000
We need to place the production on a new production area,

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
open an additional workshop, maybe open an additional plant.

47:51.000 --> 47:58.000
This is the concept of the range and the concept of constant costs.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Let's summarize.

48:00.000 --> 48:11.000
We see a table with the number of cans per month and the total salary of shift masters per month in rubles.

48:11.000 --> 48:19.000
That is, from 0 to 500,000 cans, the salary of shift masters will be 40,000 rubles,

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
and from 500,000 to a million, 80,000.

48:24.000 --> 48:33.000
If another shift is added, new constant costs remain constant within the new range.

48:33.000 --> 48:40.000
Constant costs per unit of production change in the opposite dependency on the volume of production,

48:40.000 --> 48:47.000
that is, with the increase in the volume of production, constant costs per unit decrease.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
Now let's see how this happens.

48:50.000 --> 49:00.000
In this table we see the volume of production in pieces, cans, and costs per unit of production,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
that is, costs per can.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
100,000 cans.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
We divide 40,000 rubles, the salary of the shift master, into 100,000 cans,

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
and we have costs per unit of production of 40 kopecks.

49:21.000 --> 49:34.000
With 300,000 cans, 40,000 is divided by 300,000 and we get 13.3 kopecks per can.

49:34.000 --> 49:43.000
With 500,000 cans, 40,000 is divided by 500,000 and we get 8 kopecks per can.

49:43.000 --> 49:56.000
With 600,000, we divide 40,000 by 600,000 and we get 1.03 kopecks.

49:57.000 --> 50:03.000
With 600,000 cans, the volume of production is higher than the volume of predictability,

50:03.000 --> 50:10.000
which means that another shift must be added and another shift master hired.

50:10.000 --> 50:18.000
Now let's look at the table where the dependence of the volume of production of cans in pieces

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
and the costs per unit of production in rubles are shown.

50:22.000 --> 50:34.000
That is, how much does one can cost when we divide the salary of the shift master into the number of cans.

50:34.000 --> 50:42.000
With 100,000 cans, we see 40,000 divided by 100,000 and we get 40 kopecks.

50:42.000 --> 50:50.000
With 300,000 cans, 40,000 is divided by 300,000 and we get 13.3 kopecks.

50:50.000 --> 50:58.000
With 500,000 cans, 40,000 is divided by 500,000 and we see 8 kopecks.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
With 600,000, what can we expect?

51:02.000 --> 51:07.000
We can expect that the cost per can will decrease.

51:07.000 --> 51:13.000
Indeed, we divide 40,000 by 600,000, but what happens?

51:13.000 --> 51:21.000
It turns out that we no longer need to divide 40,000, but 80,000,

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
because we will have one shift added.

51:26.000 --> 51:33.000
That is, it turns out that we will have 13 kopecks again.

51:34.000 --> 51:41.000
That is, with the production of 600,000 cans, the volume of production is higher than the predictability range,

51:41.000 --> 51:48.000
which means that another shift should be added and another shift master should be hired.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
And now, from the analysis of the separateness of constant and variable costs,

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
we will move on to the analysis of the point of cost-payment.

51:58.000 --> 52:09.000
The task is to determine the point of cost-payment and use the marginal profit to determine the point of cost-payment.

52:09.000 --> 52:17.000
The analysis of the point of cost-payment uses the basic elements of the analysis of the cost-payment volume

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
to determine the point of cost-payment.

52:21.000 --> 52:30.000
That is, we see that this type of analysis is called the analysis of the cost-payment volume.

52:30.000 --> 52:35.000
What is required for the analysis of the point of cost-payment?

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
What are the prerequisites?

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
First, the income is equal to the total cost.

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
When the income is equal to the total cost, what do we get?

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
We will not have a profit, but we will not have a loss.

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
And only after that does the company begin to receive a profit.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
The next term is the safety margin.

53:02.000 --> 53:09.000
Under the safety margin, the number of units sold or the volume of sales in rubles is understood,

53:09.000 --> 53:16.000
with which actual sales may fall below planned sales without loss for the company.

53:19.000 --> 53:26.000
Let's see what the general equation for calculating the point of cost-payment will look like.

53:26.000 --> 53:36.000
We use Latin denominations to denote the necessary elements of this equation.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
These denominations are common all over the world, so we can use them.

53:42.000 --> 53:50.000
Sales are denoted by the letter S, which corresponds to the English word sales.

53:50.000 --> 53:58.000
Variable costs are denoted by the Latin letters V and C, which means variable costs.

53:58.000 --> 54:06.000
Constant costs are denoted by the Latin letters F and C, which means fixed costs.

54:06.000 --> 54:13.000
Sales minus variable costs minus constant costs are equal to zero.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
This is the general equation for calculating the point of cost-payment.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
We see it.

54:20.000 --> 54:26.000
S minus VC minus FC is equal to zero.

54:26.000 --> 54:42.000
Sales minus variable costs minus fixed costs is equal to zero.

54:44.000 --> 54:54.000
For example, a company with a limited liability, Metal Product, produces decorative cast-iron stands.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
Variable costs are equal to 500 rubles for a cast-iron stand.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
Constant costs are on average 200,000 rubles per year.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
Each stand is sold for 900 rubles.

55:08.000 --> 55:19.000
The task is to calculate the point of cost-payment for stands in units of sales, where X is the number of units of sales.

55:20.000 --> 55:26.000
We use the formula we just analyzed.

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
S minus VC minus FC is equal to zero.

55:32.000 --> 55:39.000
Sales minus variable costs minus constant costs is equal to zero.

55:40.000 --> 55:50.000
If we substitute 900 times X instead of S, what is 900 times X?

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
Each stand is sold for 900 rubles.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
X is the number of units of sales.

55:58.000 --> 56:07.000
900 times X is the number of units of sales.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
900 times X minus 500 times X.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
X is the number of units of sales.

56:14.000 --> 56:19.000
500 times X is the number of variable costs.

56:19.000 --> 56:26.000
Minus 200 times X is the number of constant costs.

56:26.000 --> 56:35.000
So, in this equation, 900 times X minus 500 times X minus 200,000 is equal to zero.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
First, we calculate the point of cost-payment in units.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
X is equal to 500 units.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
Let's go back and remember how we get this figure.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
900 minus 500 times X.

56:56.000 --> 57:05.000
If we calculate X, we get 900 minus 500 is equal to 400.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
So, we get 400 times X minus 200,000.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
Or 400 times X is equal to 200,000.

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
To calculate X, we divide 200,000 by 400.

57:18.000 --> 57:24.000
Thus, X is equal to 500 units.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
400 times X is equal to 200,000.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
X is equal to 500 units.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
Next, we calculate the point of cost-payment in rubles.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
We multiply 900 by 500.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
What is 900?

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
900 is the price of one stand.

57:54.000 --> 58:01.000
500 is the number of units we produce.

58:01.000 --> 58:09.000
900 times 500 is equal to 450,000 rubles.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
We calculated this equation.

58:11.000 --> 58:20.000
If X is equal to 500 units, we get 450,000 rubles.

58:20.000 --> 58:26.000
We multiply 900 by 500.

58:28.000 --> 58:37.000
I took a scheme that uses international denominations.

58:37.000 --> 58:45.000
This scheme shows the denominations of all terms used in this task.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
We see the value of $20,000.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
These are the constant costs.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
$20,000.

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
Next, we see the fixed costs.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
Next, we see the variable costs.

59:07.000 --> 59:15.000
The line of variable costs is from the constant costs.

59:15.000 --> 59:30.000
The line that goes above the line of the parallel axis of the abscissa is the line of variable costs.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
Next, we see the variable costs.

59:36.000 --> 59:42.000
$50 per unit.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
These are the variable costs.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
Next, we see the constant and variable costs.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:06.000
These are the total costs.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Next, we see the income line.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The word revenue is used to denote the income.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
The total revenue line is the income line.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Next, we see the red line.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
This is the loss line.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.000
When the costs are higher than the income.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Next, we see the green line.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
This is the profit line.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
When the costs are higher than the income.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Next, we see the points where the costs intersect.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
In this example, we see that 500 units.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:07.000
When we calculate 500 units, we see that the profit is equal to zero.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
The loss is equal to zero.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
We see that the costs are equal to the income.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:28.000
We see that all these terms have their application in the international context.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.000
They are common in the world and have the same meaning.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Thank you for watching.
