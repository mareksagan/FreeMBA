00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I am Yendiyev Magomed. I work at the Moscow State University in the Faculty of Economics.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
I am a lecturer, or rather a lecturer, a candidate for Economic Sciences.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
I teach financial markets and corporate finance. I deal with a lot of state finances.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
I have about 200 publications, including about 10 textbooks and monographs.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
I have worked on the order of the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and regional authorities.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
I conduct my own research.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
So, now a few words about what will be in the course.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
We must consider several key points.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
The most important of them, of course, is the assessment of investment projects,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
how to make decisions.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
In order to do this, we will have to go through several preparatory stages.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
One of them is to get acquainted with the discounting procedure.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Another very important one is to choose a discount rate.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
Another very important one is to learn how to assess the cost of financial assets.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
After that, we will move on to the contents of our course.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
We will consider how to make decisions on the basis of the Basic Rules,

01:22.000 --> 01:32.000
and we will also consider how the new ideology of financial accounting affects the current financial operations of the authorities.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
That is, the nuances.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
We will finish here.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
We must start with what you will need to learn to think in a new way.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
This sounds loud, of course, but let's look at an example.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
We are all used to the fact that any product costs as much as the labor is invested in it.

01:54.000 --> 02:04.000
If there was a table here, we could say that this table costs as much as the labor is invested in it.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Next, this is the cost of raw materials, the cost of profitability.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
These are the main positions.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
How much does a financial asset cost?

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
A financial asset costs as much as it will bring benefits in the future.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
If we assessed this table as it should be assessed,

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
we would not say how much labor is invested in it, but what benefits this table will bring in the future.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Here, look, in analogy with the financial asset we will talk about later,

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
it turns out that this table will serve you for 10 years.

02:46.000 --> 02:56.000
The benefit of this table is that you sit at it, you dance on holidays.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
These are the two main positions.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Can the first and second positions be assessed in money?

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
For example, you sit at this table for 10 years, and dance on it, for example, 100 times.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
If we knew the cost of sitting at the table and the cost of our right to dance on the table,

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
we could calculate in the monetary dimension what benefit this table will bring us.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
Accordingly, this would be its price, but not what is invested in it.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Today, we cannot measure the benefit brought by this table,

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
and therefore we traditionally assess it based on the labor invested in it, which is not true.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
Maybe in the future this practice will change, but for now, the future has come for financial assets.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
They are measured, they are assessed based not on how much money is invested in this plant,

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
how much its main funds cost, but on what this asset, share, bond, other securities,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
investment project, how much it will bring in the future.

04:13.000 --> 04:23.000
We should probably pay attention to the fact that there are a number of key moments in changing thinking.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I will name the most important of them.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
The first is the purpose of the company, the purpose of the company's existence.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Traditionally, it was believed that this was a profit.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
In fact, this is not the case.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
In the new financial dimension, this is an increase in capital value,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
or, to put it more clearly, an increase in the value of shares, an increase in capitalization.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Of course, there is a nuance between these statements, but in general, one can say that the purpose of the company is not profit,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
but an increase in the value of the share.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
Although, of course, profit is an important element, no one argues, but the value of the share becomes a more important element.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
The next point is when a company has a profit in the new financial dimension.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
Not when it has an increase in revenue over its value.

05:21.000 --> 05:31.000
No, but when the company's income exceeds the average market value of resources.

05:31.000 --> 05:41.000
Imagine you have capital, 100 rubles, you are trying to do something with it, you are investing.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
At this moment, the average market value of money is 15%.

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
You need to earn 15% per year just to keep your capital at the same level.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
If you earn 16%, you will get a profit of 1%.

06:02.000 --> 06:13.000
If you increase your capital by 12%, you will not get a profit, you will get a loss of 3%.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
Your capital should grow from year to year along with the value of money.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
If this does not happen, you will incur a loss.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
We talked about the purpose of the company, we talked about when profit is formed, when loss is formed.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
The next point is about the value of the share.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
We will only repeat the thesis I mentioned earlier.

06:41.000 --> 06:52.000
The value of a financial asset is the sum of all future income from this asset, from this project.

06:52.000 --> 07:02.000
Since we have a value of money factor, we must discount all these money flows.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
Thus, the value of a financial asset is the value of all future money flows.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
Depending on the situation, it can be either a dividend, or a dividend and amortization, or profit amortization.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
The options are different depending on the situation.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
And the last important point.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
The increase in the value of the company can occur at the time of the announcement of the company plans.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
This is a very interesting position.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
It explains why profit ceases to be the main criterion for the growth of the company.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
With the transition to a new criterion, that is, the increase in the value of the share or capital,

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
with the transition to this new criterion, new opportunities for expanding the business are opened.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
For example, the merger and absorption deals.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
For example, the management of the capital structure.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
For example, relationships with investors.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
For example, the regulation of the work of the board of directors.

08:08.000 --> 08:21.000
All this allows the management of the company to manage its finances not only through the main production, but also through other factors.

08:21.000 --> 08:30.000
At this stage, the announcement of the plans can indicate that the company has a future development prospect.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
These prospects can already be evaluated today, converted into monetary expressions and added to the price of shares.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
This is an approximate mechanism for changing the price after the announcement of the news.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
So, we have considered five main points related to the change in thinking.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
At this point, we will continue to build a mathematical apparatus.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
And then we will move on to the rules of analysis.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
Now the second section.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Here we will consider three main points.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
The discount rate, what it is, the effective interest rate, what it is, how it works.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
And in more detail, we will analyze the topic of the valuation of the financial asset.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
And the financial asset, I repeat, is not only a securities, but also an investment project.

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
So, let's turn to the slide on which you can see the discount rate.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
The logic here is very simple.

09:40.000 --> 09:51.000
Imagine that you have 100 rubles today, and in a year you will get them back together with interest.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
100 rubles today and 100 rubles in a year have different values, otherwise no one would pay interest.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Do you agree?

09:59.000 --> 10:07.000
There is a connection between two events, between two monetary amounts, today and the future.

10:07.000 --> 10:19.000
The discount rate, which is designated under formula number 1, allows us to find a relationship between the future and the current amounts of money.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Let's remember a couple of definitions.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Future value and present value.

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
The fact is that the ideology of discounting was born in the West, and the main terms came to us from there.

10:33.000 --> 10:47.000
We will use foreign words such as future value, present value, in order to correspond to the general spirit of world science.

10:47.000 --> 10:56.000
Russian equivalents of these words are less popular and less in demand.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Although we will use Russian versions as well.

10:59.000 --> 11:08.000
For example, present value is the current or given value of money, and future value is the future value of money.

11:09.000 --> 11:18.000
If we do not take into account the factor of complex percentages, which I think you should know, I have no doubt that you know,

11:18.000 --> 11:27.000
in this case, formula number 2 shows us the relationship between the future amount of money and the current amount of money.

11:28.000 --> 11:37.000
We use the number of years formula and the annual interest rate.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
And we move on to a more interesting point.

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
If the discounting coefficient was a brick, a basic brick of the construction of the entire discounting system,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
now we have to consider a small wall.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
This wall is called the effective interest rate.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Where did it come from?

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
Consumer loans are very common today in Russia and abroad, of course.

12:08.000 --> 12:17.000
If you came in and were interested in the terms, you probably noticed that we are talking about paying interest every month.

12:17.000 --> 12:33.000
If you have an annual interest rate, for example, 12% per year, and you are offered to pay 1% per month on a loan.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
1% multiplied by 12 is 12% per year.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
It seems to be all right. No, it's not right.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
Because 1% per month is more than 12% per year.

12:45.000 --> 12:58.000
In order to determine the real cost, the real rate of interest rate when we pay more than once a year, we use the number 4 formula.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Effective interest rate.

13:00.000 --> 13:13.000
I will repeat again. If on the condition of a loan, some kind of deal, you pay interest not once a year, but more often,

13:13.000 --> 13:24.000
then in this case you must recalculate the rate you have been declared, which will be nominal, in fact, into the effective rate.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
At the same time, M, I draw your attention to, is the number of periods of interest per year.

13:30.000 --> 13:38.000
If we have quarterly interest rate, then M is equal to 4, if monthly, then 12.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
M multiplied by N is the total number of periods of interest.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
The formula is not difficult.

13:47.000 --> 13:56.000
Try to calculate it. Go to the nearest bank, find out their conditions, and then calculate. It will be interesting.

13:56.000 --> 14:07.000
I draw your attention to the fact that the order of work with interest rates has its own peculiarities.

14:07.000 --> 14:20.000
For example, here is a mini-task. You have an income for each of the four quarters. How to find the total income per year?

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
This is very close to what we just discussed. Effective rate, but on the contrary.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
We know the income for each of the four quarters. How to calculate the total annual income?

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
Here are two options. The first option is to add up all the income per quarter and divide it by 4.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
A beautiful option, but not the right one.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
The more correct option is to do as written in formula number 5.

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
This approach allows you to find the annual interest rate in this case.

14:54.000 --> 15:05.000
In addition, the interest rate can be either announced in advance, for example, to the banks when they issue a loan,

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
or you can calculate the profitability of the financial instrument in other ways.

15:11.000 --> 15:21.000
For example, the stock was worth 100 rubles when you bought it. You sold it when it was worth 120 rubles.

15:22.000 --> 15:32.000
If we subtract 100 from 120 and divide it by 100, we get what is called the profitability of the financial instrument.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
In this case, the profitability is 20%.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we said 20%, but when we apply the formula,

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
we substitute the formula for the share, not the percentage.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
We said 20%, but we substitute the formula for 0.2.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
8% is 0.08.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
For your convenience, here is a couple of formulas, 6 and 8.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Formula number 6.

16:06.000 --> 16:17.000
Please note that it is proposed to calculate the profitability based on the parameters of the financial instrument.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
The next formula is very interesting.

16:21.000 --> 16:31.000
It shows you the profitability for the current year of the financial instrument.

16:31.000 --> 16:39.000
You need to take the income you get from the share, the bond, the project for one year

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
and compare it with the current price of the asset.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Then you will get the profitability for the year.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
This is an interesting formula because it will be repeated in different variations.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Here is an example.

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
Imagine that you get 30 rubles per share for a year.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
The value of the share you bought was 100 rubles.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
Therefore, your current profitability is 30%.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
It's not difficult.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
The next formula is more difficult, but not deadly.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It is the calculation of complex percentages.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
We omit the mathematical justification so as not to make our course too complicated.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Let's move on to the formula.

17:32.000 --> 17:44.000
Please note that this formula shows the relationship between the future value of money and the current value of money

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
taking into account the complex percentages.

17:46.000 --> 17:53.000
Complex percentages mean that you have to refinance the funds you have.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
This means that you cannot keep the money just on the account.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
The money must be in investments and bring some income all the time.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
This is the logic of constant reinvestment.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
It is applied to everyone who works in the financial markets.

18:10.000 --> 18:18.000
Otherwise, if you live in simple percentages, you will incur financial losses.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
This formula is very simple.

18:21.000 --> 18:34.000
If we have two periods, then we will have a slightly different example.

18:34.000 --> 18:57.000
The formula is not difficult.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
The next topic is the assessment of the value of a financial asset.

19:04.000 --> 19:14.000
This topic is very important because it will be the basis for learning how to apply investment decisions in new financial conditions.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
We will consider three financial instruments.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
The credit resource, bonds, and shares.

19:23.000 --> 19:33.000
The assessment of the value of each of them has the same logic.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
It is a set of cash payments, each of which is discounted.

19:39.000 --> 19:48.000
We start with the credit resource and determine the conditions.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
What do we understand in this case under the credit resource?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
You are in debt.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
You are charged a percentage every time.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
But you do not pay it.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
You are charged a percentage and you do not pay it.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
You pay.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Let's clarify.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You are charged a percentage.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
You do not pay it.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
You are charged a percentage.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You do not pay it.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
The end of the loan period comes.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
At this moment, you pay the main amount of the loan and all the remaining interest.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
These are the conditions.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
In order to determine the current value of the money according to this condition,

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
based on all the future payments we know,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
we use the formula presented on the slide.

20:43.000 --> 20:51.000
Please note that the present value and the future value are connected.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
This connection between them is very similar to the discount rate.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
If you stop now and return to the beginning of our course to see what the discount rate is,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
you will see a direct connection.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
This brick is located between these two parameters.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Future value and present value.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
The second formula is indicated nearby, which has a little more parameters.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
This is to take into account the multiplicity of the percentage calculation throughout the year.

21:24.000 --> 21:32.000
The first option is for the case when you calculate the percentage only once a year.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
There may be many years, 2, 3, 10, but they are calculated once a year.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
The second option is the same formula for the case when the percentage is calculated quarterly,

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
monthly or in some other period, once every six months, for example.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Next.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Estimating the value of the bonds.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
We will now consider the case of discounting the cash flows,

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
when you take a loan,

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
you pay the interest every month,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
then the end of the loan period comes,

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
you pay the last interest and return the main amount of the loan.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
This is the scheme of cash flow bonds.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Although in some cases it may be suitable for loans.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
But we are talking about bonds now.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
So, you took a loan,

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
pay interest every quarter or every month or another period,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
and finally, you pay the last payment on the bond,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
the last coupon and pay the main amount of the loan.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
To make it easier to understand,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
pay attention to the slide,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
to the formula associated with annuity.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Annuity is the flow of equal amounts of money

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
arising over equal periods of time.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
For example, annuity is when you,

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
or you pay 50 rubles per quarter.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
You pay 50 rubles, this is annuity.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Another example.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
For example, you are a student,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
and you receive a stipend of 3000 rubles every month.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
This is annuity.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
You are paid the same amount of money every month

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
over equal periods of time.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
The next formula shows us how easy it is,

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
avoiding this long formula number 12,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
how easy it is to calculate the cost of annuity.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Again, we are not talking about simply adding up

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
all these 3000 rubles you are paid as a student

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
in the form of a stipend

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
and getting some amount as a result.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
For example, in 10 months, it will be 30,000 rubles.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
No, we must discount every 3000 rubles,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
but all at different periods of time.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
In this case, you will find out the current cost

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
of all your future payments.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
By the way, if you want to sell your right to receive a stipend,

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
you will also need to discount these money flows

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
and get their value.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
In any case, try to calculate for the sake of interest.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
You can stop the course and calculate how much you cost.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
To do this, sign up for the future,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
as far as you know,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
as far as you know for the future,

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
sign up for all your income.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
It can be a salary, a stipend, or something else.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Then discount each of these payments

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
by today.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Add up and you will find out how much you cost

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
from a financial point of view.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
The cost of a person in this case

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
means his ability to generate financial flows.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Let's go back to our formula.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Formula 13 allows you to calculate the cost

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
of an annuity in a very convenient formula.

25:14.000 --> 25:21.000
S is monthly, quarterly, or annual payment.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
K is the capitalization coefficient.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
It is the opposite of the discounting coefficient.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
So, we now have two coefficients,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
capitalization and discounting.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
The discounting coefficient reduces,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
for example, the amount of the future

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
to the present value.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
The amount of the future is reduced.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
The capitalization coefficient, on the contrary,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
increases the amount of the present

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
to the future.

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
So, the formulas are quite simple.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
It's simple math.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
We omit the basis.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
Now, if we add up the cost of annuity

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
to the cost of the principal amount of the loan

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
which is paid at the end of the term,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
we get the cost of the obligation.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Look at the next slide.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
You will see a rather large formula.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
It means the following.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
We have two coefficients.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
The first coefficient is the discounted amount

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
of all our coupon payments.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
This first coefficient can be replaced

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
by the previous formula,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
the cost of annuity.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
But if your payment for a coupon is different,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
of different sizes,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
then it is better to use this formula

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
in which each coupon is counted and discounted separately.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
The second coefficient is the discounted amount.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Please note that the discounting coefficient

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
is present here in the open form.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Now, let's talk about the valuation of the share price.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Nothing changes with a flat account.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
It's the same money flows,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
but in this case, it's not a coupon,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
as it was in the case of the obligation,

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
but a dividend.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
These are the regular dividends

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
that we will receive in the future.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Each of these dividends is discounted,

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
that is, it is brought to the present day,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
and then they all add up.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
This is the value of the share.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Pay attention to the slide.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Here, the current price of the share

27:42.000 --> 27:50.000
in the future period is highlighted in dark color.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
The logic behind the construction of this formula is as follows.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Imagine that you know the value of the share

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
in a period, for example, a year.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
In this case, it is PV1.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Then the current price of the share,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
which we want to calculate,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
will be the discounted dividend

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
plus the discounted value of the share

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
at the end of the next year.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
If we do not know the value of the share

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
at the end of the first year,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
but we know the value of the share

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
at the end of the second year,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
you can look at the second line of calculations.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Here is what our formula will look like.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
We discount the DDIV1 dividend.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
We then discount the dividend of the second year

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
by two years,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
and the price of the share at the end of the second year.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
But we still do not know the price of the share

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
at the end of the second year.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Therefore, we take this process of determining this price

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
for another year.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Now it turns out that our current price of the share

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
is equal to the discounted dividend of the first year,

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
the discounted dividend of the second year,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
note that the second degree is already there,

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
and the discounted dividend and the price at the end of the third year,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
note that the discount is in the third degree.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
Thus, by postponing the moment of determining the price of the share

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
in the future, we come to a very interesting conclusion,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
to a very interesting result.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
It turns out that there comes a moment

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
when this PV in the future, for example,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
PV of the 60th year or PV of the 100th year,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
it becomes unusually small,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
so small that it can be neglected.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
Thus, we return to what we started with.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
The cost of the asset is equal to the discounted cost

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
of all payments on it, in this case dividends.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Mathematically, it is easier to write all this down,

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
but for this we will have to make assumptions.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
We must assume something about the dividend.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
For example, we can assume that the dividend is constant,

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
or that it is growing at the same pace all the time,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
or something else.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
These first two points are the most common.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
So, if the dividend is constant,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
then pay attention to the slide,

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
we will get a formula that we have already met.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
This is the formula of the current cost,

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
sorry, this is the formula of the current profitability.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
You saw it, you can scroll back and look at it,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
it is presented there in a different form.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Here, the meaning of this formula is that

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
by comparing the dividend and the current market value of money,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
you get the value of the asset.

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
So, if you get 20 rubles every year,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
in the infinite future,

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
for many, many years in a row,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
the cost of money today is 10%,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
then what is the cost of this asset?

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
In other words, what is the cost of the securities

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
that you become the owner of every year for 20 rubles?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Unlimited amount of time.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Let's count.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
20 must be divided by, not by 10%,

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
we will repeat that in these formulas,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
we say percentages, but in formulas we use fractions.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
So we must divide 20 by 0.1.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
We get 200.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Consequently, the cost of the money flow,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
unlimited amount of time,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
20 units of the annual income,

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
at the market value of money 10%,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
is equal to 200 units.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
For this amount, you can safely buy this asset.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
The next formula is for the case

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
when the dividend is growing at a constant rate.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
We omit the mathematical justification,

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
noting that PV0 is the asset value today,

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
is equal to the dividend of the next period,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
divided by the specified difference,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
where G is the rate of dividend growth.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
I would like to ask you a question.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I will use the case.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Well, no questions are allowed,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
we have a course.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
What do you think about the offer

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
to get an unlimited dividend,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
just a very large dividend,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
but in 100 years?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Let's do it this way, 3 seconds.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Are you for or against?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Do you like it or not?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
So, 1, 2, 3.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You made a decision.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Now the right answer.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
This offer should be rejected.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
And not only because 100 years is more than a lifetime.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
No matter how large the dividend is,

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
being discounted for 100 periods,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
its price today will be miserable.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
Therefore, I propose you a very large dividend in the future.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
I will not lie to you,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
but this is wrong.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Great.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
And now another question.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
We said that the dividend can be constant,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
it can grow at a constant rate,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
it can fall at a constant rate.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
And another situation when the dividend is zero.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Please answer the question,

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
why some of the Russian dividends

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
that do not pay dividends

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
have a market price,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
have a market rating.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
According to the logic of things,

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
if this stock does not have a dividend,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
there is nothing to discount,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
and the current value should be equal to zero.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
So, we count to three.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Your suggestions.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Count them for yourself.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
One, two, three.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
The main answer,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
related to this situation,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
when the dividend is zero,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
is as follows.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
The market is guided by the fact

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
that in the future the company will start paying dividends.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
This is one.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
The second.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
The company has a residual value,

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
which can be distributed between shareholders

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
in the event of its implementation.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
These are the two main points

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
that do not allow the price of the asset to fall to zero.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Let's continue.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Now, after we have figured out

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
how to evaluate financial assets,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
we move on to the next topic.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Now we need to figure out

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
how we will evaluate the value of a financial asset.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I repeat,

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
all our decisions related to the assessment of the investment project

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
will be based, one way or another,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
on the analysis of cash flows

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
and on the analysis of the value of the investment project.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Therefore, we need to analyze

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
two key points

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
that are applicable to the investment project.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
The first key point

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
is related to the determination of the discount rate

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
for the investment project.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
The second key point

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
is related to the calculation

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
and determination of cash flows,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
that is,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
what is the analogue of a coupon

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
or a dividend for an investment project.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
First, let's say a few words about investment decisions.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
What is it?

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
We have already talked about it for almost a quarter of the course.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
What are investment decisions?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
We did not mention it.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
We do.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Investment decisions are decisions

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
made based on the analysis

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
of incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
These can be decisions related to

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
whether to accept or not accept an investment project for financing,

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
suspend or even stop an investment project.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
In some cases,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
stopping the project can be beneficial.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Oddly enough.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
Choose or review the sources of financing.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
There may be other options.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
The most important thing,

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
including the one related to the merger and absorption deals,

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
is to accept or not accept an investment project.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
So,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
let's deal with the calculation

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
and determination of the cash flows.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
In the simplest case,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
you can use

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
the data of the profit and loss report,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
for example,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
to sum up the profit after tax and amortization.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
This is a simple way to determine the cash flow.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
But it is very incorrect.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
There are options related to this approach.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
For example,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
you can calculate the profit before tax

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
and add amortization to it.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
You can calculate the profit before tax

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
and add amortization to it.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
But this does not remove the key claim to this method.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
The cash flow is not reflected there.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
We are not interested in accounting estimates of finances and cash flows.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
We are interested in the cash flow.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Therefore,

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
the cash flow should correspond to the difference

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
between the balance sheets at the beginning and end of the year.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
To get to this amount,

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
the so-called indirect method of calculation is used.

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
We will need to sum up the cash flows

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
in three main directions

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
that each company has in its operation.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
These are the cash flows from the main activity,

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
the cash flows from the investment activity,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
and the cash flows from the financial activity.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
You can see them on this slide.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
Now, let's take a look at each of the cash flows.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
The first is the cash flow from the main activity.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
We are interested in,

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
I repeat,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
the cash flow.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
To calculate this,

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
we take the profit as a basis for the account after the tax.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
We must correct this profit.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
We must restore the amortization in it.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Next, we must correct,

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
in other words, restore the non-realized profit or loss,

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
as well as correct the balance sheet.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
For example,

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
if we have increased the commodity-material reserves

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
over the year,

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
we had commodity-material reserves,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
for example, at 100 units,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
and now we have commodity-material reserves at 120 units.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
This is the inflow of money or outflow.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
I repeat,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
commodity-material reserves have changed.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
From 100 to 120.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Your answer?

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
In fact, this means the outflow of money.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I hope our answers are correct.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Why outflow?

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
Because 20 units of growth required the withdrawal of money.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
That is, the money you had

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
was directed to increase the commodity-material reserves.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
This means the outflow of money from your disposal.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
For example,

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
such an article of balance as the account for payment.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
For example, the account for payment has increased.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
What does this mean?

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
You had an account for payment,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
that is, what you have to pay.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
You had an account for payment of 50,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
and you have an account for payment of 70.

41:13.000 --> 41:19.000
This means that you owe someone 20 units more.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
In theory, you should have given this 20 units to someone,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
but you did not.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
This means the outflow of money to you.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This money should have left you.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
You did not allow this.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Because of this, you left this money with you.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
This means the outflow of money.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Based on this logic, you calculate the balance sheet.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
As for non-realizable profits or losses,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that if you have a profit,

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
you take this number with a minus sign when you correct it.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Because this profit is already taken into account

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
in the total amount of the profit of the company

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
that we took as a base.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I will repeat myself again.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
To calculate the money flows from the main activity,

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
you take the profit after the tax payment

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
and start to correct it.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
You add amortization to it, which you withdrew from it earlier.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Then you add or subtract profit or loss.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
If you had a non-realizable profit, you subtract it.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Because before that, this profit was taken into account.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
If there was a loss, then you add it.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
Then you correct it on the balance sheet.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
The next one is the flow of money from investment activities.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
The word itself, investment activity,

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
explains the meaning of the operations carried out.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
In fact, there are two key positions.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
The first is the purchase or sale of securities for the purpose of investment.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Or the purchase or sale of the main assets.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
This is also an investment.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
So, by and large, you will have only two articles.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
Purchase of main assets, purchase of securities.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
Sale of main assets, sale of securities.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Please note that you do not reflect dividends here.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
Here only the general movement of resources is reflected.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
The next one is the third component of the money flows.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
The flow of money from financial activities.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
Under the word financial activity,

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
the attraction of companies and resources to their goals is understood.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
That is, the issuance of securities,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
the issuance of shares,

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
the cancellation of shares,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
the issuance of bonds,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
the cancellation of bonds.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
What else can there be?

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
The payment of dividends also applies to financial activity.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
This is also quite simple compared to operational activity,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
compared to the main activity.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
This is a simple operation.

44:17.000 --> 44:25.000
In the next slide, you can see an abstract example of a company

44:25.000 --> 44:31.000
that has certain amounts of all three types of activity.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Please note.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
This can be a current year,

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
this can be a forecast for some of the future years,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
this can be a report for some past year.

44:43.000 --> 44:51.000
So, this company has a positive inflow of money from the main activity,

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
of 250 units.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
From investment activity, from the flow of resources,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
from financial activity, there is an inflow.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
How can we characterize this situation?

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
Is this company stable?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Is this company growing?

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Or, on the contrary, is it closing in?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Is it going bankrupt?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Please note.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
The fact that there is a large inflow of resources from financial activity

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
is possible.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
We do not know the structure yet.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
The structure of each of the flows

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
is possible.

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
This is a sign that the company has attracted a lot of borrowed resources.

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
We can assume that it did this to develop its main business.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
Please note that the main business in the company is profitable.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
It gives a positive flow of money.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
The business has prospects,

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
since it is attracted by borrowed funds.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Please note that according to the article,

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
investment activity takes place from the flow of resources.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
This is not good or bad.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
Perhaps this is hidden by the fact that the company,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
for example, sells some of its assets

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
to mobilize additional investment resources.

46:16.000 --> 46:24.000
In this case, the company gets 550 units of investment resources.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
In fact, there are no 450.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Once again.

46:29.000 --> 46:34.000
From financial activity, we have an inflow of 500 units.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
These are the funds that have come to the company.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
According to investment activity, we have a flow of 50 units.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
This means that we bought something with this money.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Some equipment.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Perhaps last year,

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
this company also had a large inflow

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
through the channels of financial activity.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
And this money, perhaps not very large,

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
but it had.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
And this money was used to purchase equipment.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
In this case, we see the result of last year's decision.

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
This is 50 units of money flow,

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
flow for some investment purposes.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
Let's hope that the company develops its business.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
Now, please refer to the next slide.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Here you see the formula,

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
which shows the method of calculating the money flow of money.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
The formula is extremely complex.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
Its point is to sum up the money flows in each direction.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
The resulting figure should be equal to the difference

47:50.000 --> 47:56.000
between the money on the accounts at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period.

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
If there is an equality, then the calculation is correct.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
So, we have dealt with the money flows.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
Now, in order to calculate the cost of the investment project,

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
we must determine the rate of discounting.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Sorry for the tautology.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
We will consider three main points.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
The first is the alternative rates.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
We will consider the VACC model,

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
the average model of average expenses on capital.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
And we will consider the CAPM model,

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
the model of the value assessment of capital assets.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
So,

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
as for the alternative rates,

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
when determining the rate of discounting,

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
we will consider the rate of discounting.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
For example, you can take as a rate

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
the profitability of the stock market index

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
for a certain period of time, for a year.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
You can conduct a survey among shareholders

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
on what they want to have in their investments.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
If you have a responsible investor

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
and he thinks about what he does with his investments.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
These are two options.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
Next, you can make a market analysis

49:34.000 --> 49:40.000
and see what similar projects have similar risks

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
and what rates there are.

49:42.000 --> 49:48.000
Otherwise, if you do not invest in your project,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
but in some other,

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
how much will you get?

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
For example, the average cost of resources on the market

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
is 7%, 6%, 7.2%, 6.4%.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
You can find an average as an option.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Finally, there may be another option

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
to determine risk-free profitability

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
and add a risk premium to it.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
This is also an option.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
Risk-free profitability or profitability close to it

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
is considered.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
The risk premium can be determined

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
based on the ratings.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
This is also a possible option.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
If the company that implements the project

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
has a rating,

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
then based on the analogy,

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
comparing this rating with other companies,

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
you can determine the risk premium.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
Two words about the risk-free interest rate.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
As you understand from the name,

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
under the risk-free rate,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
such a financial instrument is understood

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
by investing in which you do not take any risk.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
Obviously, in practice, this is almost unrealistic.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
Therefore, such a combination as

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
the maximum risk-free tool is more common.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
To determine the maximum risk-free rate,

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
you need to find an instrument with the lowest risk.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
The measure of risk is the standard deviation.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
This is a term from statistics,

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
and it indicates how much the rating

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
fluctuates from the average value up and down.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
We will not touch on the question of the rate.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
We will only note the following.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
You use the interest rate for the calculation

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
of the standard deviation,

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
and you get the following structure at the output.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
For example, the share.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
The average return per year is 10%.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
The standard deviation is 3%.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
What does this mean?

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
This means that the company that implements the project

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
has a return of 13% to 7% per year.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
The lowest standard deviation,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
as practice shows, is due to bonds.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
These bonds are certainly more reliable than shares.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
Their rate fluctuates from year to year.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
The average return per year is 10%.

52:31.000 --> 52:37.000
The bond is used to determine the maximum risk-free rate.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
The minimum risk-free rate is 3%.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
The standard deviation is 3%.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
The return of the bond is 10%.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
The maximum risk-free rate is 3%.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
The maximum risk-free rate is 3%.

52:57.000 --> 53:03.000
Usually, state bonds are used for such calculations.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
Their risk is lower than the risk of corporate securities,

53:08.000 --> 53:15.000
corporate bonds, regional and municipal bonds.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
If we take countries,

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
usually American bonds are used as a basis.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
In Russia, it can be Russian bonds.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
This is one of the bonds that will need to be chosen.

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
Different bonds have different standard deviations.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
I would like to ask you a question.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
If a bond with the lowest standard deviation,

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
that is, with the lowest risk,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
has negative profitability,

53:52.000 --> 54:01.000
how can we take negative profitability as a risk-free rate?

54:01.000 --> 54:08.000
You can take this negative value by the module

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
and use it as a risk-free rate.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Why?

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
Because we assume that you can trade securities

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
both on growth and on their fall.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
You can earn this profitability,

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
but with a positive sign.

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
We have discussed a small set of issues

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
related to the risk-free rate.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
Now we will move on to the next item,

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
namely, to determine the rate of discounting

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
based on the VACC model.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
Please look at the next slide.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
Formula 19.

54:57.000 --> 55:04.000
It shows us that if we take these companies as a basis,

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
we can calculate how much this company

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
is covered by the loans it has.

55:13.000 --> 55:19.000
We can even say that all the capital attracted by this company.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Capital consists of two key parts.

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
This is the debt and the debt-related capital.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
This is from shares and bonds.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
There may also be long-term credit resources.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
We will also consider them.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
This formula has weights.

55:43.000 --> 55:48.000
They correspond to the weight of each source of financing

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
in the capital structure.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
This formula has a letter T,

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
which means corporate tax.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
What does this mean?

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
The fact is that the payments per percent

56:07.000 --> 56:13.000
of bonds are paid from the profit to the tax.

56:17.000 --> 56:23.000
The dividend for the shares is paid after the tax.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
Therefore, these two parameters,

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
the cost of the debt and the cost of long-term credit,

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
will be incomparable.

56:38.000 --> 56:44.000
It must be brought to a single denominator.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
Using this bracket, 1-T,

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
we try to bring the costs of the debt capital

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
to the comparable value with the costs of the shares.

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
Usually, VACC is calculated based on the data of the balance sheet.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
It would be difficult to calculate VACC

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
based on the data of the open market.

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
Imagine that the company has a share market.

57:19.000 --> 57:25.000
The price of the share will change every second.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
Therefore, the weight of the shares and bonds

57:30.000 --> 57:36.000
in the capital structure must change every second.

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
The company will be tired of recalculating its VACC every time.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
To determine this parameter,

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
which is intended to determine the cost

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
of the capital,

57:55.000 --> 58:01.000
it is best to use the data of the balance sheet.

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
Unfortunately, using the data of the balance sheet

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
does not allow us to take into account the risk factor.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
We will talk about this later.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
As an example, you can see a small calculation on the slide.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
Its purpose is to show that there is a ratio

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
between the debt and the debt assets.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
It is 0.5.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
According to mathematics, it is 2 to 1.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
That is, two units here, one unit here.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
The ratio between them is 0.5.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
And if we talk about the debts,

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
then there are only three debts.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
Accordingly, two thirds are divided into one part

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
and one third into the second part.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Accordingly, we have the cost of the loan

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
and we know the cost of the assets.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
The cost of the loan is 10%.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.000
10% is the cost of the debt that we pay.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
29% is the cost of the dividend.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
By substituting all this formula,

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
by substituting the tax rate,

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
we can determine that the average company expenses

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
per capita are 21.

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
The next slide shows us the CAPM model,

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
the evaluation of the cost of long-term assets.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
This model is mainly intended for the evaluation of the stock.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
It has a very interesting fate.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
The fact is that in an attempt to find

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
the most diversified portfolio,

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
foreign scientists came across an interesting fact.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
The more paper you combine into a portfolio,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the less risk you have of a portfolio

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
expressed by a standard deviation.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
If you look at the graph,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
in this case, you see that the risk of the stock is on one axis.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Horizontally, the number of valuable papers included in the portfolio is delayed.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
At the moment when there is only one paper in the portfolio,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
the risk of this portfolio is maximum.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
When two papers are combined, the risk is slightly reduced.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
When three papers are combined, the risk is slightly reduced.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
When ten papers are combined, the risk is slightly reduced.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
But what is interesting is that from some point on,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
depending on the market,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
the risk of the portfolio stops falling.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
This is a very interesting discovery,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
which has led to the better understanding of the nature of the risk of valuable papers.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It turns out that the risk consists of two parts.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The first part is the so-called systemic risk,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
the risk from which it is impossible to get rid of any diversification.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Whatever you do, if you buy a stock,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
you bear this risk anyway.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And for this, by the way, you get a reward.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Because the second part of the risk is related to the issuer itself.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So the second part of the risk can be eliminated.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
If it can be eliminated, then the market does not pay you for such a risk.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
If you take both risks, this is your problem.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
This is what the market thinks.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
According to experts, it is quite fair.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
So, a little conclusion.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
If you want to invest, if you buy one valuable paper,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
you take two risks.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
One is paid for by the market,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and the second is not paid by anyone.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
You take an unpaid, unnecessary risk.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Therefore, in any case, you need to build a portfolio

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
and try to avoid unnecessary risk.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
In general, this is a recommendation.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Now, based on this fact,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
that the risk is made up of two parts,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
a model was built,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
we omit the mathematical justification,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
which is called CAPM.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
This is Formula 21.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
The meaning of this model is that

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
there is a direct dependence

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
between the profitability of the paper

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and the average profitability of the market.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
If the profitability of the market changes,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
then the profitability of your paper should change.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
To express this as fully as possible,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
a special coefficient was introduced.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
In fact, it is close to the parameter of standard deviation.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
At least the formulas are mathematically similar.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000
You have a formula for calculating the beta coefficient in the conspect.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
You can familiarize yourself with it.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Now, pay attention to the slide again.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The beta coefficient, which is presented in this formula,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
has a fairly simple meaning.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Imagine that your company has a beta coefficient

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and the beta coefficient is 2.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
This means that every time the profitability of the market changes by 1%,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the profitability of your paper will change by 2%.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
If the beta coefficient is 3,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
this means that every time the profitability of the market changes by 1%,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
the profitability of your paper changes by 3%.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Or it should change.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
So, if the beta coefficient is negative 1, what does it mean?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
This means that for every unit of the market fall,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
your paper should grow by 1 unit.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
If your coefficient is 0.5,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
this means that for every coefficient of the market growth,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
your paper grows by only 0.5%.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
This is a very good coefficient that allows you to choose papers

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
in order to build a certain kind of portfolio.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Aggressive, defensive, or some other.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So, you can look at a small example,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
here on the slide,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000
which is intended for calculating profitability according to the CAPM model.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
If, for example, we have a risk-free profitability of 6%,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
the profitability of the market is 12%,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
the beta coefficient of our share is 1.5,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I remind you what 1.5 means.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
This means that for every percent of the market growth,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
the profitability of the share should grow by 1.5%.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
We calculate the profitability according to the CAPM model.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So, it turns out that the profitability of our paper should be 15%.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
We have considered several options for determining the discount rate,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
and before that, we have analyzed the questions related to determining the money flows.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:43.000
In each case, you need to conduct a separate study

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and try to justify the choice of one or another discount rate as logically as possible.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
There are no universal rules for determining the discount rate.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
After making a choice, after analyzing the market,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.000
you have to choose the discount rate that is the most correct for you.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Now let's move on to the next topic.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
We will now deal with the adoption of investment decisions.
