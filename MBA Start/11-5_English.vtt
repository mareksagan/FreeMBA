00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.660
Unusual industries, which

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.680
are called B2B, or industrial marketing.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.080
What many companies do is

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.620
that this business started business,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.260
medium and small business in the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.940
regions of Russia, when companies

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.720
began to sell raw materials,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.880
components, machines, equipment,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.820
tractors and much more.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.400
B2B and marketing.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.420
A few words about the specifics of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.840
positioning, but from the beginning of the definition.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
Industrial marketing is a concept

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.820
that describes the marketing of goods

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.480
and services for an organization for

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.080
B2B organizations.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.980
Organization in this case

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.880
means the organization of all

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.180
types - commercial, non-profit,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.900
private, public, government,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.560
producers and sellers.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.760
There are features of purchasing

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.820
behavior in industrial

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.480
marketing that define how

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.760
positioning should be built.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.840
The first feature â€“ potential

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.980
buyers can be individually

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.000
identified.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.360
We know exactly who will buy from us, unlike

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.200
B2C marketing, where we don't know who

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.720
will come to the store and who will

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.660
take our goods off the shelf.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.420
The second difference is that the decision-making

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.480
process is organized.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.480
Every company has a certain

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.680
procedure according to which

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.500
the company makes a decision.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.320
When we talk about marketing, for this

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.940
industry we need to understand that

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.900
it should help us make decisions

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780
in our favor.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.360
The third feature is that the purchases

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.780
are carried out professionally.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640
Of course, this cannot be said

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.000
of all the companies that buy

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.620
our products, but in general

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.560
we assume that when we sell

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.740
goods of industrial value,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.600
we are faced with a certain

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.860
system involving people

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.060
who call themselves professionals.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.960
So they use some criteria

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.600
that are important to them.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.520
and end.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.020
The fourth is the high

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.700
probability of re-buy.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.700
Per this is the happiest time when

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.680
the company came to the fact

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.360
that its customers became

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.540
regular customers.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.960
Then efforts to find new customers

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.840
are slowed down, the company gets

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.360
current revenue without increasing

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.700
its efforts and energy to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940
find new customers.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.940
The next.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.060
This slide shows the specifics

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.140
of industrial and consumer

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.600
marxing and shows the future

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.060
of Russian companies,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.540
which work in both the one

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.900
and the other marxing.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.120
From the point of view of the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.300
product, the development of products,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.540
for example, in the system of industrial

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.020
marxing, is linear.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.120
Computers are improved,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.460
their power is built,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.380
the productivity of equipment is built.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.540
In consumer Marxism, everything

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.240
is cyclical.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.520
Men wear costumes on three

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.080
buttons, then on two, then on one,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.200
then again on three.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.500
This cyclicity is repeated with

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.360
small fluctuations.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.560
Therefore, the second element of

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.240
the product that strikes us and

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.920
makes us restrain is the stimulus.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.420
In industrial marxing, technology

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.880
is very important.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.380
How everything is built, what we give,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.400
how we change.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.720
In consumer marxing, fashion is important,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.140
and therefore the marketer

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.580
is required to shape

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.920
fashion.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.660
The consumer in industrial

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.880
marxing chooses on the basis

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.860
of objective criteria.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.360
Objective criteria are difficult

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.940
to break, and in consumer marxing

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.120
people choose on the basis of subjective

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.180
criteria.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.920
When you sell clothes, you

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.840
understand that people have different

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.900
criteria.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.380
One likes brown, the other likes

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.860
red, the third likes gray, the fourth

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.780
likes blue.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.120
And it is difficult for us to pick up,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.920
but that determines our Marxist activity.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.320
Finally, see, consumers in

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.620
industrial marxing tend

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.380
to use the left hemisphere.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.760
They are supposed to be very

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.620
rational, they compare the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.120
selection criteria, and then say

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.740
that we will buy products from

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.320
that company.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.780
Consumer Marxism has such

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.060
a property, we know that

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.660
in many cases the client

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.960
is irrational.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.340
It is guided by the right hemisphere,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.860
which is the hemisphere that

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.000
controls our emotions.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.440
Finally, two other aspects

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.160
that always interest me.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.620
The macro-cultural aspect

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.980
Two of cultures.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.400
In industrial Marxism, science is very

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.420
important.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.040
And your advancement,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.380
your marxism, is artistic.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.080
And finally, another cultural coverage.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.040
If in industrial marxing the

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.100
scope is globalized, and this means

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.560
that everything that is

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.280
created in the West, in the field

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.080
of technology, in the field of

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.800
computerization, sooner or later

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.640
comes to us with small changes,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.320
then the consumer sector shows

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.120
a huge specificity associated

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.440
with cultural boundaries.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.360
And this means that a marketer should

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.900
understand the country in which

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.180
he lives more.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.180
The conclusion I will make

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.720
now is very unusual.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.920
I predict that in industrial marketing

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.960
in the context of globalization,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.040
Russia's entry into the World

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.720
Trade Organization, many

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.660
marketers will have to

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.620
be hard, because they do

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.660
not define anything.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.220
And that the marketer's

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.500
job in consumer marxing will

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.540
remain behind Russia, because

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.780
no one, like Russia, knows the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.480
specifics of this culture.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.100
And I don't think that neither

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.580
the French, nor the Americans, nor

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.540
the Germans will be able to interpret

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.080
consumer motives better than,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.520
for example, Russian marketers.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.420
And lastly, the analogy of the profession.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.460
If industrial marxism is more with a lawyer

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.640
and a doctor, then consumer

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.320
marxism is more with a politician

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.720
and a showman.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.420
I always look at this picture and

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.880
tell you where would you like

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.860
to be doing Marxism?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.180
What would you like to do as a Marxist?

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.020
The consumer?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.400
Or an industrial?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.300
Of course, I often talk about consumers.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.040
It is very uninteresting and unambiguous,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.120
and we can say we predict

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.100
industrial marxism.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.180
But that's why I define that there

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.560
are certain difficulties here

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.280
associated with segmentation

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.180
and positioning

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.940
of products.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.980
For industrial marxing for the

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.320
B2B sector, what is called the contact

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.420
points is very important.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.120
This is what every advancement is built on.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.240
And I would like to say that if you

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.840
are working in this field, then the

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.980
most important thing you should

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.360
do is first identify market segments,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.420
which we talked about at the beginning

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.600
of our class, and then say what

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.340
is the points of contact

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.020
with customers, with those

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.420
rational customers, which

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.180
take on the basis of some objective

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.240
criteria.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.200
Look at my example, which shows

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.220
that when we sell equipment, metals,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.060
raw materials, components,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.840
we must understand that we must

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.000
have a good website, a good

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.620
office, good business cards

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.860
that we pass on to customers,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.780
we must look decent at the

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.420
exhibitions we participate in,

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.440
we must fit the place of sale,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.140
especially our negotiating

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.860
well, and finally we must

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.260
have relevant advertising

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.320
that is often very rational

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.620
and explains to the customer

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.080
why it comes.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.000
I say this is why, because

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.460
it may be the basis of promotion,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.580
do not build illusions, industrial

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.060
marketing will never be like

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.020
consumer, it is much duller, but

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.460
also more rational,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.260
but this has its charm, here

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.760
even in this you must bring

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.280
elements of art, show

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.420
the beauty and value of

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.720
the brand that you offer

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.920
to the market.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.900
This is the property in some

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.060
small operations, which are associated

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.660
with the fact that in the points of contact

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.880
with the customer the customer must see

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.600
the distinctive features

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.180
of your company, differentiate it by

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.300
the office, by the site, by the business

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.340
cards, by the exhibitions, by the

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.360
negotiation, that is, by the place

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.100
of sale and by your advertising.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.160
And finally it may be the most interesting.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.780
In 2000, two researchers, Rust

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.340
Lemman, first proposed an unusual

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.720
concept that would otherwise

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.100
be able to counter what

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.400
we call B2B marketing, namely the

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.840
concept of consumer capital.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.680
What is it?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.660
The authors view consumer

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.320
capital as a set of individual controlled

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.060
factors, and consumers themselves

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.600
as a financial asset of

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.640
a company.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.560
This is such an unusual view,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.920
because traditionally marketing

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.380
implies that we have a product and

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.760
service to sell to the customer.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.520
They first saw a different value

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.120
when we work in industrial marketing,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.960
the customer often buys.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.100
What should be done to eliminate

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.500
the word product

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.160
and focus on the consumer?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.740
The term they picked up is

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.300
very interesting, consumer capital.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.360
And for me, the very important conclusion

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.660
is the danger of slave

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.660
following the product

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.940
orientation without consumer orientation.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.180
So what should we do so that our

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.520
consumer becomes our capital,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.780
so that he brings more and

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.480
more money?

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.380
There are three rules

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.720
that you must follow.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.110
If I want to move back, then

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.750
we must differentiate our

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.890
positioning based on three

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.510
controlled factors of

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.790
consumer capital.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.990
The first factor is called value capital,

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.250
the second factor is called

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.430
brand capital and the third factor is

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.370
called retention capital.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.490
In all three factors there

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.270
is a differentiation of the firm

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.350
that we must carry through this

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.970
policy in relation to our customers.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.730
The first factor is capital value.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.430
What does this mean?

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.450
When a customer wants to

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.870
buy products from an

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.030
industrial enterprise, he always

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.010
compares, he weighs some offers,

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.170
whether it is our offer

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.050
with the offer of competitors,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:13.090
or your offer with desired

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.210
factors, such as with his

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.370
budget.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.550
This is the first.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.710
Value capital is very important

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.130
when the monetary value of a loyalty

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.690
program is very high.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.270
And two other factors are very important

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.330
when in their relationship

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.270
between the consumer the company

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.170
generates a strong connection.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.310
So I wanted to show you

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.650
that there are some rules that

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.210
suggest that if you want to attract

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.630
first, then you should think

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.490
about what to do in order

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.690
to try to limit the balls they

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.570
are to our customer and

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.750
go to another provider.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.730
Remember, it is very important to

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.210
make the first offer so that you

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.890
have a much more profitable offer

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.770
than the rivals.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.910
Remember that if you don't

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.670
have a good loyalty program, then

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.390
value capital should be very significant.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.790
Remember that if you create a learning

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.390
type of customer relationship as an

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.030
element of the primary

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.970
offer, it also generates a strong

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.690
connection.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.550
And remember that you must create such

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.070
conditions that it is very difficult

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.730
for the customer to switch to your

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.610
competitor.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.750
How can capital increase value?

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.670
There are a few ways, but this

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.350
is the easiest.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.730
Offer higher value, quality of

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.950
convenience, or offer the same

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.270
value as competitors, but

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.270
at a lower price.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.230
Whatever we do, we must proceed

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.310
from the following.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.830
When we create a market

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.370
offer, we have to say that yes,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.450
we can sell the same thing

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.910
at a higher price, but then

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.430
we underestimate capital of value

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.810
and remove one of the elements

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:03.790
of consumer capital that

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.610
is very important to our business.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.330
The next slide.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.130
The second element.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.530
Whatever we offer in the market,

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.550
at whatever price, we will always

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.010
be present in the market of price

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.790
competition unless we recognize

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.030
that another factor

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.470
that affects our choice

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:23.790
is the brand.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.130
This is especially important to understand for

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.950
those companies who have difficulty assessing

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.530
the quality of a product or service before buying.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.290
For example, it is very difficult to assess

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.750
in service marketing.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.170
Yes, services can also be B2B.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.550
Services can also be for B2B industries,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.330
for example.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.650
We conduct seminars

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.070
and advise companies.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.550
In fact, we work in the B2B industry,

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.450
and at the same time it is a service.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.430
It is very difficult to assess

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.310
the quality of a product or service

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.950
initially, and so when we talk about

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.130
how much it can cost, we have

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.010
to say if we have brand capital,

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.490
if we don't, we will always

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.950
have to sell at a low price.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.490
And we compete with the

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.030
same companies, which, again,

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.530
sell at a low price, and therefore

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.390
offer another dumping.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.370
Compare the brands that are here.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.070
I wanted to show.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.410
What is better than this lunch?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.570
Wisconsin, Omas, Waterman or Parker?

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.750
There is nothing in these pennies.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.910
But people who buy them are

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.010
probably more likely to

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.130
refer to the brand and its fame.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.050
The same for many companies.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.750
Sometimes it is very important

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.250
to spend money on a brand.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.290
Western companies allocate

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.670
huge budgets to shape

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.970
the brand image.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.510
Russian companies selling

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.770
metal, why?

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.750
Better to pay and do nothing.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.710
Remember, we are slowly pushing ourselves

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.750
into the price competition and eventually

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.250
the day will come when we will be

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.970
removed from the market.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.890
Let us return to this slide.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.470
Which of the meals are you most pleased with?

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.690
This means in part that this pen

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.970
has achieved that it has created

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.390
brand capital for itself.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.510
The next slide.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.270
Three roles of brand capital that are very

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.630
important.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.530
Brand is important for the B2B

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.230
industry, not less for B2C,

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.550
because it acts as a magnet

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.290
to attract new consumers to

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.090
the company.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.010
For example, in the market

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.350
of industrial commercial transport

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.770
in Russia became, for example,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.090
Volvo and Scania.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.310
People want to buy Volvo trucks.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.770
People want to buy Volvo buses.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.330
And it is difficult to explain because from

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.990
the point of view of rational choice.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.870
They are very expensive buses and trucks.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.330
People prefer something in Russia.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.250
Volvo now has a very large

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.470
market share in this segment.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.910
And of course, competitors who

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.230
want to overtake Volvo

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.570
are facing a problem.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.290
How to do it?

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.270
They often dump, lower prices.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.290
But Volvo does not lose its

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.710
market share because Volvo

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.050
has created what we call

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.150
brand capital.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.050
The second.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.790
Our brand acts as a visiting card

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.650
to remind you of goods and services.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.550


00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.930
This brand helps us marketers

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.290
promote this product.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.810
But most importantly, for this

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.450
brand, the most grateful salespeople,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.150
because they have to contact

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.770
with customers.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.590
And they often have to explain

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.770
why the same product is more expensive.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.670
And finally the last.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.130
A brand generally provides an emotional

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.470
connection between the consumer

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.690
and the company.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.450
It creates something invisible

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.050
that makes people turn to this

00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.850
product.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.570
Pay attention to how you are dressed.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.570
It is a brand policy

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.150
tool, a marketing tool.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.770
Someone binds us to a brand,

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.310
to the ones we wear, to what

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.590
we wear, to what we wear.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:15.870
In the same way, we also face

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.650
a problem in industrial marketing.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.930
The consumer often says no,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.210
we should use these trucks.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.330
It is difficult to convince Coca-Cola in

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.850
Russia that it should not use Volvo

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.210
trucks, because there is some emotional

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.970
connection between these, between

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.990
the consumer and the company,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.890
which were created by Volvo then still

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.630
in the Western market and today the

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.590
company does not even want to consider

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.230
the issue of an alternative.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.050
There are certain rules that

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.130
say that when we think about

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.770
how to get away from a competitor,

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.490
we must measure the brand

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.030
that generally repaired,

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.670
repaired, differentiated us.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.510
I liked the authors of this model saying

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.510
that if you want to understand whether

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.170
a brand is differentiating you or not,

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.810
measure the first brand awareness,

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.970
the second the emotions that a

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.810
brand is causing, the attitude

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.150
toward a brand.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.690
People are happy, happy,

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.950
proud, or just laughing and finally

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.250
brand ethics.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.510
The most painful thing about Russia

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.650
is that we have to face such

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.710
a situation.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.390
We are good at awareness, even better

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.530
in emotions, and are ready

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.110
to generate absolutely creative, completely

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.890
new creative ideas related to advertising,

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.050
but we don't want to notice

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.410
the ethics of the brand.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.710
I think that sooner or later

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.610
companies that use so-called scandalous

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.390
marketing, provocative marketing,

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.090
will face the problem

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.930
that Russians, consumers, will

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.270
begin to evaluate the

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.030
ethics of their brand.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.690
And the most important may be

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.450
the last element of differentiation.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.550
The differentiation of industrial marketing

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.150
includes another very important

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.350
element.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.370
It is necessary in the third component

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.290
of the company, which operates

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.610
in the bitume industries, little

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.090
to offer a good product at a similar

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.590
price, little to create a brand

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.350
that is valuable to the customer.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.090
It is important to create a loyalty

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.490
program, which is called Rust by the

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.370
company "Capital retention".

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.650
What is retention capital?

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.890
This is a trend manifested by

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.050
the consumer in the form of a brand preference,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.430
not explained by objective

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.090
and subjective assessments

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.850
of the brand.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.590
It's just amazing how you can

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.230
explain why a customer wants to

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.970
buy from that company, why he doesn't

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.670
want to switch to another

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.550
company.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.170
Indeed, it is difficult to even

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.650
ask why here, because people

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.790
don't think about it.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.630
It is Rust who for the first time

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.350
expresses this point of view, if you

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.770
want to be a successful

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.430
company, think about how

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.670
to keep your customers.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.190
Of course, there is a Russian company

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.770
tending to measure customer

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.370
loyalty with various types of offers

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.470
and discounts, believing that this

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.950
is why people come to them over

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.430
and over again, but

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.650
in reality we are facing an

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.170
unusual situation.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.710
Loyalty programs are generally

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.950
profitable for many Russian

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.090
companies.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.030
We want to accept that there are

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.450
preferences that are not explained

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.030
by objective estimates, but by something

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.590
else.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.550
What is it?

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.870
The company is building up capital

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.230
retention, offering consumers benefits,

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.530
thanks to which it becomes more

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.550
expensive for them to switch to competitor

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.670
products.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.010
What does this mean in reality?

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.610
We create such conditions of work

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.350
with the customer that assumes

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.930
that if our customer moves to our

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.510
competitor and starts buying

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.870
his products, he faces

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.430
inexplicable difficulties from

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.290
the point of view of consumers.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.650
For example, discomfort of communication,

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.950
discomfort of filling out forms,

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.570
discomfort of explaining a situation

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.670
and much more.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.350
I have encountered an unusual case in

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.950
Russia when one of the companies

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.950
is ready to go on to make their

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.430
customers even develop a plan of

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.910
supply that they need for the entire program.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.070
Imagine how a company profoundly serves

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.630
the customer, how deeply concerns

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.210
his needs, that, for example, employees

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.610
who work at the enterprise-buyer

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.190
are willing

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.770
to give their own function,

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.210
for example, calculating the

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.530
needs in metal and components

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.210
of another organization, understanding

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.570
that it will do it

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:55.550
better.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.610
In general, such parasitization on

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.490
the competences of the supplier leads to

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.410
the fact that the customer is very connected,

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.390
connected, because if this supplier

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.090
leaves, he will have to

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.770
develop the program himself.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.530
I am not used to doing this anymore,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.870
I am used to showing it in the best

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.790
way, for example, in a power

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.930
point before the customer's advice

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.310
in order to prevent him

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.370
from moving to our competitors.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.670
There are several ways according

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.630
to the consumer

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.570
capital model.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.930
The first is the various options

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.530
for rewarding repeated purchases.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.850
Yes, the customer understands that

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.410
if I buy the next purchase, I have some

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.950
benefits, and therefore it is not

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.590
profitable to start a new purchase

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.570
from a new competitor.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.910
The second is sponsorship programs.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:54.570
It is the provider of the sponsorship

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:55.910
program that assumes that we are

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.030
involved, for example, in some sponsorship

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.110
activities to help children, for

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.370
example, pensioners of this enterprise.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.930
We do various kinds of holidays,

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.870
sponsor, we help those who have

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.030
left the factory and much more.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.330
Second, it is a stimulation

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.150
program that allows to strengthen

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.230
the emotional attachment

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.810
of the company's consumer.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.150
I think that this emotional

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.770
attachment is often clarified

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.490
when a company begins to create

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.710
a variety of training

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.430
programs, staff development

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.690
programs.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.830
And so, for example, it is very important

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.290
in B2B is such a segment, such an

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.850
activity, such as, for example,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.570
free service workshops, invitation

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.130
to a conference, show that

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.710
we are not just selling a product,

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.170
we are developing a business,

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.510
expanding the idea, for example,

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.530
the buyer about where to go and

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.430
how to go.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.190
I have often had to speak at such

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.510
workshops, where, as a rule,

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.910
suppliers are ready for their

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.150
consumers to hold business seminars

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.510
in order to make them aware

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.990
of how to work better in the market

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.650
and how to earn more money.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.050
The supplier then is confident that

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:15.130
the sales will increase, and the

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.550
consumer will increase, and

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.030
accordingly the supplier.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.070
The last slide.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.210
And finally, as differentiation,

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.690
what differentiation should be.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.290
Differentiation in B2B is manifested

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.970
in the most unqualified, in the

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:35.070
most unqualified promotional activities,

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.330
in PR, in newspaper advertisements,

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.050
in professional press, in direct

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.390
marketing, in references, in exhibitions,

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:42.510
in brochures, audio-video

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.370
materials, in various materials

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.930
of computer order, commercial

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.470
promotion and gifts.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.350
Everywhere, from PR, we must feel

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.030
that the company is differentiated

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.110
and always reflects in these

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.610
advertising materials or in

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.710
promoting its specifics, in what

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.870
it differs from the competitor.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.110
Only then can we say that differentiation

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.070
in B2B has achieved

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.050
its result.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.810
It's difficult, but each of these

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.630
elements should bear an idea, including

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.590
a slogan that is developed based

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.490
on differentiation.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.850
I have a crown phrase

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.170
that says that all good

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.190
things end.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:30.670
I finished marketing, namely segmentation.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.070
The choice of target segments

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.850
and positioning is a very important

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.630
tool for creating confidence

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.910
that the company will continue

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.810
to exist in the market that

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.130
will not disrupt the waves of

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.810
competitive struggle.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.110
Remember my course when you have

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.610
to think about what to do with

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.790
customers, how to compete with

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.250
new players that are

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.070
coming to your market.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.870
But most importantly, this way you

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.150
get a non-standard solution

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.790
that is difficult to repeat,

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.070
because the most difficult to

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.150
repeat is the intellectual

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.070
activity of people.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.910
It is easier to repeat the products of technology.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.290
Thank you very much.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.210
Success in your business.
