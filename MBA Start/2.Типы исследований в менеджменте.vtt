00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Let's start looking at the second topic,

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
namely, the scientific methods used in management research, in business environment research.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
The reliability of the data you receive,

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
the practical significance of these results,

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
and so on.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
However, it should be noted that the choice and justification of the methodology

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
does not yet give a guarantee that you will get the right answer to the question,

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
and most importantly, the guarantee that the problem, the solution to the problem, will be accepted correctly.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
This largely depends on the people who make the decisions.

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
Nevertheless, the choice of research methods is the most important stage of planning the entire research.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
There are several ways to classify research methods,

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
but generally speaking, there are two classification signs,

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
in terms of application and in terms of the process of collecting information.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
In terms of application, general and special research methods stand out,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
and in terms of the process of collecting information, as we have already said,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
quantitative and qualitative.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
We also used the term data structure.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
It should be noted that when conducting research in a business environment,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
where the role of the human factor is very important,

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
all the increasing significance is given by qualitative research methods.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
But let's look at everything in order.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Let's start with special research methods,

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
because within the framework of this course we do not have the opportunity to consider,

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
not even within the framework of the course, but it is quite difficult to consider special methods of research in all their variety.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
Because these methods are developed and improved in completely specific situations,

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
areas of knowledge, in social, technical sciences, and so on.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
To explain what special methods are,

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
you can give a number of examples, additional to those that you have indicated in the workbook.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
If we take, for example, the industry,

02:58.000 --> 03:08.000
then there are used special methods, such as determining the norm of the investment of raw materials in a particular product,

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
determining the amount of vitamin C in a product, and so on.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
These methods are called special because they are used in a strictly specific area.

03:23.000 --> 03:32.000
If we talk about general methods of research, then they are divided into three groups.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
These are, first of all, empirical methods, that is, experimental research,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
methods that can be used both empirically and theoretically,

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
and purely theoretical methods.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
We will not pay much attention to the last aspect,

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
because these methods are used in business, but not so often.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
If we talk about methods of empirical observation,

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
then we need to focus on three of them.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
These are observation, comparison, and measurement, including experiments.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Let's start with observation.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
I will not dwell on these methods in great detail,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
let's say, on observation,

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
because you will hear about observation in addition to other courses,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
for example, organizational behavior.

04:37.000 --> 04:46.000
Nevertheless, the main principles that are characteristic not only for conducting research in the field of organizational behavior,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
but also general principles, we must consider.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So, what is observation?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
The definition is written on the slide.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
It is a system of fixing and registering the properties of the connection of the studied object

05:00.000 --> 05:09.000
in natural conditions or in artificial circumstances, that is, within the framework of the experiment.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
In fact, we are all observers in one way or another,

05:15.000 --> 05:23.000
and observing the processes, phenomena, we make certain conclusions and make decisions.

05:23.000 --> 05:32.000
Therefore, observation is one of the most common methods of research in business.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
There are two types of observation.

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
These are unstructured observations, which are also called included observations,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
and structured observations.

05:47.000 --> 05:56.000
In the first case, the researcher is inside the situation,

05:57.000 --> 06:10.000
he is studying this situation, and his task may be to clarify the problem that was originally formulated

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
or to form a working hypothesis.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
Structured observation is usually carried out to describe the repeatability,

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
the typicalness of the occurrence of one or another phenomenon, behavior, and so on.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
What is included observation?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Quoting from the textbook, we read,

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
The researcher strives to take part in the life of the participants in the study and their activities,

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
that is, he is inside the team, inside the situation.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
He strives to become a member of this group, this organization or this community.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
What is it for?

07:01.000 --> 07:12.000
In order to understand their thoughts, feelings, reactions to certain events,

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
their inner motives, which they may not tell, for example, during an interview.

07:18.000 --> 07:26.000
And all this is passed through the observer through himself,

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
through the prism of his own experiences, perceptions, emotions, and so on.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
Of course, the question arises, how unpredictable is such a method of study?

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
But this is a separate question, and we will definitely talk about it.

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
Being an observer, an included observer, the researcher can perform different roles.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
As shown on the slide.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
He can be a pure participant, a pure observer,

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
he can be a participating observer, that is, he is a participant, but also an observer,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
and can play the role of an observing participant.

08:15.000 --> 08:23.000
This method assumes, as a rule, the obtaining of high-quality data.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
That is, what will the observer describe, record?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
What he sees.

08:30.000 --> 08:39.000
And make notes, how people react to some change in the organization,

08:39.000 --> 08:49.000
to the comments of, say, the leader, how the relations between them are formed, and so on.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
What is the difference between these four roles?

08:54.000 --> 09:04.000
In the first two cases, we say that people do not know that they are being observed.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
That is, there is a so-called hidden observation.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Is it good or bad?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Which side to look at?

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
If we talk about the unpredictability, the unbiasedness of the data,

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
then for the purpose of the experiment, for the purpose of observation, for the purpose of the result,

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
it is better if people do not know that they are being observed.

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
Because nature is such that if we are being observed, we behave differently.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
In this case, the researcher can get distorted data and come to an incorrect result.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
But, there is a big but.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
And this but is on the ethical side of the matter.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
We will talk about ethics today, but nevertheless it is important to say now

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
that we are violating some human rights.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
And later on, it can make us feel some kind of complaint.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
But for the researcher, this is very important.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
In fact, he gets some kind of intelligence data, not just priceless for subsequent analysis.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
How can a hidden observation be carried out?

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
In the first case, a person simply introduces what we call a hidden Cossack.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
No one can guess that he is not one of us.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
He lives the same life, performs the same tasks as his colleagues, and so on.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
There is a danger here.

10:57.000 --> 11:09.000
In that the observer can start to prejudge certain phenomena.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
That is, he penetrates this atmosphere, he enters the position of his people around him.

11:16.000 --> 11:26.000
And there is a great danger that he will prejudge something that is happening.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
Avoiding this allows for the so-called hidden observation

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
using the technical means of hidden observation.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
When a camera is watching people.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Or you probably saw it in the movies, when an experiment is being carried out.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
Behind a transparent glass, only on one side, there are investigators,

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
and, let's say, a powerful stake of suspects is being played.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
There are, of course, some nuances here.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
In this case, such an observation is generally cleared.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
At least, the observer becomes completely independent.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
The ethical side remains the same, people are being watched.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
But this situation can be managed in modern conditions.

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
And most often in modern organizations, when a contract is signed for work,

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
one of the points is that a person is made aware in advance

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
that a hidden observation can be carried out behind him.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
For an investigator, such a contract is just a gift.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
The next two situations suggest that people know

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
that there is a person in their team who is watching them.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Thus, we solve the ethical side of the issue.

12:59.000 --> 13:08.000
But there is still such a drawback as the influence of the investigator on the participants of this study

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
and the opposite, the influence of the participants on the investigator.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
These problems can be avoided or reduced to a minimum

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
if a person has been watching people for a long enough time.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
A person gets tired of thinking about what is being watched.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
And he begins to perceive the investigator as his own.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
And then, in general, it is possible to minimize the negative consequences.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
The methods of included observation have their advantages and disadvantages.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
As, however, any method has.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
There is not a single method that we could call ideal.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
There is no ideal methodology.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
That is why we are studying a number of methods so that you can choose the best one

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
and combine them optimally to get the right result.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are described in great detail in your workbook.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Probably, we should only mention the most significant of them.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
The main advantage of this method is that it works very well

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
when you need to understand what is happening in a particular situation from the inside.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
To understand the processes that are taking place inside the team.

14:36.000 --> 14:45.000
And even sometimes not only inside the team, but inside the thinking processes.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
This is illustrated very well in the example of the Org.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
To understand the true feelings, thoughts and experiences of people.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
That is, the hidden layer can be seen only by the method of included observation.

15:03.000 --> 15:13.000
It is also important that almost all the collected data is useful in this study.

15:13.000 --> 15:23.000
Because by putting them into separate categories, you can get additional information

15:23.000 --> 15:35.000
or find some additional idea that will either provoke further research in a good sense of the word

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
in order to reduce some negative consequences in the team.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
There are also disadvantages.

15:43.000 --> 15:49.000
The first one is that it is a very long process.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
Especially when we talk about the last two.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
When people know that they are being observed.

16:00.000 --> 16:12.000
Another disadvantage is that conflict situations often arise within the framework of this method of study.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
People suddenly accidentally find out that they are being observed.

16:18.000 --> 16:26.000
A group of researchers who conduct the observation does not agree with the conflict between them.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
What I have already mentioned, by conducting the study of this method,

16:32.000 --> 16:42.000
it is very possible to distort the data due to the bias of the observer.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
Especially if it is the first two categories.

16:48.000 --> 17:00.000
The last thing to note is that data registration is a rather problematic occupation.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
Because a person, especially if we talk about the first two cases,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
cannot sit and record what he sees.

17:12.000 --> 17:20.000
That is, he must record the data registration after some time.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
This can also lead to some distortions.

17:25.000 --> 17:33.000
Something is lost in memory, something has already been seen by someone else through the prism of time.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Of course, there are methods that allow this to be avoided.

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
One of them is the recommendation to register data as soon as possible.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
People took a break, quickly recorded something.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
At the end of the working day, in no case can it be postponed.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Nevertheless, such a problem exists.

17:54.000 --> 18:06.000
In order to reduce the disadvantages, there are approaches to their minimization.

18:06.000 --> 18:20.000
Despite the cost of this method, the first thing to ask for is to include two or three researchers in the observation.

18:20.000 --> 18:28.000
The first is to duplicate the live researcher with a video camera.

18:28.000 --> 18:39.000
Then, to make a kind of average and reduce the prism of perception of each individual person.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
But you can go the other way, as you have indicated in the workbook.

18:46.000 --> 18:56.000
Having seen some observation at one workplace, you can ask the manager of this enterprise

18:56.000 --> 19:06.000
whether this phenomenon is typical only for this workplace, only for employees of this department.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
Or, in principle, this phenomenon is observed in almost the entire company.

19:12.000 --> 19:22.000
In this case, the method of observation is supplemented by the method of interview.

19:22.000 --> 19:30.000
And once again, we return to the thesis that one method may not be good enough,

19:30.000 --> 19:39.000
but its disadvantages or limitations, to put it more correctly, can be fulfilled by another method.

19:39.000 --> 19:52.000
This is why qualitative research is difficult, although quantitative research is also not free from such issues.

19:52.000 --> 20:00.000
Quantitative data obtained by one method may not always be true in the last instance.

20:00.000 --> 20:07.000
The last thesis is observation in Japanese management.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
In Japan, there is a tradition that sounds like a minaret in Russian.

20:13.000 --> 20:22.000
When the work skills are passed on by observation and copying.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
You can say it briefly, look at me and do as I do.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
This tradition is generally acceptable and widespread in Europe.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
This is what we call training at work.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
On-job training in English.

20:42.000 --> 20:56.000
But if we talk about research, then observation in Japanese management is of great importance.

20:56.000 --> 21:06.000
There is not much material written on this topic, but I think if someone is interested in this topic, you can find it.

21:06.000 --> 21:16.000
Structured observation differs from the included one in that its main goal is to obtain quantitative data.

21:16.000 --> 21:28.000
Researchers are interested in how often a particular phenomenon, event, or human action is repeated.

21:28.000 --> 21:43.000
Structured observation is not aimed at investigating the causes of this phenomenon, but at determining the periodicity of its occurrence.

21:43.000 --> 21:54.000
Since we are focusing on qualitative data, we will not go into details of structured observation.

21:54.000 --> 22:02.000
I will just say that structured observation is usually done using special techniques for recording.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
Either control sheets, or diaries, and so on.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
The next method is an empirical method.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Let me remind you that we are still looking at methods of empirical research.

22:17.000 --> 22:30.000
An experiment is an experimental study of the impact of a particular factor or group of factors on a variable researcher.

22:30.000 --> 22:43.000
That is, a certain distinguishing feature, characteristic of an object that can be changed, tracked, and measured.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Not always measured, but still.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
The types of experiments.

22:48.000 --> 22:55.000
To make it short, let me emphasize that there are two types of experiments.

22:55.000 --> 23:04.000
A laboratory experiment, or so-called true experiment, and a field experiment that is conducted in natural conditions.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
What is a good laboratory experiment?

23:10.000 --> 23:19.000
In essence, an artificial environment is created, a so-called model experiment is conducted,

23:19.000 --> 23:30.000
when the impact of external or some other factors on the variable researcher is reduced to a minimum.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
To give you an example of a true experiment, it is most often used in technical sciences.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
The crash test is probably well known to everyone.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
In essence, it is an experiment.

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
The designers have created a car, and it is necessary to assess the degree of its safety.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
It is accelerated and hit against the wall.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
And they look at the dynamics of the car's destruction, how badly these people will suffer.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
But destroying a whole car is quite an expensive pleasure.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
Therefore, in laboratory conditions, a model can be made.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
In fact, there is only one chair, the structures that surround the person,

24:15.000 --> 24:24.000
and a doll with sensors and its cover is placed in it.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
And to see what breaks at the doll's neck or leg.

24:28.000 --> 24:39.000
A field experiment is conducted in natural conditions, when the researcher does not change anything in the surrounding environment.

24:39.000 --> 24:50.000
This experiment is quite complex, because the system is very multifaceted, but also very informative and effective.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
What should be noted?

24:52.000 --> 25:01.000
An experiment can be carried out, as it is good for obtaining quantitative data, for example,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
the time to develop equipment for failure.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
What is it?

25:05.000 --> 25:12.000
They have developed a new telephone device, they have given it to a person to use,

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
and he must hand it over when it breaks.

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
If they gave it to 100 people, then you can already draw some statistical conclusions,

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
that on average it will serve 2 years, and then it is not needed.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
But the experiment is also good because it allows you to obtain qualitative characteristics.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
For example, if you study people's reaction to changes.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
It is difficult to record, but the experiment is very useful.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
There are several schemes for conducting experiments.

25:53.000 --> 26:01.000
I will not go through all these schemes, they are presented in detail in the workbook.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
What should be noted?

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
We are operating in two categories.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
This is an experimental group and a control group.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Why?

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Why should there be an experimental group and a control group?

26:19.000 --> 26:26.000
An experimental group is the one that is affected by something,

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
to see what response this effect will have.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
In any case, for an experimental group,

26:36.000 --> 26:48.000
the assessment of the quality or quantitative state of the experimental group is carried out before the start of the study and after.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
Sometimes immediately after and significantly after.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
What is the need of a control group?

26:56.000 --> 27:06.000
I think that for you it is not a discovery that people, participating in experiments, change their behavior.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
A fact known from medicine.

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
If a person is given a candy and told that this is a pill that will reduce heart pain,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
it is called placebo,

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
then indeed their heart will hurt less.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
Moreover, the more a person is affected by the influence of other people,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
psychologically dependent,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
the higher the effect will be.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
To level this influence,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
the person's awareness that he is participating in an experiment,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
a control group is required.

27:41.000 --> 27:48.000
In a control group, measurements or data collection can be carried out before the start of the experiment

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
and after the experiment where we carry out the effect.

27:54.000 --> 28:02.000
Measurements and data collection can be carried out only after the experiment is over.

28:02.000 --> 28:12.000
Experiments can be carried out in social groups and in the business environment.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
Although this can be coupled with certain difficulties,

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
because people do not always want to participate in experiments

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
and very often resist this.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
The next method of empirical research is comparison.

28:31.000 --> 28:42.000
That is, you need to establish with this method the common thing that is inherent in two or several objects.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
I think that everyone knows this saying.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
Everything is known in comparison.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
But if we talk about the reliability of this method,

28:55.000 --> 29:05.000
then it is necessary to take into account the two main requirements that you have here.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
The first is that only such phenomena should be compared

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
between which there is a certain objective community.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
There is no point in comparing, say, an elephant and a fly.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
Although, what to choose for a unit of comparison?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
And the second is that for the identification of objects,

29:28.000 --> 29:38.000
the comparison should be carried out according to the most important objective significant signs.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And not in general.

29:40.000 --> 29:49.000
It is also important to note that both quantitative and qualitative characteristics can be compared.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
This is absolutely fair.

29:51.000 --> 29:58.000
That is, we can compare, say, the flow of personnel at a Moscow enterprise

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
and the flow of personnel in a branch in the region and look for reasons.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
But we can also compare the qualitative characteristics.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
This also has the right to exist.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
What else should be added here?

30:16.000 --> 30:24.000
As an addition to the method of comparison, there is also a method of contrast.

30:24.000 --> 30:34.000
When in objects the corresponding characteristics are assessed, and their opposites.

30:34.000 --> 30:41.000
This is also a fair method for finding solutions.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Measurement.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
We will touch on the measurement literally through,

30:47.000 --> 30:58.000
because it is the main prerogative of quantitative methods of determination.

30:58.000 --> 31:07.000
That is, there is a procedure for determining the numerical value of a certain value.

31:07.000 --> 31:19.000
And this numerical value is determined by comparing the units of measurement and the object of study.

31:19.000 --> 31:32.000
This procedure is very important because it allows you to get very accurate quantitative data about the surrounding reality.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
The data obtained can be statistically processed,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
and the dependence can be identified, and so on.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
But this will be told in detail in the lecture on quantitative methods of study.

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
And here we move on to the next group of general methods of study.

31:54.000 --> 32:03.000
We will list the methods that can be used both empirically and theoretically.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
There are quite a few of them.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
Abstraction, analysis-synthesis, induction-deduction, and so on.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
The first of the listed is abstraction.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
What is abstraction?

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
I think that all of you have heard this term.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
But for our purposes, we must consider two aspects.

32:23.000 --> 32:30.000
There is the concept of the process of abstraction and the result of abstraction.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
What is abstraction?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
What does it mean to abstract?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
You have probably heard this term.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
To abstract from circumstances.

32:41.000 --> 32:52.000
That is, to highlight the essential, important, central thing that should be assessed.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
That is, to simplify the complex.

32:56.000 --> 33:12.000
But what you leave in your abstraction should be absolutely unharmful to the object you tried to abstract.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
What is it for?

33:14.000 --> 33:23.000
To simplify the process of assessment and study of the object itself.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
What can you abstract from in the business environment?

33:28.000 --> 33:35.000
If you study, let's say, the motivation of employees,

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
you are not interested in motivation at all,

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
and the motivation is only material,

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
then you can abstract from the non-material.

33:50.000 --> 34:04.000
If you continue, you can move away the non-essential, which is not important for your analysis,

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
and focus only on the key points.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
Unfortunately, this is not a method used so often.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
It is complex and sometimes very subjective.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
The next method is analysis and synthesis.

34:23.000 --> 34:33.000
This method is practically the main, triangular one in any study.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
What is analysis?

34:36.000 --> 34:48.000
Analysis is the decomposition of the object into components, as shown in the following slide.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
But to decompose a whole into components,

34:52.000 --> 34:59.000
you need to highlight certain features of individual elements of a whole.

34:59.000 --> 35:08.000
By decomposing into components, each of them must be analyzed separately,

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
significant interconnections must be highlighted,

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
and then synthesis must be carried out.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
It turns out that synthesis is a process of reverse analysis.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
But pay attention to the diagram.

35:24.000 --> 35:32.000
In a synthesized object, we already have fewer elements,

35:32.000 --> 35:42.000
and we have otherwise organized their structure, their interconnections.

35:42.000 --> 35:51.000
This allows us to build our conclusions more correctly, to come to certain conclusions.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Induction and deduction.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
We have talked about this a lot.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
What should be noted here?

35:59.000 --> 36:09.000
It is very important that the induction and deduction lead to the same results.

36:09.000 --> 36:17.000
If the inductively conducted study contradicts the theory,

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
or if the data you have collected does not confirm the theory,

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
then there are two possible outcomes of the situation.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
Either you conducted the study incorrectly, or you made a discovery.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Historical and logical methods.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
Historically, they are also called the archival method.

36:41.000 --> 36:48.000
That is, it is the study of the history of events in all their complexity,

36:48.000 --> 36:55.000
of course, with the exception of those elements that interest the researcher.

36:55.000 --> 37:03.000
The logical method differs from the historical one in that it also studies history,

37:04.000 --> 37:12.000
but it studies the logic of the occurrence of certain events, the course of certain events.

37:12.000 --> 37:21.000
This is also a kind of abstraction, that is, the logic of the history of events

37:21.000 --> 37:33.000
is cleared of randomness, turns, zigzags that may coincide with the study of the event.

37:33.000 --> 37:40.000
Modeling is a very important method of study.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
What is a model?

37:43.000 --> 37:51.000
You can say that it is an analogue of a real object, or a phenomenon, or a process.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
But you need to be very careful.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
A model and an analogue are completely different concepts.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
There can be a lot of analogues,

38:05.000 --> 38:14.000
but this does not mean that analogues repeat the main significant aspects of the object being studied.

38:14.000 --> 38:24.000
But a model repeats the main significant aspects of the object being studied.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
In principle, there are physical models, which we most often call models,

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
and there are abstract models.

38:34.000 --> 38:47.000
These can be sign systems, language models, virtual models, or mathematical models.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
Modeling is very widespread in research.

38:51.000 --> 38:59.000
Your workbook gives an example of how website creators work.

38:59.000 --> 39:06.000
When creating a website, a model is first of all created.

39:06.000 --> 39:13.000
It is not filled with all kinds of pictograms, links, and so on.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
The model has only the basic working tools.

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
This allows website developers to check, for example, how interfaces work,

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
how convenient it is for users to work with this website, and so on.

39:30.000 --> 39:39.000
When this model website is finished, it can be filled with other elements,

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
which may be less meaningful.

39:44.000 --> 39:51.000
In principle, a model can be called what I told you about crash tests.

39:51.000 --> 39:59.000
But in business, a certain scheme is often understood as a model.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
The next slide shows a model of strategic management.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
One of the possible ones, there are quite a few of them.

40:09.000 --> 40:18.000
Please note that the model shows the key aspects of strategic management.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
The basis of the basis is a business idea,

40:22.000 --> 40:29.000
around which target installations are formed,

40:29.000 --> 40:36.000
and then the development of all aspects of strategic management.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
The model of synthesis analysis was previously presented on the previous slide.

40:42.000 --> 40:50.000
There are so-called portfolio models in strategic management.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
What are the advantages of models?

40:53.000 --> 41:01.000
They are good because they allow you to study elements very well.

41:01.000 --> 41:14.000
They structure the course of thought and clearly and visually show you the structure of the object or subject of research.

41:14.000 --> 41:21.000
In principle, the creation of a model can be the goal of research.

41:21.000 --> 41:33.000
You can create a model of relationships with the management of your organization by conducting research.

41:33.000 --> 41:43.000
For example, I think that you will read about idealization, formalization and axiomatic method in your workbook.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
These methods are not used so often in the business environment.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
And we are moving on.

41:52.000 --> 42:00.000
Finally, we will discuss the topic of qualitative methods of research in business.

42:00.000 --> 42:09.000
We have already considered some of these methods, but we need to deepen and expand this information.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
First of all, it should be noted that qualitative and quantitative methods are by no means competitors.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
The difference between them is significant.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
Quantitative methods allow us to give a numerical assessment of events,

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
and qualitative methods allow us to give an assessment of events,

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
give a characteristic of what is happening, and so on.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
In one research, both qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis can be used.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
What precedes what?

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
In fact, it depends on how you have built your research.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Quantitative data can be collected,

42:54.000 --> 43:07.000
and in order to fully analyze and understand them, additional qualitative studies can be conducted for explanation.

43:07.000 --> 43:15.000
But it is quite possible that when qualitative studies are collected,

43:15.000 --> 43:20.000
a characteristic of the situation, object, phenomenon, and so on is given,

43:20.000 --> 43:26.000
which requires additional quantitative information.

43:26.000 --> 43:36.000
As we have already said, maybe we need to look at how often this phenomenon appears in a particular group, and so on.

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
Quantitative and qualitative methods are complementary.

43:42.000 --> 43:53.000
Nevertheless, qualitative methods are very common in business and differ in some characteristics.

43:53.000 --> 44:03.000
First of all, qualitative methods of research imply the collection of information in a free form,

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
that is, there is no specific structure.

44:07.000 --> 44:18.000
It is important that they rely on understanding and explanation of empirical data collected by a researcher.

44:18.000 --> 44:25.000
They serve as a source for forming hypotheses and some productive ideas.

44:25.000 --> 44:35.000
At the same time, qualitative studies can be used to collect information about bias, motivations, values, and so on.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
For example, when conducting marketing research,

44:39.000 --> 44:52.000
motives that incline people to buy this, not another product, to approach this brand, not another one, can be studied.

44:52.000 --> 45:01.000
Because they prefer one type of service, let's say, in a restaurant, and not another.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
What else is very important?

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
Qualitative data allows us to understand the essence of the problem.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
Since we have talked about the study, explanatory type of research,

45:13.000 --> 45:19.000
then by studying the variety of elements and situations,

45:19.000 --> 45:29.000
we can thus create a base for subsequent quantitative research and quantitative assessment.

45:30.000 --> 45:38.000
As I have already said, qualitative research can be studied in quantitative ways,

45:38.000 --> 45:47.000
in this case, by performing the function of explaining the obtained quantitative data.

45:47.000 --> 45:55.000
The methods of qualitative research include interviews, focus groups, observations, and experiments.

45:55.000 --> 46:04.000
We have already talked about observations and experiments when we talked about general methods of research.

46:04.000 --> 46:15.000
Therefore, now we will focus on the interview and the variety of interviews, which is called focus groups.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
What is an interview?

46:17.000 --> 46:27.000
In fact, it is a purposeful discussion or conversation between two or more people,

46:27.000 --> 46:35.000
which is aimed at obtaining certain types of information from these people.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
There are three types of interviews.

46:38.000 --> 46:45.000
These are structured interviews, partially structured, and unstructured interviews,

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
which are also called deep interviews.

46:49.000 --> 46:56.000
Let's look at each of these types of interviews separately.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
A structured interview is a standardized procedure,

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
which is most often carried out by using surveys.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
What is a survey?

47:08.000 --> 47:18.000
It is a form with a certain number of questions.

47:18.000 --> 47:29.000
These questions are asked to all participants who are subject to this method of analysis.

47:29.000 --> 47:37.000
The example of a structured interview is shown in the application for the workbook.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
It is a fairly long document to talk about it here,

47:41.000 --> 47:48.000
but pay attention to how people who have passed a structured interview respond.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
One opinion was expressed that a structured interview is similar to a survey.

47:53.000 --> 48:00.000
You are asked a question, you are listened to, and you are asked the next question,

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
which is not related to the previous one and your answer to the previous question.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Why is this done?

48:07.000 --> 48:19.000
The thing is that the quality methods of research are mostly developed by psychologists.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
And the way a person responds to a question, for example, can be asked,

48:26.000 --> 48:32.000
tell me, please, a funny story from your life.

48:32.000 --> 48:42.000
A person tells a story, and the listener pays attention to his emotionality,

48:42.000 --> 48:50.000
to his ability to creatively process some information, to non-verbal signs,

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
if we are talking about a personal structured interview, not a survey.

48:56.000 --> 49:03.000
A structured interview is most often used to collect quantitative data.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Why?

49:05.000 --> 49:19.000
Because in addition to this questionnaire, there are developed methods of pain evaluation of the respondent's answer.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
The interviewer asks a question, and the questioner says,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
the questioner does not understand the meaning of the question,

49:26.000 --> 49:35.000
but the researcher has a methodology of evaluation of the respondent's emotionality,

49:35.000 --> 49:44.000
the person's stress resistance, the level of truthfulness or not.

49:44.000 --> 49:55.000
And so you can sum up the number of points, like in a psychological test.

49:55.000 --> 50:04.000
This method works very well, it allows to make a very large coverage of the interview,

50:04.000 --> 50:12.000
especially if it is not a personal survey, but is used mainly to get quantitative information.

50:12.000 --> 50:22.000
Unlike structured interviews, a partially structured interview should have a list of topics,

50:22.000 --> 50:29.000
not questions, like in a structured interview, but topics for discussion.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Topics and questions.

50:32.000 --> 50:40.000
The main difference from a structured interview is that in the process of an interview,

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
topics and questions can change.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
That is, the interviewer can, by the course of the interview,

50:50.000 --> 50:57.000
based on the respondent's answer, change the course of the interview.

50:57.000 --> 51:10.000
Let's say the respondent shows some impatience or irritation from the questions.

51:10.000 --> 51:19.000
The researcher can change the tone, the order of the questions,

51:19.000 --> 51:29.000
or exclude some topics of a personal nature that the respondent is affected by from this interview.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
And, accordingly, change the direction of the conversation.

51:33.000 --> 51:43.000
Partially structured and unstructured interviews are intended for quality research.

51:43.000 --> 51:53.000
That is, the researcher needs to understand the feeling, the experience, the motivation, and so on.

51:53.000 --> 52:04.000
The reaction to certain events, in order to answer the research question later.

52:05.000 --> 52:13.000
An unstructured interview or a deep interview is always informal.

52:13.000 --> 52:20.000
The researcher usually does not have a list of questions prepared in advance,

52:20.000 --> 52:29.000
but he must clearly imagine what problems he wants to study.

52:30.000 --> 52:38.000
And he already formulates the questions as the respondent answers them.

52:38.000 --> 52:46.000
It is quite possible that in the course of an unstructured interview, new problems will be revealed,

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
which will be subject to further study or research.

52:52.000 --> 53:05.000
An unstructured interview is very often conducted with people who are in a high position in society or in business,

53:05.000 --> 53:12.000
and do not want everyone to know what they are talking about in this interview.

53:12.000 --> 53:19.000
That is, it is a personal conversation between the researcher and the respondent.

53:19.000 --> 53:25.000
But a deep interview is a very powerful research tool,

53:25.000 --> 53:32.000
which allows to reveal what is not available to almost no other method.

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
Let's look at the typology of quality research, which is presented on the diagram.

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
A quality interview can be individual, or it can be conducted with a group of people.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
Individual interviews can be conducted in person, that is, eye to eye,

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
or they can be conducted by phone.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
This is also a very useful method.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Group interviews are allocated to a separate category,

54:01.000 --> 54:10.000
which are conducted with a group of people, and are called a focus group.

54:11.000 --> 54:22.000
The problems of the quality of the collected data as a result of the interview generally require discussion.

54:22.000 --> 54:29.000
First of all, there is a question of the reliability of the data obtained.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
What is reliability?

54:32.000 --> 54:46.000
It is that these data can be relied on, and these data can be obtained again if the interview is repeated.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
Unfortunately, when we talk about collecting quality data,

54:51.000 --> 54:57.000
very often nothing can be repeated.

54:57.000 --> 55:06.000
Therefore, we must take care of ensuring the reliability of the data from the first time.

55:06.000 --> 55:12.000
Since the situation in business changes very quickly,

55:12.000 --> 55:26.000
it is necessary to recommend to the researcher to register absolutely all the collected data,

55:26.000 --> 55:33.000
so that if there is a doubt about the reliability of these data,

55:33.000 --> 55:42.000
it would be possible to upload a record archive and justify the conclusions made,

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
or, so to speak, to see where and how additional research can be carried out

55:49.000 --> 55:55.000
to further justify the conclusions made.

55:56.000 --> 56:04.000
The assurance of the reliability of the data is directly related to the prejudice of collecting data.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
Moreover, this prejudice can be twofold.

56:07.000 --> 56:16.000
The prejudice of the participant of the interview and the prejudice of the interviewer.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
If we talk about the prejudice of the interviewer,

56:20.000 --> 56:28.000
the researcher must be internally ready to avoid this,

56:28.000 --> 56:34.000
and must treat exactly those whom he is asking.

56:34.000 --> 56:42.000
As for the prejudice of the participants, it can be related to a number of reasons.

56:42.000 --> 56:50.000
One of the reasons for the prejudice is that very often the person who is being asked

56:50.000 --> 56:56.000
assumes what they want to hear from him,

56:56.000 --> 57:07.000
and builds his answer in such a way as to satisfy the interviewer in the best way.

57:07.000 --> 57:15.000
He can also think that what I am going to say now will be told to my boss,

57:15.000 --> 57:25.000
and therefore he tries to change his answer a little, as if he said it without thinking about it.

57:28.000 --> 57:35.000
The prejudice of the interview participant can also be related to some personal issues.

57:35.000 --> 57:44.000
If the questions of the interviewer are related to some personal issues in his life,

57:44.000 --> 57:55.000
the person can go into a deaf defense and not answer the question correctly.

57:55.000 --> 58:02.000
Here good skills of the interviewer must be shown.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
He must be a good psychologist, he must read the non-verbal signs well,

58:08.000 --> 58:13.000
which the interview participant gives him,

58:13.000 --> 58:23.000
in order to stop in time, change the topic, rephrase the question, and get away from such problems.

58:23.000 --> 58:31.000
Another prejudice can be related to the group interviews.

58:31.000 --> 58:42.000
The interviewer does not want to give an answer in the presence of the third person.

58:42.000 --> 58:59.000
This problem can also be avoided if the researcher plans and forms the composition of people

58:59.000 --> 59:05.000
who will participate in the group interview.

59:05.000 --> 59:11.000
The next point is to provide validity and possibility of data generalization.

59:11.000 --> 59:18.000
It is difficult to overestimate the importance of qualitative data, it is very important.

59:18.000 --> 59:26.000
However, it is not easy to generalize qualitative data.

59:26.000 --> 59:33.000
If the interview was not conducted at the representative election,

59:33.000 --> 59:39.000
then the generalization may be completely unfair.

59:39.000 --> 59:46.000
And in general, to generalize qualitative data is a rather complicated problem.

59:47.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the interviews very carefully and select the participants for the future interview.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:08.000
A very important point of the interview is to set the questions.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
First of all, it is necessary to say that there are two types of questions.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
These are open questions and closed questions.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Open questions are good because they allow the interview participant to describe the situation in his own words,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
using his vocabulary, using his thoughts, feelings, and so on.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Open questions usually start with the words how and why.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
How do you see the future of our company?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Why do you think we need to develop a branch network? And so on.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Closed questions assume that the information should be clear or that a certain fact is confirmed.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Usually, questions are asked in such a way that the person either gives an assessment of the event or simply says yes or no.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Is it true that the new warehouse of ready-made products was opened in March? Yes or no.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And there is nothing else here.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Closed questions, by the way, can be used if a large number of interviews have been conducted,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:48.000
subject to some statistical processing and get some quantitative characteristic of the studied phenomenon or event.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Since the interview is conducted for a long time, and we are talking about the reliability of qualitative studies,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
a separate emphasis should be placed on the registration of data.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And there are three possible situations.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The first one is that the researcher is recording during the interview.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Is it good or bad? It depends on the situation.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:32.000
If the situation allows, it is better to record directly during the interview.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000
To facilitate the task, you can prepare a tablet, divided into two, with a piece of paper.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Each of you can have your own method, divided into two graphs.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It is impossible to record and interview simultaneously.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
You can make short notes in the graph, what the person said and what you thought about it.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And then you can sit down and think it over.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000
When you have a canvas, it is quite easy to restructure it.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:18.000
If there is no such possibility, the researcher should understand by the reaction of the person he is asking.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
If he sees that the person does not like that something is being recorded,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
it is better to avoid this situation, to put it on your memory,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:38.000
and to sit down and record the whole interview in detail right after the person has left.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Of course, this is not the best option.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
There can be some overlays.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
The next way to register data is to make a wall.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:03.000
When a specially trained person records in detail what the researcher said,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
what the researcher asked, and what the interview participant said.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Recently, this method is used very rarely,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:23.000
because our technical development has reached such heights that we can afford to use a dictaphone.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
A dictaphone is a very good and convenient thing.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000
It allows you to record all questions and answers.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But using a dictaphone does not exclude recording.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Because you cannot see any non-verbal signs on the dictaphone.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And they can be extremely important when analyzing the received information.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000
In your workbook, you have a table that illustrates in great detail the advantages and disadvantages of a dictaphone.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I will not go into details, but I will definitely mention one thing.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
There is an ethical side to using a dictaphone.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
What a researcher should do, from the ethical point of view,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:28.000
is to ask for the permission of the interview participant to use a dictaphone.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
If the interview participant does not agree with the use of a dictaphone,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:43.000
the researcher should be ready to record the information in any other way.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
But using a dictaphone is not a panacea.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Because decoding a recording from a dictaphone is also a very difficult task.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Telephone interviews.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000
In what cases can telephone interviews be used?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:22.000
As a rule, the advantage of a telephone interview is that it is very accessible to a remote participant.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Let's say you want to interview or ask questions, working in a head office,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
to managers of all regional subsidiaries of yours,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
which are located in different parts of the world.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It is expensive and long to go there.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000
It is much easier to call and ask this question or a number of questions on the phone.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It is cheap and fast.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Relatively cheap, compared to the cost of a plane ticket.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But telephone interviews have a number of limitations.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:20.000
The first of the limitations is that it is impossible to control the information received by the interviewee.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
This is very important.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Because it can lead to a misunderstanding of the situation, to misplacing the emphasis, and so on.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Of course, you can guess by the voice about some things.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000
For example, the degree of irritation of a person, the degree of his kindness.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Not for nothing, there is such a phrase in English literature as a smiling voice.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That is, on the phone, by the sound of a voice, it is clear whether a person is smiling or sitting with a grimace.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
But, nevertheless, this is a very strong limitation.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000
In addition, telephone interviews are extremely not recommended to be conducted with people

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
with whom you have not had personal contact before.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Because it can distort the information you receive.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Only after meeting a person in person, it is desirable to agree with this person

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000
that if I have additional questions, I can call you on the phone.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000
This will be ethical and correct in terms of receiving reliable information.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:10.000
If necessary, you can call on the phone, but it is better to make this phone call with some permission, and so on.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And we have to discuss the focus group.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000
As already mentioned, the focus group is a group interview, that is, with several participants.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:33.000
In this case, the researcher performs the role of a moderator, that is, the organizer of a group discussion.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Usually, such an interview is not structured, and the direction of the discussion is not controlled.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Only certain aspects of the topic to be discussed are highlighted.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
This is a high-quality method of gathering information.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It allows to reveal different opinions, different understanding of the same problem to different people,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
to understand how different phenomena are perceived by certain groups of people,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:21.000
and its task is to determine the real attitude and view of people on a particular issue.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:30.000
But a group interview can be structured, partially structured,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000
when the moderator has a certain set of questions,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and those that must be discussed in this group.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:49.000
What is important and necessary to know about the focus group?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:58.000
First of all, you need to pay attention to the selection of people to participate in the focus group.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
This is very important.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It is important to have a personal psychological compatibility between people who will participate.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It is undesirable to invite the leaders and subordinates to one focus group,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:29.000
because the latter can express their attitude to the discussed problem in a slightly different way in the presence of the leadership, and so on.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It is very important to pay attention to the place of the focus group.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Focus groups are usually not big.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The practice shows that 7-10 people are optimal.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Why so many?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Because if the number of people becomes larger,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000
then, first of all, the researcher, the moderator, cannot monitor the entire audience.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Some people just sit passively and do not participate in the discussion.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:15.000
If there are fewer participants, then the focus group is actually transformed into a personal interview.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:28.000
The main advantage of the focus group is to hear different points of view on the discussed problem,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.000
to understand different attitudes of people to the same discussed problem, and so on.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
If we talk about the place of the focus group,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
it is better to do it on the neutral territory.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Neutral in quotation marks.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It means not in the office of the leader, where the subordinates may feel constrained.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:08.000
In principle, the ideal option is to have a separate room.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:16.000
For example, in the company, it can be a room for negotiations,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
which is neutral for all participants,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:30.000
for the leader, if he is going to be invited, and for all other employees.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:41.000
It is desirable that this room has the possibility to record audio and video.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And we move on to the aspect of data registration in the focus group process.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
The possible forms of recording.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
There are three options.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:04.000
If there are no technical means of recording, then there are only two options.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Ideally, two people should conduct the focus group.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
One performs the role of a moderator, the other leads the recording in parallel.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Since it is almost impossible to talk to an audience of 7-10 people and still have time to record something.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
If there is no second person, then, as in the case of an individual interview,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:43.000
the moderator must make all the recordings immediately after the end of the group interview.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And the ideal option is to record everything that is happening using audio or video technology.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
What can be noted here?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
First, it is necessary to ask from the point of view of ethics,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
do people have permission to conduct audio or video technology.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
This has already become a standard procedure.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
You can't get away from this.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And here, by the way, the issue of reliability of data collection is reflected.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:28.000
If we force people to conduct the focus group,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and also remove them, we will get answers that will take us very far from the real situation.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And then we will not get reliable data.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But here is the same problem that we discussed about the dictaphone.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Deciphering these recordings is also a difficult task.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
It is time-consuming, and so on.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I will emphasize once again that there are no perfect methods, but reliability must be ensured.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Therefore, when conducting qualitative studies,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.000
a method is now adopted called triangulation.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
In translation from Latin, it is a triangle.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That is, using the advantages of one method,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:36.000
by combining methods, we can level the shortcomings of another

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and ensure the reliability of our results.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Triangulation is a method of checking and improving the reliability and interpretation of data in a qualitative study.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:00.000
This method of checking comes to us from technical science, namely from geodesy.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:13.000
There is a method of triangles that allows us to accurately determine the coordinates of a point on the terrain.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And we need to ensure absolute and accurate fixation of our data.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
There are four types of triangulation.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Three of them absolutely must be used in a qualitative study.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:44.000
We list them as data triangulation, researchers' triangulation, methodological triangulation, and theory triangulation.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
If we talk about theory triangulation,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:59.000
then using the triangulation method itself is the best example of how this method works.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000
As I said, it came from geodesy business research.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:17.000
The same way, theory triangulation is the use of marketing theory, let's say, management of people,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
and use it for research in the field of finance, for example.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:32.000
That is, it is the use of theory from interrelated sciences in your research.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Data triangulation is very simple.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
This is what we have just talked about.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Data must be obtained in several ways that complement each other and ensure the reliability of the result.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Data triangulation means that we must use data for confirmation of a research hypothesis or answer to a research question,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000
both quantitative and qualitative research.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Research triangulation is somewhat different and not always possible.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Research triangulation is possible when there is a group of researchers.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Regardless of each other, they receive certain data, as we said a little earlier in the example,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:56.000
and then sit down together and compare the data obtained, making certain adjustments or conducting additional research.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:05.000
But if there is only one researcher, then it is impossible to triangulate researchers.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Therefore, methodological triangulation is very important for him,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:19.000
that is, the use of different methods to obtain qualitative data.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:29.000
If a researcher has managed to conduct this triangulation principle in his research,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:37.000
then it increases the validity of his research and, I think, practical significance.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:44.000
The collected data must be processed and analyzed.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:59.000
It is important to note that the question of analyzing qualitative data should be raised at the time of making a plan for future research.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:06.000
That is, while planning the methods you will use to collect data,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:14.000
you need to think about how you will analyze them later during the research.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:23.000
If it is assumed that you will get information that is very diverse, difficult to classify,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:34.000
then you need to think in advance about several other sources of information, methods of collecting this information, and so on.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:44.000
We have already discussed that the analysis of qualitative data can and should be carried out at the stage of collecting information,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:59.000
because it can contribute to the emergence of new ideas, to the change of the direction of research, and maybe even to the return to the original position.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:13.000
The next feature of the analysis of qualitative data is that standardized schemes cannot be used for their analysis.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:29.000
This is always a creative, flexible approach to analysis, although there are certain methods of analyzing qualitative data.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:39.000
These methods can be divided into several stages or include the following operations.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:52.000
First of all, this is the division of all data into separate categories and groups according to a certain characteristic, a separate characteristic.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:02.000
But in this case, the researcher's skill and ability to identify a characteristic characteristic should also be shown,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:08.000
according to which the data will be grouped into separate categories.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.000
This method exists in different categories.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:28.000
In principle, you can assign a certain code to each category and even do some kind of machine processing.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:38.000
The data processed in this way can be combined into the so-called information unit,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:47.000
again, in the same way as in another discipline of logistics, which has the concept of a cargo unit,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:56.000
that is, the combination of homogeneous items into one unit of accounting.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I think you all bought some products with a small option and saw how 6 bottles of Coca-Cola were soldered into the film.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
This will be the cargo unit.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And for us, you and I, in research, in business, we will have to form such an information unit,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:31.000
consisting of data that contains approximately homogeneous information.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:42.000
After we have divided our data into categories, the next step must be carried out,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.000
that is, to identify the interconnection between certain categories.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Because in a separate form, they will not benefit us in any way.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:06.000
And only by identifying the interconnection between them, we can develop a system of categories

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and implement what we talked about in the synthesis.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Next, we need to check the hypotheses in order to come to conclusions.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I will emphasize the word conclusions right away.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:37.000
The conclusions must be based strictly on the information, on the data that you received and described in your report.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Very often, the conclusion is not based on the described, analyzed material,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:56.000
one of the most standard mistakes, but on the fact that the researcher has, let's say, three, write, two in mind.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000
He builds one of the conclusions on the research problem based on these two in mind.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
This should not be done.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
How can we group the data we receive?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Most often, we do it by the moments listed below, by events, by people, let's say, by gender, by age, by products, materials.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Let's say, we will talk about the Chepchiks, about the space vehicles, and so on.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
About resources, costs, and income.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000
So, grouping is not an exhaustive list.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It can be supplemented depending on what has been studied.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And just like in the end of the first topic, in the end of the second topic, you will find questions and tasks for self-checking.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Once again, scroll through your workbook and try to work through this task.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And after that, we will move on to the last topic, the third topic, ethics in management research.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Ethics in management research

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
How important are ethics in management research?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:58.000
When we talk about ethics, we think about medicine, but ethics in management research is becoming more and more important.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And although there is no such rule as what it means to conduct ethical management research or business research,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.000
nevertheless, there is a reason to discuss these issues.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
What is ethics?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:25.000
These are questions about the development of moral norms, which can help to assess the situation.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:41.000
These are the moral values that a person has or does not have, which can be violated, and so on.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:50.000
As a rule, ethics norms precede the norms of the law.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Each of us, one way or another, assesses whether we have acted ethically in relation to the law or not.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:10.000
When a researcher plans his research, he must ask himself the same question.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000
How ethical will it be to ask a researcher a question?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:23.000
How ethical will it be to involve him in this research? And so on.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Ethics norms are aimed at warning of the problems that may arise.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But the laws are written as a rule.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
When there is a precedent, it was violated and the law was passed.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
That is, after a certain event has occurred.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
The parable of the Voivodess has probably already become a case.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:01.000
It may not be related to ethics, but it illustrates very well how something is written after the fact.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:11.000
After an American grandmother washed her dog in a washing machine, and another one dried her dog in a microwave,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:23.000
we can now read the instructions on how to use the equipment that are not familiar to us.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Recently, when I bought a frying pan, I read that it is not recommended to put a handle on the front of the stove,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
so that the child running past does not push it on himself.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It would seem that's all.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
But back to the questions of ethics.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
What are the ethical limits?

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:58.000
At the moment, two ethical aspects are being considered.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:07.000
This is deontology, or otherwise the principle of rights and the principle of justice, and teleology.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
What is deontology?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
It is based on two criteria of the assessment of activity.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
The first is universality and the second is appeal.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
What does universality mean?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:34.000
It means that everyone should be treated equally, without infringing on someone's rights or giving someone their incentives.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:47.000
The principle of appeal says that people should be treated the way you would like them to be treated.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Then it is believed that moral norms will be observed from the point of view of deontology.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.000
This is from the point of view of the principle of rights.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:11.000
But from the point of view of the principle of justice, three categories are distinguished.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Distributive, punishing and compensating.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
What is distributive?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It means that everyone should be treated equally.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Distributive means that everyone should be treated equally.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Punishing means that if a person acted unethically, violated someone's rights, he should be punished accordingly.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:04.000
The compensating category says that if the principle of justice in relation to the participant in this case of the study was violated,

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:10.000
then a person has the right to be compensated.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:27.000
If the participant in the study's rights were violated, for example, his right to be heard, his right to receive additional information,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:35.000
then the researcher must somehow compensate for the damage done.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Deontology is the principle of the benefit of the person.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It is the theory of benefit for the person.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It is important to understand that morally, ethically, deontology is something that does not cause damage to a person.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Let's take an example.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:27.000
A country is fighting for democracy in another small country.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000
From the point of view of the principle of common good, it seems that they are doing well.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:49.000
But if we think about those hundreds and thousands of people with a damaged fate or who no longer exist in this world,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000
then from the point of view of deontology, these actions are immoral.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:01.000
If we return to the business of research, what principle should we profess?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Deontology or teleology?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
We have not yet talked about teleology, but let's answer the question for ourselves.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Should we apply the principle of deontology in governance studies or not?

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:28.000
We should take care of the moral behavior of the researcher towards each participant,

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:38.000
regardless of the benefits that may be obtained as a result of infringement of the rights of these participants.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Unfortunately, the answer to this question can be twofold.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:36:01.000
From the point of view of high theory and high ethics, governance studies should be conducted in such a way

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
that no participant is harmed.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:17.000
But unfortunately, this principle is often ignored in real business situations.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:30.000
In the best case, we are talking about the compensating category of the deontological principle of ethics.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:41.000
If a participant says that his rights were violated, then he is compensated.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
What is teleology?

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:55.000
In this area, we often talk about utilitarianism.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000
This is the principle of the common good.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
The formula is as follows.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:21.000
If the total effect of the action, for example, the study, is positive,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000
then the action is considered moral.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:39.000
But the fact that certain individuals suffered, that they were harmed, is not taken into account.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
This is the principle of the common good.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:57.000
If we return to the example of small and large countries, then the principle of utilitarianism is also mentioned here.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Your notebook contains two examples with explanations of the actions of the sheriff and the actions of the president of the company,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:15.000
which clearly illustrate the above two principles.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Which of them will you be guided by in your studies?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:37.000
This is your right, your moral values, but in the modern world it is still desirable to profess the principles of deontology.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Other problems in terms of ethics may arise in interpersonal relations and in the relationship between the researcher and the participants in the study,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:04.000
with colleagues in conducting the study, the researcher and his leadership.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Let's start with the leader.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:15.000
First of all, it should be borne in mind that if you conduct a study with permission or at the request of the leadership,

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:34.000
then the leader is partially responsible for the order of conducting the study, including for violating the norms of ethics and rights.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Well, if you conduct an unauthorized study, then in case of your mistake, the full responsibility will be entirely and completely on you.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Do not let your leader down.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:02.000
The next aspect is the relationship between the researcher and his colleagues in conducting the study.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Here, too, the boundaries of the norms of ethics may be crossed,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:22.000
first of all, in the research approaches, in the coordination of actions, in the discussion of these actions, and so on.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:36.000
If a dispute begins in the research team, then it becomes very problematic to talk about the reliability of the results.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Here, another aspect may arise.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.000
One of the participants of the team, not to confuse the terminology,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:55.000
one of the team of researchers can conduct the study in some of his or her own interests,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:10.000
or he or she can deliberately lead the group away from some aspects of the study.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:23.000
It is very important to think about the composition of the research team when it comes to group research.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000
And if we talk about yourself as a member of the team,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:38.000
you need to think very carefully before taking any action that may harm your colleagues in conducting the study,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
either directly or indirectly, or even lead the whole study.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
As for the relationship between the researcher and the participant of the study,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
it is described in your notebook in sufficient detail,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:04.000
what rights of the participant of the study can be violated, and what compensation measures should be followed.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:21.000
The participant of the study has the unconditional right to be heard, has the right to information, and a number of other things.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Here, another question arises.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:31.000
For example, the participant of the study has the right to information.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:42.000
In other words, you should warn him or her that you are conducting the study, that you are watching him or her.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:51.000
But we have already said that this can lead to the distortion of the collected data.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And there is no solution to this problem.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
You need to focus on the situation every time.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Maybe, at some points, the principle of utilitarianism can be used.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.000
The ethical problems are listed.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The permission to conduct the study and the agreement of the level of access to information.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:37.000
At the very beginning, we talked a little bit about this, but I will allow myself to repeat it again.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:47.000
The permission to conduct the study, from the point of view of ethics, should be asked for.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:44:02.000
But on the other hand, having asked for permission to conduct the study, you can be limited in the level of access to information.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And this problem should be solved every time, in every specific case, with every specific leader and researcher.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.000
The issue of confidentiality is very difficult.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Because a number of studies require studying of financial documents,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:45.000
other documents that are not intended for the ears, eyes of a third-party observer,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:54.000
then the question is very often raised whether it is possible and necessary to use such data.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:04.000
The principle of solving this problem is as follows.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:15.000
If it is possible to avoid using confidential information in the study, it is better to avoid it.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:22.000
If this information is extremely necessary for conducting the study,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:31.000
then, most likely, the report on the study will have limited access.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000
The same applies to dissertations.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.000
If you use data in your dissertation that can be considered as confidential,

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
then it is better to make this dissertation closed.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Another way to bypass this sharp corner is not to use absolute numbers,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
but to use relative numbers, percentage numbers.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:07.000
We have discussed the information of participants about their goals and tasks.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
We decide whether it is necessary or not.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:20.000
The feeling of the participants' own dignity should never be underestimated.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:30.000
We have no right to undermine the dignity of the participants of the study.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
And the last one.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
The publication of the data obtained during the study.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Only reliable data should be published.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:49.000
This data should not distort the truth and should not be presented in such a way

01:46:49.000 --> 01:47:03.000
as to present the researcher in the best light or to undermine the dignity of the competitor.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:21.000
After discussing the questions of ethics, we have come to the conclusion of today's video course.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:27.000
We have discussed the main principles of conducting a managerial study.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.000
We have discussed or I have tried to tell you about the main methods,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000
scientific approaches to conducting a study,

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:47.000
paying special attention to the purpose, role and essence of qualitative studies in business

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
and what we have just discussed about the questions of ethics.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Of course, this course is very short,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
like any other course of study,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000
which cannot contain all the variety of information,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
cannot describe all the situations,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:19.000
cannot give all the examples and give an instruction on all the cases of your difficult life in business.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Therefore, I can make a recommendation.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Pay attention to the list of literature given at the end of the workbook.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
And special attention.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.000
If you need to conduct a business or a managerial study,

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:50.000
refer to the fundamental work of Mark Saunders and the authors of the method of economic study.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:58.000
This is practically the only source in Russian today,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:06.000
which has absorbed information on the issues discussed today.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I will only make a remark.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Pay attention, sometimes there are inaccuracies in the translation.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
The original book is called

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Research methods for the business students.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:32.000
That is, the methods of study for the students of the MBA program,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
for business students, if translated literally.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Let the word economic studies not confuse you.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000
In Russian, this is exactly what you need.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000
These are management studies, business studies.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:58.000
And a very large number of other information, which is not listed in this list.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:03.000
If you use the Internet as a source, be careful.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:13.000
A lot of incorrect, and sometimes confusing information is contained in the Internet.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Use the triangulation method to select high-quality and reliable secondary information for your own research.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
And the last one.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Only self-education, only a desire for new knowledge, only a desire to gain experience, to learn something, can help you, my dear listeners and viewers, to achieve success in business faster.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Thank you for your attention and good luck.
