00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The second part of the question is about the price of financial resources.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
The top manager should know the price of financial resources for his company for the following reasons.

00:13.000 --> 00:23.000
The first is that the price of the capital is the return on investment by investors in the company's activities.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
The manager should anticipate possible changes in the price of shares depending on the expected return on investment and dividends.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
In the first part of the question we discussed the situation of the price of the company's own capital.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
The company can use both its own and borrowed capital as speculative capital.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
It can buy shares at a low price and sell them at a high price after receiving positive dividends.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
The second reason is the price of borrowed capital.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
The price of borrowed capital is associated with the interest paid.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
Therefore, it is necessary to choose the best option out of several options to attract investors.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
If we look at the current situation of the financial market in Russia,

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
we can see that the interest rate in the currency is 5-6%.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
However, banks say that you should borrow money from the bank.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
Banks say that you should borrow in CHF, AUD or JPY from the bank.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
This is due to the fact that these currencies are very conservative and do not change the rate in the least.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
The interest rate in the currency is 5-6%.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
Therefore, the top manager should assume that the price of the borrowed resources is associated with the interest paid.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
The manager responsible for the loan policy of the company should propose solutions related to the best possible outcome.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
The manager responsible for the loan policy of the company should propose solutions related to the best possible outcome.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
The price of financial resources is one of the key factors in the analysis of investment projects and planning of the company's financial budget.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:22.000 --> 03:32.000
The price of the million dollars that we had in 2005-2006, when the average price was about 28.7 rubles per dollar,

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
is not comparable to the million dollars that we have now.

03:40.000 --> 03:48.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
This is due to the fact that the interest rate in one currency is not associated with the interest paid.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
This is due to the fact that the interest rate in one currency is not associated with the interest paid.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.000
The interest rate in one currency is not associated with the interest paid.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
The interest rate in one currency is not associated with the interest paid.

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
Investment projects related to the acquisition of new equipment and the launch of new production,

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
should take into account these factors.

04:44.000 --> 04:52.000
If we consider the company's financial budget,

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
we should take into account the interest rate and the sources of loans.

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
This is the information on how the interest rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation changed from 2002 to 2007.

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
This is the information on how the interest rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation changed from 2002 to 2007.

05:16.000 --> 05:24.000
The interest rate fell from 25% per year to 10% per year on June 19, 2007.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
The interest rate depends on the level of inflation in the country.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
This is an achievement of the authorities and the regulatory body of money circulation in Russia,

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.

05:48.500 --> 05:56.500
The Central Bank of the Russian Federation is a commercial lending resource provided by a non-financial organization in the Russian market.

05:56.500 --> 06:04.500
To date, on average, the loan rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation

06:04.500 --> 06:12.500
is somewhere around 2% of the base rate of the Central Bank.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
In the case of a loan, we are looking at the base rate of the Central Bank,

06:21.000 --> 06:29.000
which signals us what will happen to the price of these resources in the next period of time.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
When interacting with banks, we should take into account this dynamic.

06:37.500 --> 06:45.500
In the case of a change in the rate of refinancing of the Central Bank,

06:45.500 --> 06:53.500
the borrower has the right to claim a reduction in the interest rate,

06:53.500 --> 07:01.500
and the bank has the right to increase the rate of the loan provided by the client.

07:07.500 --> 07:15.500
The next slide shows the actual information provided by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation

07:15.500 --> 07:23.500
on the interest rates of non-financial organizations, i.e. Russian enterprises, in 2007.

07:23.500 --> 07:31.500
We see that the base rate of the Central Bank remains at the level of 9.5%, 10.1%, 10.2%, and 10.3%.

07:37.500 --> 07:43.500
This is approximately the level of the Central Bank of Russia.

07:43.500 --> 07:51.500
Commercial banks resell the resources they attract from the open financial markets,

07:51.500 --> 07:59.500
primarily private deposits, at a 4-5% rate to non-financial organizations.

08:00.000 --> 08:08.000
The dynamics are such that the money we deposit in banks can only be saved

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
based on the influence of inflation, but in no case can it be multiplied.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
The interest rate on deposits today does not even reach the level of inflation that exists in the country today.

08:24.500 --> 08:30.500
But at least it minimizes the losses of money that can be made

08:30.500 --> 08:36.500
if the money is not deposited in a risky instrument.

08:36.500 --> 08:42.500
Of course, for the current activities of enterprises, the acceptable rates,

08:42.500 --> 08:48.500
and these interest rates can already be considered acceptable,

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
but in the year 2005, when the Central Bank rate was 210%,

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
all credit resources were usually equated to the dollar equivalent or allocated in currency.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
The rates that we see today in the financial market allow companies

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
to plan their activities more effectively,

09:13.500 --> 09:19.500
to direct the resources they attract with less risk,

09:19.500 --> 09:25.500
both in increasing non-returnable assets and in increasing returnable funds,

09:25.500 --> 09:31.500
and, of course, to provide effective support for the development of the company's business.

09:31.500 --> 09:37.500
The next slide shows the average interest rates of commercial banks

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
and non-financial organizations and the population in the US dollar.

09:44.000 --> 09:52.000
We see that the ruble rate for non-financial organizations is slightly lower,

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
on average, by about 1%, than the ruble equivalent.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
But again, if we compare the situation with the past periods of time,

10:04.500 --> 10:12.500
when the ruble rate was 210% and the currency rate was about 15-18%,

10:12.500 --> 10:20.500
at that time, our enterprises were credited to the dollar equivalent of the commercial banks,

10:20.500 --> 10:24.500
we see, of course, a positive dynamic.

10:24.500 --> 10:30.500
The ruble strengthens its position, becomes a stable national currency,

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
and today, according to experts, the dollar component of the population accumulation

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
is less than 90 billion dollars.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
These are rather modest figures compared to what the population of our country had before.

10:51.500 --> 10:57.500
It turns out that the dollar is gradually being washed out and used only as a means of calculation,

11:03.500 --> 11:09.500
or used as a calculation for everyday needs of the wealthy category of citizens.

11:12.500 --> 11:18.500
In 2007, the population was credited to the currency by commercial banks

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
at a rate of 12.5-13.3%.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
This is the most common price of credit resources

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
that can be used to attract companies to the economy

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
or to meet the needs of the private sector in Russia.

11:41.500 --> 11:47.500
The Central Bank rate determines the commercial rates of loans in rubles and US dollars for the national economy.

11:55.500 --> 12:01.500
Another promising way to attract additional financial resources

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
to the company's total capital,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
as well as to the company's debt,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
is to place corporate debt.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
How effective is this option?

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
First of all, the company is focused on diversification of options for attracting financial resources.

12:24.500 --> 12:30.500
On the other hand, it is potentially ready to give a certain amount of transparency to the company's economic operations,

12:36.500 --> 12:42.500
so that the debtors are sure that the debtor's risk is acceptable and the debtor can pay off his or her debt.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
The slide shows the characteristics of how to start placing corporate debt.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
In particular, it is assumed that it is advisable to attract consultants

13:08.500 --> 13:12.500
who can provide support in two main areas.

13:12.500 --> 13:18.500
First of all, lawyers who register the issuance of documents to the Federal Financial Market Service.

13:21.500 --> 13:27.500
The second part of the consultants are specialists of investment and banking units of large banks,

13:28.500 --> 13:34.500
who are familiar with the standards of requirements of investors in the stock market for issued bonds,

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
and who can not only help the company prepare for the issuance of corporate bonds,

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
but also determine the most profitable and acceptable time period

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
when it is necessary to go to the stock market with the proposal of one's own debt obligations to the sale.

13:57.500 --> 14:03.500
The next part of the consultants is the underwriter,

14:03.500 --> 14:09.500
who is involved in the preparation of the so-called IPO.

14:09.500 --> 14:15.500
The underwriter is a fund intermediary,

14:15.500 --> 14:21.500
which is a co-financial partner of the company that issues corporate bonds.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
The underwriter is a participant of the stock market.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
According to the contract with the issuer,

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
he issues securities on behalf of the issuer.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
The underwriter offers documents to the RAU-EES or RAU-Gazprom

14:48.500 --> 14:54.500
on the RTS or MMVB platform and sells them on behalf of the RAU-EES.

14:59.500 --> 15:05.500
In Russian practice, there are not rare cases when a pool or a group of underwriters is created,

15:05.500 --> 15:09.500
consisting of three or four investment banks,

15:09.500 --> 15:13.500
which organize the placement jointly.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
This increases the size of the commission.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
On the other hand, a pool of underwriters is a certain guarantee or a positive recommendation for the stock market,

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
when a serious company with a good business reputation offers debt obligations to a particular issuer.

15:30.500 --> 15:36.500
The choice of an underwriter is one of the most important stages of the preparation of the corporate bonds issue,

15:44.500 --> 15:50.500
because it is necessary not to make a mistake and take into account the experience of the current players of the underwriting market.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
If we consider the results of the 2006 work in Russia,

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
11 billion dollars of corporate bonds were issued at the same time as corporate shares were placed on the Russian stock markets.

16:11.500 --> 16:17.500
The company Troika Dialog is the leader in this regard.

16:25.500 --> 16:31.500
The underwriting characteristics are described in the slide.

16:31.500 --> 16:37.500
You can find a link to the underwriter rating on the website of the company and find out

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
what conditions and time it takes to prepare the bonds and what the cost of providing services can be.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
The fund platform or the stock exchange is also involved in the preparation of the corporate bonds issue.

16:58.500 --> 17:04.500
The stock exchange is the place of the trading organization when the securities are placed.

17:09.500 --> 17:15.500
The stock exchange provides assistance to the players in the market,

17:15.500 --> 17:21.500
provides information about the conditions and time it takes to prepare the bonds,

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
informs the players about the marketing of the bonds and the amount of the bond issued at the stock exchange.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
There is an auction order to determine the price of the bond,

17:47.500 --> 17:53.500
which allows the companies that imitate the corporate bonds to attract resources at a more optimal market price.

17:56.500 --> 18:02.500
The slide shows a link to the Russian stock exchange,

18:04.500 --> 18:10.500
where you can read the list of the participants of the auctions and conduct a selection analysis,

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
for example, on the industry aspect or the size of the business of the companies that imitated the corporate bonds.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
You can also read the percentage of the shares that were placed by the companies that imitated the bonds.

18:29.500 --> 18:35.500
The slide shows the number of shares that were placed by the companies that imitated the bonds.

18:37.500 --> 18:43.500
If we consider the purpose of the placement of corporate bonds,

18:43.500 --> 18:49.500
in order to minimize the volume of costs associated with the awarding of the underwriter and the stock exchange commission,

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
the threshold level of profitability and net profit of the company should be at least $20 million.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
In this case, we say that the effect of the scale can be achieved,

19:15.500 --> 19:21.500
and the volume of the economy on interest rates from the placement of corporate bonds will allow the underwriter to cover various commissions,

19:26.500 --> 19:32.500
to pay the reward to the consultants,

19:32.500 --> 19:38.500
to close the stock exchange commission on which the trading of corporate bonds took place.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
In this case, if we have fewer business volumes,

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
it is more reasonable to use traditional methods of attracting additional financial resources as borrowed capital,

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
to work with commercial banks or to imitate the volume of VCSELs that can be made by each company

20:01.500 --> 20:07.500
and that does not require the state registration of the Federal Service for Financial Markets.

20:09.500 --> 20:15.500
In addition to the stock exchange and the underwriter, there are also the depositors, the registrar, the account depository and the account bank.

20:19.500 --> 20:25.500
The next slide shows the approximate price level that implies the issuance of corporate bonds.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
We can, accordingly, decide what costs should be incurred for registration of corporate bonds on the fund platform and for preparation of registration of the issuance of corporate bonds.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
To compare, when considering the options of borrowing on the financial market,

20:54.500 --> 21:00.500
the financial director must take into account that the bank transaction is closed

21:00.500 --> 21:06.500
and regulated only by the contractual relations between the borrower and the bank.

21:06.500 --> 21:12.500
At the same time, the company can get a lot of indirect benefits

21:12.500 --> 21:18.500
in the case of choosing the option of placing corporate bonds.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
The majority of investors who consider the feasibility of placing their free financial resources in corporate bonds

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
will get acquainted with the state of the company's business,

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
will recommend to their clients to buy these bonds or to buy these bonds on their behalf.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
This will indirectly affect the growth of the recognition and therefore the growth of the business value.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
The next slide shows the approximate price level that implies the issuance of corporate bonds on the fund platform.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
In the case of placing shares, the law requires the existing shareholder to have the right to buy shares of a new issue for 45 days.

22:03.500 --> 22:09.500
In the case of placing shares, the law requires the existing shareholder to have the right to buy shares of a new issue for 45 days.

22:13.500 --> 22:19.500
This is in the case when the issuer issues a share issue to the fund market

22:19.500 --> 22:25.500
and within 45 days the current shareholder can buy this issue.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
Another point is that the Russian legislation imposes restrictions on advertising of new issues until the date of their state registration.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
However, the company can attract attention to its main activities

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
through various advertising methods, articles in the media,

22:50.500 --> 22:56.500
and other media without mentioning the fact that the bonds are to be issued on the fund market.

23:04.500 --> 23:10.500
For example, the central TV advertisement of the Kavdorsky GOKO

23:10.500 --> 23:16.500
was published by the MDM group.

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
This ad might seem strange to the average person,

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
but it is a great source of information for the fund market participants.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
The Federal Financial Markets Service is the successor of the Federal Commission on the Market of Corporate Bonds.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
If we are talking about a list of documents that the Federal Financial Markets Service should submit,

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
we can find this information on the Federal Financial Markets Service's official website

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
or contact a consultant who provides the appropriate legal services for the preparation of corporate bonds.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
The chart of the stages of the primary placement organization is shown on the slide.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
The stages and the sequence of actions are shown.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
The eighth point regarding the PR of the event is that

24:39.000 --> 24:45.000
the support and information of the market,

24:45.500 --> 24:51.500
and the information of potential buyers, who are the final buyers of securities, is carried out constantly.

24:54.500 --> 25:00.500
This allows the market to prepare for the appropriate moment,

25:00.500 --> 25:06.500
when it will be necessary to buy a volume of imitated securities,

25:06.500 --> 25:12.500
or shares to increase its own capital, or bonds to increase its borrowed capital.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
If you pay attention,

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
the information about the so-called national IPOs

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
on the Reserve Bank of the Russian Federation,

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
the Rosneft oil company, and the Vneshtorkbank

25:37.500 --> 25:43.500
are measured from 12 months to 6 months,

25:43.500 --> 25:49.500
when the market was informed about the event.

25:49.500 --> 25:55.500
The IPO is scheduled for at least 125 days.

25:55.500 --> 26:01.500
This is the maximum time required for the full preparation,

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
so that there are no shortcomings or shortcomings in the procedure.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
As a rule, the preparation of this procedure takes at least one year,

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
when the first half is the pre-project or pre-processing procedure,

26:27.500 --> 26:33.500
where all relevant documents must be prepared,

26:33.500 --> 26:39.500
when the company must be set up to work in accordance with the requirements of the fund market for disclosure of information,

26:45.500 --> 26:51.500
and be ready to jointly participate in the event from 1 to 12,

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
and to conduct the issuance of corporate bonds or shares of the company in a productive manner.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
The choice of the scheme and the conditions for the placement of the funds.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
Here we consider the issue of the money that we will receive

27:18.500 --> 27:24.500
and the tactical or strategic tasks that the company will face.

27:24.500 --> 27:30.500
The slide shows an example of the Russian trading system.

27:30.500 --> 27:36.500
The conditions for the placement of the securities may vary depending on the primary placement choice,

27:36.500 --> 27:42.500
when it is possible to place corporate bonds with preliminary deposit of money and securities,

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
or without preliminary deposit of money and securities.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
The place of the accounting of securities may be in the accounting depository,

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
in the registrar's office or in another depository.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
The order of determining the price of the securities placed,

28:08.500 --> 28:14.500
the order of determining the price of securities placed at the auction.

28:14.500 --> 28:20.500
The next slide shows the scheme of placing securities under the condition of preliminary deposit.

28:20.500 --> 28:26.500
When investors transfer money to the accounting bank in advance,

28:26.500 --> 28:32.500
the accounting bank makes payments between the participants of the trading platform

28:33.000 --> 28:39.000
and the accountants of the trading platform.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
There is no situation when you can buy more than you have left in the accounting bank.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
This method is the most common and sometimes it is called the exchange method.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
When the collected money is received by the issuer from the underwriter

29:00.500 --> 29:06.500
and the accountant of the accounting bank makes a payment to the underwriter,

29:06.500 --> 29:12.500
the participant or the buyer of securities at the trading platform of the corresponding volume,

29:12.500 --> 29:16.500
either of corporate bonds or shares.

29:16.500 --> 29:22.500
The next slide shows the scheme of placing securities under the condition of preliminary deposit.

29:22.500 --> 29:28.500
In this case, we say that the seller must make a payment to the established date of payments.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
The seller must reserve securities.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
The buyer must reserve money from the accounting bank.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
On the day of payments, the clearing center of the exchange checks the availability of securities and money

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
on both sides and, if necessary, gives instructions for simultaneous transfer of assets.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
In this case, the situation is also excluded when either side does not fulfill its own obligations.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
If we recall the situation in the mid-1990s,

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
there were many cases in the press when either side did not fulfill its own obligations

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
either on the delivery of securities or on the volume of financial funds

30:17.000 --> 30:23.000
that the underwriter had to pay, and, accordingly, the issuer on the issued securities.

30:23.500 --> 30:29.500
Today, such situations are practically excluded.

30:29.500 --> 30:35.500
The scheme of placing securities under the condition of preliminary deposit can be implemented

30:35.500 --> 30:41.500
when the buyer transfers money to the seller,

30:41.500 --> 30:47.500
and then the seller gives the order to the investor to transfer securities.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
The buyer is not in a favorable position,

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
because he first separates from his money and only then receives the securities.

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
At the same time, if there are free deals,

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
there may be various preferences related to the auction price of the securities placed

31:12.500 --> 31:18.500
under conditions that the buyer can additionally negotiate with the issuer.

31:23.500 --> 31:29.500
The dilemma is whether to choose a financial price or an auction.

31:29.500 --> 31:35.500
What should the issuer choose for corporate bonds?

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
On the other hand, the issuer should choose a price that is guaranteed

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
that the volume of corporate bonds issued will be placed.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
There are two ways to determine the price of the bonds issued.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
On the one hand, there is a fixed price,

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
which is determined by the board of directors of the issuer company,

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
that is, the one that issues the debt.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.500
The price does not change until the beginning of the deposit.

32:06.500 --> 32:10.500
The second option is the auction price.

32:10.500 --> 32:14.500
The price is determined during the auction.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.500
At the moment, most deposits are made at certain prices in advance.

32:18.500 --> 32:22.500
Few imitators with a developed market of their own securities

32:22.500 --> 32:26.500
decide to hold auctions to determine the price of the bond.

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
The board of directors of the company may decide

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
whether to place a bet on the attracted financial resources.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
If the bet is not higher than the expected value,

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
it is beneficial for the company.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
If the bet is not higher than the expected value,

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
it is not profitable for the company.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
If the bet does not meet the expected value,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
it is possible to use alternative ways to attract resources.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Accordingly, many companies go on a conservative path

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
to determine the fixed price.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
At the same time, the auction is the prospect of the future.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
It often happens that the market reacts

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
to interesting opportunities.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
For example, investors compete

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
for the extensive growth of large companies

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
or for the growth of basic companies.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
They compete for the purchase of securities

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
and are ready to provide a large amount of financial resources

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
to the guaranteed bond holders.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
They are ready to buy these bonds

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
at extremely profitable prices

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
based on the minimum fee for the service

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
of the debt to the investors.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
The technology of the IPO with a fixed price.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
There are a large number of options

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
for determining the fixed price.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
The price can be tied to an economic indicator

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
such as the oil barrel or the Trojan horse gold or silver.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
A new price can be set every day

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
or this price can be determined

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
based on the preliminary claims of the buyer.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
In the event of a price determination during the auction,

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
the value is unknown until the end of the auction.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
Therefore, many Russian companies

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
choose the method of placing securities

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
based on a fixed price.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
In the event of an auction,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
when the company is focused on the possibility

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
or favorable conditions for placing its debt obligations

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
the following sequence of actions takes place.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
The slide shows three main stages.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
First of all, on the day of the initial placement,

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
potential buyers submit their own claims

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
to the trading system for the purchase of securities.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
The trading system summarizes the applications

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
for the purchase and issues an underwriter

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
with the information on the price.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
The underwriter with the imitator

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
on the basis of the summary register

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
determines the point of sale.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
This is when the price corresponds

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
to the maximum amount of the involved funds.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
At the same time, the underwriter

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
who has chosen the price

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
meets all the requirements of the application

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
at the same time.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
In the event of an auction,

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
the value is unknown until the end of the auction.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
The types of auctions are presented

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
on the slide.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
There are three possible options.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
The first option is based on the application

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
when the application can be limited

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
and the second option is market.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
The market application is when the buyer

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
indicates only the amount he would like to spend

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
and the price is determined

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
by the market price.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
The second option is when the application

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
is visible to all participants

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
or only to the underwriter with the imitator.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
The third option is based on the application

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
when the application is limited

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
and the third option is based on the price.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
In this case, we say that the price level

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
is determined and the applications are satisfied

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
based on the price of the application.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
When the imitator determines the price

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
after the collection of all applications

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
and determines the average price.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
To sum up, the debt capital has a value.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
It is expressed in the service of the debt.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
If we work with credit organizations,

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
it is connected with the payment of interest

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
to the banks that serve our debt.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
If it concerns the issuance of corporate securities,

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
it is connected with the payment of interest

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
and the payment of interest

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
to the investor.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
The second option is the level of profitability

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
which is either fixed by the imitator

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
combined with the underwriter

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
or is determined by the auction

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
for investors on the exchange platform.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Depending on the size of the borrower's business

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
you can choose a form of attracting borrowing resources.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
The threshold value is $20 million

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
as a result of working for a financial year of net profit.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
In the case that the company has not yet achieved such a figure

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
within the framework of its own strategy,

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
the recommendation to work with banks

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
is to diversify the credit portfolio

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
between several banks

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
and choose the most favorable conditions

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
for the banks that will give the most profitable rates,

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
terms of credit, and the amount of the renewed or non-renewed credit line.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
If we have the opportunity to declare

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
net profit of more than $20 million

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
we can already claim more effective attraction

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
of financial resources from the stock market

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
when investors buy our debt

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
at lower rates than commercial interest rates

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
in the credit organizations,

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
in the banks that lend us.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
From the point of view of placing debt on the stock market

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
we can already see that in addition to direct benefits

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
in relation to the possibility of cheaper attraction

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
we also get a lot of indirect or indirect benefits

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
due to the fact that the valuation of the business

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
can increase sharply.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
For one simple objective reason,

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
the company must be transparent,

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
and the company must be able to provide

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
the necessary services to the company.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
The third part of the questions

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
is about the money market.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
I would like to draw your attention

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
to the slide where it is stated

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
that money is a commodity.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
Depending on the macroeconomic conditions

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
the cost of money can be different.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
At the same time, as historical examples,

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
we can draw such conclusions

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
that in post-war Germany

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
the inflation rate was up to 20,000% per year

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
and money was issued in huge quantities,

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
that is, there were cases

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
when people left their money carts outside

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
to go to the store and look at the prices.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
When they left the store,

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
the money was on the roadside

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
and the cart was privatized or expropriated.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
This is a hyperinflationary economy.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
If the crisis is accompanied

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
by the need to issue additional

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
debts to the state,

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
which will lead to an increase

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
in inflation in two or three months,

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
the level of commercial loans will increase.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
If the base rate of the central bank

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
is higher than the base rate of commercial loans,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
the chain reaction to increase prices

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
for goods and services begins.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
At the same time, financial instruments

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
are looking for a more stable base.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
This is expressed in stable foreign currencies.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Therefore, the main factors

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
of the economic growth

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
of the Russian economy are the following.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
First of all, we highlight the growth

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
of international investment ratings in Russia,

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Russian issuers and their debt instruments.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
The stability of the economy

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
over the past six years allows Western large investors

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
to predict the future profit of the Russian budget.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
This means that the Russian economy

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
is becoming very attractive to investment.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
Today, the US dollar is the largest

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
in the world, and the US dollar is the largest

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
in the world.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
The US dollar is the largest

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
in the world.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Today, American investors invest dollars

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
in the Russian economy.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
The dollar is devalued, but is now converted

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
into rubles.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
In addition to the declared profitability

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
of the fund market,

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
the Russian fund market

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
is also developing.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
The euro is in a more conservative position

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
and the exchange rate is increasing.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
The average exchange rate is 34 rubles per euro.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
The Russian fund market is a very important

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
part of the Russian economy.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
The Russian economy is a very important part of the Russian economy.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
This is why the year 2006 was the year

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
when the Russian economy was the most invested in the world.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
The Russian economy was the most invested in the world.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
According to the estimates,

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
the Russian economy is worth $40-50 billion per year.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
At this rate, no economy in the world

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
will be able to compete with the Russian economy.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
If this trend persists for the next two or three years,

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
the Russian economy will be the most

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
invested in the world.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
This will automatically reduce the cost of financial resources

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
for the borrowers in Russia.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
The second objective factor is the reduction of risks

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
and the trust of Russian and international investors

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
in the debt.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
Today, there are practically no corporate defaults

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
in the debt.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
The market reacts very clearly to the reduction of prices

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
on financial resources due to the market's quality.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
When the debt is imitated by conscientious borrowers,

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
there is an opportunity to work at an acceptable level of profitability

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
at the required quality level of the borrowers.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
The year 2005 is considered the year

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
when the Russian debt market

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
entered a new level of quality.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
This is due to the fact that foreign potential

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
has entered the Russian trading platforms.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
This is why Russian companies have gained access

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
to foreign financial resources.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
The next slide shows the main trends of the securities market.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
We can predict that this trend will persist for the next three years.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
First, it is a rapid increase in the number of issuances.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
We are currently observing a very rapid and systematic

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
centralization of various groups of companies.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
We can see the increase in shareholder capital

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
not only due to the current activities of individual companies,

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
but also due to the voluntary purchase of individual companies.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
In addition, we can clearly see an increase

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
in the average volume of one issuance.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
Today, the average volume of an issuance

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
is about $1.5 billion.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
This means that companies place

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
bonds or issue additional shares

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
in this particular volume.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
This means that the quality and volume

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
of the resources attracted to one conditional issuer increases.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
In addition, we can see a decrease in the cost

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
of investing in the long-term market

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
due to the fact that the largest underwriters

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
are playing a role in the game.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
Underwriters are participating in the institutional capital

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
through their subsidiary companies or directly.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
This leads to a certain damping policy

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
in the area of pricing for obtaining a certain client field.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
In the future, the cost of investing in the long-term market

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
will increase.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
The most popular traditional banking

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
lending scheme is the second one,

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
the third one is the bond loan scheme,

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
and the fourth one is the IPO procedure.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
Ideally, a Russian company

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
that is focused on diversification of loans

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
and corporate bonds should implement

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
all four methods of attracting financing.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
Let's take a closer look at each of them.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
The first condition is that we need to set

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
certain criteria or signs of choosing a credit source.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
We can set four basic criteria.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
The first one is the level of the loan.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
The second one is the cost of financing.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
This is the percentage of the loan.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
The third one is the cost of the zero cycle

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
when we need to pay or bear the costs

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
related to the preparation of the deal.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
The fourth one is the term of financing.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
We see that the loan is not paid

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
and the financing period is increasing

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
over the last five years.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
The Russian investors are increasing

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
the financing conditions

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
and the conditions are becoming

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
more and more similar to the Western standards.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
The third criterion is the necessary

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
collateral.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
This is the most acceptable way

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
to secure the loan.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
The insurance companies are working

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
to ensure the risk of not paying the money.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
In addition, various requirements

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
by informal but organized companies

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
are being met.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
The financial group is based

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
on regional associations

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
and associations of entrepreneurs

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
with funds to provide

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
and develop their own members

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
through the provision of collective guarantees

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
and the organization of the financing

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
as the fourth criterion.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
On the one hand,

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
depending on the type of financing,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
the terms begin to acquire

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
the characteristics of the loan.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
In the previous question,

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
I mentioned the financial group.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
If we consider the relationship

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
with commercial banks,

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
many companies build measurable

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
processes of interaction with banks

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
to receive loans.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
Therefore, the terms become clear

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
when and how to start negotiations

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
to get a possibility of either

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
re-lending or not allowing the cash flow.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
The characteristics of a commercial bank

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
as one of the most common financing options

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
can be distinguished by the following advantages.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
First, it is, of course,

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
a well-balanced interaction

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
with the service bank.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
The bank usually knows the financial state of the borrower,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
sees the cash flows that the borrower has,

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
the intensity of income and spending of funds,

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
the seasonality and characteristics

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
of the borrower's payment ability.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
There is no requirement for the state registration

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
of such transactions,

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
i.e. non-public transactions between the loan organization

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
and the borrower.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
What are the disadvantages?

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
First, small loans.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
This is due to the fact that the bank

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
is not a public bank,

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
and the amount of net profit

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
that the borrower receives

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
is not known to the bank.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
The bank declares the amount of net profit

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
to the credit committee,

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
and then to the monetary circulation department.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
In comparison with other financial resource attraction options,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
the bank loan has the biggest disadvantage,

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
namely, small loans.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
First of all, these restrictions are introduced

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation,

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
which regulates and strictly regulates

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
the methods of assessing the loan ability

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
of the borrower,

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
as well as the allocation of the reserve

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
to the various categories.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
The average loan term is one year,

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
but today banks issue longer loans.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
In addition, the need to pay

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
monthly interest payments

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
is also a problem.

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
In other cases, payments can be made

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
at the end of the term,

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
or in a quarterly manner.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
High interest rates,

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
compared to what exists on the market

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
today, are an alternative way

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
to pay the loan.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
However, today the bank loan

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
is the most common and safe

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
scheme of interaction

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
between banks and borrowers.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
The characteristics of the exchange programs.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
The first advantage is the possibility

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
of obtaining loans

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
through the issuance of VXLs.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
At the same time,

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
there is no registration of VXL issuance.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
This is a company's business

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
to issue VXLs at what time and on what conditions.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
The third advantage is the absence

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
of a VXL issuance.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
No one can regulate the amount

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
of VXLs issued in the company

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
except for shareholders.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
The VXL program is often the preliminary stage

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
for preparing bonds.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
When the VXL program is transferred

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
to the VXL-exchange,

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
the VXL-exchange provides

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
financial advice and intermediary services,

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
conducts a register of VXL issuance

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
and cancellation, controls the transfer

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
and can specify the organization

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
and time of transfer of VXLs,

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
and the number of transactions

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
that are made.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
The VXL is a more liquid instrument

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
than a loan,

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
because the interaction between the VXL-giver

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
and the market

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
is much larger than a bank loan.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
What are the disadvantages?

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
First of all,

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
it is necessary to conduct an expertise

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
on the authenticity and reliability

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
of the transfer chain in the VXL.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
It is an extremely expensive,

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
complicated and difficult procedure.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
The financial intermediary

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
is our future potential underwriter.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
He looks at the undeclared and unregistered

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
volume of the issuance of these

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
debt obligations in a particular company

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
and can predict what will happen

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
to corporate bonds.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
The second disadvantage is that

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
the VXL is the least secure instrument.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
Since the VXL is issued in a documented form,

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
the documentation of the VXL

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
is often accompanied by a fake VXL.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
When the VXL,

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
by all external signs,

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
is issued by a reliable company,

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
it can be a beautiful fake.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
When the term of VXL cancellation

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
is not coincided with the date

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
in the VXL,

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
when one of the obligatory conditions

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
is not met,

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
when the signatures of the first parties

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
do not coincide with the date,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
such VXLs are called bronze VXLs.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
If we are going to issue VXLs

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
for the external environment,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
we need consultations and support

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
from external experts and consultants.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
The main advantage of the VXL

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
is the absence of the need

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
to pay interest.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
By issuing the VXL,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
we are voluntarily including

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
the VXL in the VXL.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
The VXL is a good example

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
of how to make a decision

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
on the basis of the VXL.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
The VXL is a good example

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
of how to make a decision

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
on the basis of the VXL.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
The VXL is a good example

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
of how to make a decision

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
on the basis of the VXL.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
The VXL is a good example

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
of how to make a decision

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
on the basis of the VXL.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
The VXL is a good example

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
of how to make a decision

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
on the basis of the VXL.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
The VXL is a good example

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
of how to make a decision

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
on the basis of the VXL.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The main disadvantage is

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
the openness of the company.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
The company must make a lot of changes

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
related to capital investments.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The company must make a lot of changes

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
related to capital investments.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
The second disadvantage

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
is the capital waste.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
We get a certain uncontrollability

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
when holding a shareholders' meeting.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
We get a certain uncontrollability

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
when holding a shareholders' meeting.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
We must consider the interests

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
of the minority.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Otherwise, they can paralyze

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
the company's work.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
We must consider the interests

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
of the minority.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
We must consider the interests

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
of the minority.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Let's see the main characteristics

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
of the VXL.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
The VXL is not bound

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
to the stock market.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It is not bound to the ability

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
of the company to determine

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
the maximum amount of loans.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
If the company declares

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
its own responsibility for loans

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
plus the affiliated responsibility

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
of the shareholders and other businesses,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
the VXL will not be able

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
to issue large amounts of foreign financing

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
that will be the basis for increasing

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
the loan capital.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
The VXL is able to issue

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
corporate bonds for a long period of time.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
The VXL has a history of several decades.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
If the VXL had a long history,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
it would have been able

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
to borrow money for a long time.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
The VXL must meet the requirements

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
for repaying coupons

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
or pre-payments for bonds.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
At the same time,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
the VXL must meet the requirements

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
for repaying loans.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
The VXL must not have any real insurance.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
The bonds are issued without any debt.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
We do not transfer the bonds

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
to real estate.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
They can be used as collateral

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
for the VXL.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Another advantage is the ability

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
to manage the size of the debt.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
When the company can buy out

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
its own bonds on the market

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
on its own or through financial intermediaries,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
it can minimize the amount

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
of debt that the company has.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
The VXL must be transparent

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and ready for capital spending

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and for the state registration

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
of the VXL issuance.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
The VXL must be ready for documents

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and quarterly reports.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The VXL must be ready for documents

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
and quarterly reports.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
When we say that the company

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
receives long-term capital,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
the money is always cheaper

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
if it is for a long time.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
The company becomes disciplined

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and takes responsibility

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
for the extended circle

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
of shareholders.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
The company has the opportunity

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
to improve its image,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
trust and investors' trust

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
will allow to increase

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
the amount of capital

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
needed for financing

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
the company's strategy.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The company has the opportunity

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
to enter the capital market.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
This allows the company

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
to capitalize its value

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
on the capital market.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
This is the case

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
for the London Fund,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and for the New York Fund.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
The company's requirements.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
The main requirements

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
for the company's performance

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
are the following.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
The company must have

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
a highly qualified team

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and a business model.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
All the procedures

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
related to the organization

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
and the business processes

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
must be carried out

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
in accordance with the plan,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
the budget,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
the analysis of the results,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
the decision-making on the deviation,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
the adjustment of the company's development

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
course, and the change of the normative indicators

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
of the company's performance.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The company must be profitable.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
This means that all the procedures

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
related to the increase of the cost

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
for the minimization of the tax on the profit

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
or the reduction of the part of the revenue

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
from the implementation

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
of the tax on the profit

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
must be carried out in accordance

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
with the plan.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
The company must have

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
a strong financial control system.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
This is due to the company's

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
qualification and performance

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
that will allow the company

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
The company must have

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
the standards of management accounting

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
and public accounting.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The company must have

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
a strong financial control system

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
that will allow the company

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
The company must have

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
a strong financial control system

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
that will allow the company

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
The company must have

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
a strong financial control system

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
that will allow the company

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The company must have

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
a strong financial control system

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
that will allow the company

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
The company must have

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
a strong financial control system

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
that will allow the company

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
The company must have

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
a strong financial control system

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
that will allow the company

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
The company must have

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
a strong financial control system

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
and the use of the management accounting

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
and financial controlling methodology

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
that will allow the company

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
to control the existing cash flow.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
This will lead to the increase

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
of our own capital.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
We do not reflect the obligations

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
that we have,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
because we did not receive the documents

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
or to meet the standards set by the shareholders

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
in relation to our own capital.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
The obligations may be wrongly classified

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
according to the term of the payment.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
On the one hand,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
we assume that we have an extension

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
according to the documents,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
but on the other hand,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
the requirements of the creditors

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
in accordance with the violations

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
of certain agreements

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
require us to pay more early.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
At the same time,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
we reflect our obligations

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
based on the documents.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
The company has a potential

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and we believe that it has a positive

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
financial potential.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
We have an increasing investment

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
attractiveness compared to large companies.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
They are old players in the market

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
with a conservative policy of attraction.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
New players always use high level of attention

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
to the fact that we have a negative information

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
when we enter the open financial market.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Even if we had some contradictions

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
with the service banks,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
this information was not included

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
in the specialized database.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
The sources of information

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
are not reliable.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
We are only a subject of positive information.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
We may have a high potential growth.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
This is also interesting for our investors.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
We have a high level of profitability,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
proven efficiency of the existing management system,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
low systemic level of activity,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
and visibility of our business.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
We can clearly see where our place is in the market

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and what is the share of our market.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
We can consider the procedures

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
of working on new markets.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
This means an additional increase

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
of business activity

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and a growth of revenue from the implementation.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
We have a potential of not using segments

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
of attracting financing,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
primarily to reduce the cost of attracting resources.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
At the same time, we have negative factors

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that can negatively affect the potential of financing.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
First, there is a lack of large-scale financing sources.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
We are not sure how long it will take

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
to improve our financial situation.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
We have to abandon hidden and opaque forms of financing.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
If we have such a situation

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
and this information is released to the market,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
we will immediately be in a position

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
to make a decision.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
If this information is released to the market,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
we will be on the list of potential unfavorable clients.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
The market can react negatively.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
The lack of disclosure of our credit history,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
how we worked with the bank,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
is not only negative but also positive.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
The undervalued assets and business.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
The market is not able to react to the limited time.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
The low cost of clean assets

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
due to the undervalued assets in the company.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
The lack of timely management systems

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
and accounting.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
We did not have time and investment opportunities

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
to automate business activities.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
The lack of transparency.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
The lack of transparency.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
The lack of transparency.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
These are negative factors

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
that can negatively affect our financing.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
The next slide shows the financing scheme

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
within the framework of the current plan.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
The algorithm is that if there is an investment scheme,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
we need a financing parameter.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Three main parameters are the time, amount and cost.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
If we do not have an investment scheme,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
the lack of an investment scheme

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
means the lack of a formalized strategy.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
The financing goals of the company

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
can have either a design feature

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
or must be qualified

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
through the financing parameters,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
the time, amount and cost of the loan.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
In any case, we get a demand for the amount of funds

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
from the financing parameters.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
We can have a positive cash flow

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
or a negative cash flow.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
A positive cash flow is a situation

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
when the amount of money received

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
from the current activity can cover all current expenses.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
A negative cash flow is a situation

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
when the flow of money from the current activity

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
is compensated by a loan or by receiving funds

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
from the sale of some assets.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
A negative cash flow

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
is compensated by a loan.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
At the same time, the financing parameters

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
suggest that we are focusing on a long-term repayment.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
At the same time, the financing parameters

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
suggest that we are focusing on a long-term repayment.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
To achieve this,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
we need to form a market

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
with information from the underwriter

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
or the bondsman that the emitter or the company

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
that issued the loan agreement

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
agrees to repay its debts in advance

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
without the underwriter's participation.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
We use an auction scheme

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
to determine the cost of the loan

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
and the bond value.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
We use an auction scheme

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
to determine the cost of the loan

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
and the bond value.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
The next slide shows the main stages

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
of the bond issuance for corporate borrowers.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
The first stage is the decision-making stage.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
The first stage is the decision-making stage.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
To do this, we need to determine the parameters of the bond.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
To do this, we need to determine the parameters of the bond.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
In this case, we need to understand

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
whether we want to use the attractive financial resources

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
or whether we want to implement the investment part

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
within the framework of the company's strategy.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
In this case, we need to clearly predict the volumes,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
the deadlines and the technology of the work

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
related to the acquisition of new equipment

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
or the purchase of the necessary new land plots

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
or the construction of new production facilities

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
or the placement of new trading areas.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
The parameters of the bond are the consequence

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
of the strategy of using the borrowed capital

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
within the framework of the company's activities.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
The approval of the prospectus and the issuance of securities

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
should be detailed here.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:37.000
The period of key debt омissiоns

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.400
and permanent liabilities

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:45.400
is the period of key debt оmissions.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.400
The period of key debt оmissions

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:55.400
is the period of key debt оmissions.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.400
The second stage of state registration of the debt оmissions

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.400
is the period of key debt оmissions.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:10.200
The third stage of state registration of the debt оmissions

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:16.400
is the period of key debt оmissions.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.400
The third stage of state registration of the debt оmissions

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:29.400
is the period of key debt оmissions.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.400
The third stage of state registration of the debt оmissions

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.400
is the period of key debt оmissions.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.400
The third stage of state registration of the debt оmissions

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:47.400
is the period of key debt оmissions.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:55.400
The fourth stage of software registration

01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:02.200
includes registration of bonds

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.200
at individual banks in common use.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.200
This is a procedure for placing bonds in the trading system.

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:19.200
The fifth stage is to form a report on the results of the issuance of a bond.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:28.200
This report must be approved and registered by the Federal Financial Markets Service.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:38.200
In addition, the information about the state registration of the report on the results of the issuance of a bond in the media must be disclosed.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.200
The sixth stage of disclosure of information

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:48.200
involves quarterly reports of the issuer on the results of economic activity.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.200
The seventh stage is to cancel the bond.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:26:05.200
To summarize, the procedure for entering the debt market involves a serious organizational transformation within the company.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:12.200
The company is forced to abandon some attractive, but not promising,

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:18.200
from the point of view of a public, open company, methods of financial activity.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:26.200
At the same time, this is associated with the loss of conceivable or hidden profitability.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:32.200
It is associated with the need to disclose economic activity,

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:40.200
to ensure transparency in the results of quarterly reports for third-party investors.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:45.200
But as a result of these procedures, the most important thing is achieved.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.200
The company starts to work on the value of its business.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:27:00.200
The company is able to attract the maximum amount of funding to implement ambitious ideas and strategies.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:08.200
Interestingly, if we consider closed or so-called non-public companies,

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:30.200
the large amount of managers' attention is often focused on regulating the management of so-called gray or legal operations.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.200
If we consider the activities of public companies,

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:40.200
the requirements of the law in the area of tax evasion and disclosure of information are taken as a given.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:48.200
The company understands that the main center of the manager's attention is the growth of business activity.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:56.200
These are events aimed at increasing the revenue from the implementation as a financial result of business activity.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:04.200
Managers focus their skills on the creative function of the company,

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:09.200
which in the end has a positive impact on the net profit,

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:14.200
which in the end has a positive impact on the growth of the company's value.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:28.200
Therefore, if we are at the stage of the transition to the $20 million limit on net profit in the current financial year,

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:32.200
we can think about the effectiveness of further development.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:44.200
We can continue to engage in the so-called non-public way of attracting funding and securing our own market positions.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:47.200
In this case, we lose the most important thing.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.200
We lose the sense of the expensive nature of our own business.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:29:02.200
We lose the sense of self-sufficiency and the occupation of a certain place in the competitive environment of the open, civilized market.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:18.200
Dear colleagues, today we have discussed the topic of the company's capital and its ways of formation.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.200
Let me remind you that we have considered three areas of discussion.

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:31.200
The first area was about the source of finance, the second was about the price of financial resources,

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.200
and the third area was about the money market.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.200
Let us try to summarize what we have discussed today.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:51.200
First, the source of finance is the main way and main requirement for the development and support of any business of any business organization.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:30:05.200
At the same time, it is considered a loss of business benefit when a company has the potential to promote its own products or services to the market,

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:08.200
but has a limitation on financing.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:27.200
At the same time, we have discussed that the key factor that affects the efficiency of the company's operation and use of capital is the qualified staff, professionalism and experience of the company's leading employees.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:37.200
We have also determined that there are two major groups of capital that any business organization uses in its activities.

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.200
These are its own capital and borrowed capital.

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:47.200
At the same time, we have discussed that in the case of the growth and development of the market,

01:30:47.200 --> 01:31:00.200
when the demand for our products and services is increasing, when the volume of products and services produced by our company is increasing,

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:07.200
both in terms of the number of units, units of tons, units of units, in one order,

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:15.200
and prices are increasing at which we can sell our products in a favorable way,

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:25.200
companies are obliged and must use borrowed financial resources for extensive growth.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:44.200
Borrowed capital gives the effect of a financial lever when the fee for its use and operation is small and immeasurably less than the net profit in absolute terms,

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.200
either in rubles or in dollars.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:56.200
We have also discussed that if a company can and is able to use favorable market opportunities,

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:06.200
then the company's property complex increases in the conditions of the market growth due to the increase in its own capital,

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:12.200
and the increase in its own capital is achieved by the company's net profit,

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.200
by the company's increasing shareholding capital,

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:28.200
when the owners can make decisions about the additional volume of shares issued or the increase in the shares of the participants in the established capital,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:35.200
when the capital can grow due to the increase in the share of borrowed capital.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:45.200
We use short-term and long-term loans and loans of banks, financial organizations, investment companies

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:50.200
that are ready to buy our corporate bonds,

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:56.200
that are ready to use the capital of our company in their economic turnover,

01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:02.200
that are ready to be the first-class borrowers, and many banks are willing to work with us.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:11.200
It should also be noted that in addition to net profit as a result of the company's activities,

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:19.200
it is also necessary to work and provide maximum management control to the growth of the company's value.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:29.200
The company's value will increase in the future due to the company's public support, openness and transparency.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:39.200
On the one hand, this is a mandatory requirement of the market fund when placing bonds or when additional shares of our company are issued.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:49.200
But the preparation for the opportunity to work in such conditions requires a certain amount of time and, most importantly, finance.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:59.200
When a company has to structure its activities, when it is forced to avoid dubious financing options for its own activities,

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:04.200
when the company is guided by a long-term strategy of presence in the market.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:12.200
In this case, investors react positively to the facts and results of the company's economic activities

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:21.200
and with great confidence and great pleasure acquire the company's debt obligations.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:32.200
Regarding the money market, we said that it is always necessary to compare the possible ways of financing that the company has at its disposal.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:44.200
We noted that companies can use traditional banking lending, release or issuance of their own bonds,

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:51.200
companies can use the release and issuance of their own shares as an alternative,

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:56.200
and the fourth option is the release and issuance of their own bonds.

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:06.200
When making a decision on the means or sources of financing that we will use to implement our own strategy,

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:12.200
the company must take into account all the pros and cons, all the characteristics,

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:19.200
the data on the four ways to attract capital for the implementation of the company's strategy of development.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:38.200
Depending on the working conditions, the size of the business, the direction of the financing resources used,

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:44.200
we must build an element of the financial strategy as a management of capital.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:51.200
The company's financial director and his financial and economic services, unfortunately,

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:58.200
cannot regulate or influence the performance of the business activity as a way to benefit from the implementation.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:08.200
At the same time, the management of the company's expenses is a function of the financial and economic services.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:19.200
If the company adopts optimization schemes for minimizing costs associated with increasing labor productivity,

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:28.200
diversification of types of loans and reducing the cost of maintenance of third-party loans,

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:42.200
and reducing the cost of maintenance to one unit of the company's production or service,

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:46.200
the company will achieve a net profit.

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:54.200
At the same time, the financial director will be powerless if the rate of the company's revenue drop

01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:02.200
depends on the volume of sales in the natural indicators and the price at which the product or service is sold.

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:09.200
It is impossible for the financial director to regulate the rate of net profitability.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.200
In this case, a collegial approach is necessary,

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:18.200
when the financial director can report the task of the shareholders

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:26.200
on the value or normative indicator of net profitability of sales and net profitability of assets.

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:33.200
This is regarding the topic of the company's capital and its way of formation.
