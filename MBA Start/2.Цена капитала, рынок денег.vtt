00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The second part of the question is about the price of financial resources.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
The top manager should know the price of financial resources for his company for the following reasons.

00:13.000 --> 00:23.000
The first is that the price of the capital is the return on investment by investors in the company's activities.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
The manager should anticipate possible changes in the price of shares depending on the expected return on investment and dividends.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
In the first part of the question we discussed the situation of the price of the company's own capital.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
The company can use both its own and borrowed capital as speculative capital.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
It can buy shares at a low price and sell them at a high price after receiving positive dividends.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
The second reason is the price of borrowed capital.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
The price of borrowed capital is associated with the interest paid.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
Therefore, it is necessary to choose the best option out of several options to attract investors.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
If we look at the current situation of the financial market in Russia,

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
we can see that the interest rate in the currency is 5-6%.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
However, banks say that you should borrow money from the bank.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
Banks say that you should borrow money from the bank.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
This is due to the fact that these currencies are very conservative and do not change the rate in the least.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
The interest rate in the currency is 5-6%.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
Therefore, the top manager should assume that the price of the borrowed resources is associated with the interest paid.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
The manager responsible for the loan policy of the company should propose solutions related to the best possible outcome.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
The manager responsible for the loan policy of the company should propose solutions related to the best possible outcome.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
The price of financial resources is one of the key factors in the analysis of investment projects and planning of the company's financial budget.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
In 2005 and 2006, the average price of $1 million was $28.70,

03:30.000 --> 03:40.000
which is not comparable to the current $1 million.

03:40.000 --> 03:48.000
The current $1 million is $1.5 million.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
The current $1 million is $1.5 million.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
This is the decrease in the current $1 million.

04:04.000 --> 04:14.000
The interest rate in one currency and the non-interest rate in another currency should be associated with the interest rates

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
and the foreign currency exchange rate, which we consider as an alternative.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
Investment projects related to the acquisition of new equipment and the launch of new production,

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
projects related to the promotion of their own products to the foreign market,

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
should be taken into account.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
If we consider the company's financial budget as part of its current activities,

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
we should consider the fact that the company's current activities are not related to the current activities.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
The next slide shows the information on how the central bank's refinancing rate has changed from 2002 to 2007.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
The central bank's refinancing rate has decreased from 25% to 10% on June 19, 2007.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
The rate depends on the level of inflation in the country.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
This is an achievement of the authorities and the regulatory body of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation,

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
which provides a corresponding rate on commercial loan resources provided by non-financial organizations on the Russian market.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
Today, the average loan rate of the Central Bank of Russian enterprises is somewhere around 2% of the base rate of the Central Bank.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
In terms of the value of the company's financial resources, we are focusing on the loan resources provided by non-financial organizations on the Russian market.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
We are focusing on the loan resources provided by non-financial organizations on the Russian market.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
We should take into account the dynamics of the loan agreements and the loan agreements.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
In the case of a change in the Central Bank's refinancing rate,

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
the borrower has the right to claim a reduction in the interest rate,

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
and the Central Bank has the right to increase the interest rate on the loan provided to the client.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
The next slide shows the factual information on the loan agreements.

07:09.000 --> 07:17.000
The next slide shows the factual information on the loan agreements.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
The Central Bank of the Russian Federation has provided factual information on the loan agreements of non-financial organizations,

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
that is, Russian enterprises, in 2007.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
The Central Bank of Russia has provided factual information on the loan agreements of non-financial organizations,

07:40.000 --> 07:48.000
that is, Russian enterprises, in 2007.

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
The Central Bank of Russia has provided factual information on the loan agreements of non-financial organizations,

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
that is, Russian enterprises, in 2007.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
The dynamics are such that the money we deposit in banks can only be saved,

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
but not multiplied.

08:18.000 --> 08:26.000
The interest rate is not even equal to the current inflation rate in the country.

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
At least, the losses are minimized.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
Of course, for the current operation of enterprises,

08:42.000 --> 08:50.000
the interest rates are acceptable,

08:50.000 --> 08:58.000
but the interest rates of the Central Bank of Russia were 210%,

08:58.000 --> 09:06.000
and all credit resources were equal to the dollar equivalent or were allocated in currency.

09:06.000 --> 09:14.000
This is a good example of how the financial market allows companies to plan their activities more effectively,

09:14.000 --> 09:22.000
to direct the attracted resources with less risks,

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
both in increasing non-return assets and in increasing returns,

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
The next slide shows the average interest rates of commercial banks on loans for non-financial organizations

09:39.000 --> 09:47.000
and the population in the US dollar.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
We see that the ruble rate for non-financial organizations is somewhat lower,

09:55.000 --> 10:03.000
but if we compare it with the past,

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
the interest rates were 210% annually in rubles and 15-18% in currency.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
At that time, our enterprises were credited in dollars,

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
but now we see a positive trend.

10:28.000 --> 10:36.000
The ruble is strengthening its position and becoming a stable national currency.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
According to experts, the dollar amount of the population is less than 90 billion dollars.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
This is a rather modest figure compared to the previous figure.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
It turns out that the dollar is gradually being washed out and is used only as a means of calculation,

11:04.000 --> 11:12.000
or as a daily need for the wealthy.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
In 2007, the population was credited in dollars by commercial banks with an average supply of 12.5-13.3%.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
This is the most common price of borrowed resources that can be used to attract companies

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
or private individuals to the business.

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
The Central Bank rate determines the commercial rates for loans in rubles and US dollars for the national economy.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
Another promising way to attract additional financial resources to the company's total capital,

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
as well as to the company's debt, is to place corporate debt.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
How effective is this option?

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
First of all, the company is focused on diversifying options for attracting financial resources.

12:27.000 --> 12:35.000
On the other hand, it is potentially ready to give a certain amount of transparency to the company's economic operations,

12:35.000 --> 12:43.000
so that the debtors are sure that the debtor's risk is acceptable and that he can pay his debts.

12:44.000 --> 12:52.000
The slide shows the characteristics of how to place corporate debt.

13:02.000 --> 13:10.000
In particular, it is assumed that it is advisable to attract consultants who can provide the necessary support in two main areas.

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
First of all, lawyers who register and issue documents to the Federal Financial Markets Service.

13:21.000 --> 13:29.000
The second part of the consultants are specialists from investment and banking units of large banks,

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
who are familiar with the standards of requirements of investors in the stock market for issued bonds.

13:37.000 --> 13:45.000
They can not only help the company prepare for the issuance of corporate bonds,

13:45.000 --> 13:53.000
but also determine the most profitable and acceptable time period for entering the stock market

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
with the proposal of their own debt obligations for sale.

13:57.000 --> 14:05.000
The next participants are involved in the preparation of the so-called IPO.

14:05.000 --> 14:15.000
The first is the underwriter, who is the co-immitter of the company that issues corporate bonds.

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
The underwriter is a participant of the trade on a particular exchange.

14:23.000 --> 14:31.000
According to the contract with the immitter, he places the securities on behalf of the underwriter,

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
at the request of the client.

14:39.000 --> 14:49.000
The financial intermediary offers the securities to the RAO of the EU or the RAO of Gazprom

14:49.000 --> 14:59.000
at the RTS or MMVB fund and sells them on behalf of the underwriter.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
In Russian practice, there are rare cases when a pool or a group of underwriters

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
consists of three or four investment banks that organize the placement together.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
It is clear that this increases the size of the commission.

15:15.000 --> 15:25.000
On the other hand, the pool of underwriters is a certain guarantee or a positive recommendation for the stock market,

15:25.000 --> 15:37.000
when a serious company with a good business reputation offers debt obligations to a particular immitter.

15:37.000 --> 15:47.000
The choice of the financial intermediary is one of the most important stages of the preparation of the corporate bonds,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
but we should not make a mistake here.

15:49.000 --> 15:57.000
We should take into account the experience of the current players of the underwriting market.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
If we consider the results of the work in Russia in 2006,

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
the corporate bonds were imitated for 11 billion dollars,

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
along with the corporate shares that were placed on the Russian funding platforms.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
The company Troika Dialog is the leader.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
There is a link to the underwriting characteristics on the slide,

16:29.000 --> 16:41.000
where you can see the rating of underwriters and find out what conditions and for how long the preparation takes place,

16:41.000 --> 16:49.000
and what the cost of providing services from the underwriter can be.

16:50.000 --> 17:02.000
The fund platform or the stock exchange is also involved in the preparation of the release of corporate bonds.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
The stock exchange is the place of the organization of trading when the securities are placed.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
The stock exchange provides the appropriate immitters with assistance,

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
on the one hand, from the development of the conditions,

17:19.000 --> 17:30.000
how to inform the players of the market, how to conduct marketing events to prepare the market for placement,

17:30.000 --> 17:40.000
and how to place the bonds on the stock exchange.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
There is an auction order for determining the price of placing the bonds,

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
which allows companies that imitate corporate bonds to attract resources at a more optimal market price.

17:56.000 --> 18:04.000
The slide shows a link to the Russian trading system exchange,

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
where you can read the list of trading participants and conduct a selection analysis,

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
for example, on the industry aspect or on the size of the business of those companies that imitated corporate bonds,

18:21.000 --> 18:33.000
and get acquainted with the percentage level that was achieved when placing the bonds on this trading platform.

18:33.000 --> 18:42.000
Interestingly, if we consider the purpose of placing corporate bonds,

18:43.000 --> 18:51.000
in order to minimize the amount of costs associated with the reward of the underwriter,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
as well as the commission of the exchange,

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
the threshold level of profitability, activity and net profit that the company receives

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
should amount to at least $20 million per year.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
In this case, we say that the effect of the scale can be achieved,

19:13.000 --> 19:21.000
and the amount of savings on interest rates from placing corporate bonds

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
will allow the underwriter to cover various commissions,

19:25.000 --> 19:39.000
such as the commission of the exchange, where the trading of corporate bonds took place.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
In this case, if we have smaller volumes of business,

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
it is more reasonable to use traditional methods of attracting additional financial resources

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
as a borrowed capital, working with commercial banks,

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
or imitating the volume of VEXs that each company can make

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
and that does not require the state registration of the Federal Service for Financial Markets.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
In addition to the exchange and the underwriter, the underwriter is also involved in the depository,

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
the registrar, the account depository and the account bank.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
The next slide shows the approximate price level

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
that implies the issuance of corporate bonds.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
We can, accordingly, orient ourselves to what costs are necessary

20:35.000 --> 20:46.000
for registration at the fund and preparation of the issuance of corporate bonds.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
To compare, when considering the options of borrowing on the financial market,

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
the financial director must take into account that the bank transaction is closed

20:59.000 --> 21:06.000
and regulated only by the contractual relations between the borrower and the bank.

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
At the same time, the company can get a lot of indirect benefits

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
in the case of choosing the option of placing corporate bonds.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
This is due to the fact that most investors who consider the feasibility

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
of placing their free financial resources in corporate bonds

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
will familiarize themselves with the state of the company's business,

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
will recommend to their clients to buy these bonds or buy these bonds on their behalf.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
This will indirectly affect the growth of the recognition

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
and therefore the growth of the business value of the company

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
that imitates the bonds on the financial market.

21:57.000 --> 22:08.000
In the case of placing shares, the legislation requires the existence of shareholders

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
who have the right to buy shares of a new issue for 45 days.

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
This is if the issuer issues a share issue to the fund market

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
and the shareholders can buy it for 45 days.

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
Another point is that the Russian legislation imposes restrictions on advertising new issues

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
until the date of their state registration.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
But the company can attract attention to its main activities

22:43.000 --> 22:50.000
through various advertising techniques in the media

22:50.000 --> 23:02.000
without mentioning the fact that the issue of securities is to be issued to the fund market.

23:03.000 --> 23:12.000
Therefore, when we see the advertisement of the Kavdorsky GOKO on central TV,

23:12.000 --> 23:20.000
when the MDM group, for example, placed the issuance of corporate securities on the fund site,

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
this ad might seem strange to the average person,

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
but it provides a lot of information for the professional fund market participants

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
about the reasons for the ad.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
Today, the Federal Service for Financial Markets is the successor

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
of the Federal Commission for the Market of Valuable Papers.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
If we are talking about a list of documents that the Federal Service for Financial Markets

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
should submit, we can find this information on the Federal Service for Financial Markets

24:02.000 --> 24:12.000
official website or ask consultants who provide the relevant legal services

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
to prepare the issuance of corporate securities.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
This slide shows the schedule of the stages of the organization of the primary placement,

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
the stages themselves and the sequence of actions.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
We can turn to the eighth item, regarding the PR of the event,

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
which is that throughout all stages, the support and information of the market,

24:44.000 --> 24:51.000
the support and information of potential buyers, who are the final buyers of securities,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
is carried out constantly.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
This allows the market to prepare for the appropriate moment

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
when it will be necessary to buy a certain amount of imitated securities,

25:06.000 --> 25:14.000
either shares to increase its own capital or bonds to increase its borrowed capital.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
If you pay attention, you will find information about the so-called national IPOs

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
on the Reserve Bank of the Russian Federation, the Rosneft oil company,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
or the Vneshtorkbank.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
This was done on a regular basis earlier,

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
that is, the period of time is on average measured from 12 months to 6 months,

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
when the market was informed about the upcoming event.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
This slide shows the IPOs' orientation dates.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
On average, the schedule of the issuance of bonds is no less than 125 days,

25:59.000 --> 26:06.000
which is the maximum time required for a full preparation,

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
so that there are no fragments or shortcomings in this procedure.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
As a rule, the preparation of this procedure takes at least one year,

26:22.000 --> 26:30.000
when the first half is the pre-project or pre-processing procedure,

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
where all the relevant documents need to be prepared,

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
when the company needs to be set up to work in accordance with the requirements

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
of the fund market for disclosure of information,

26:46.000 --> 26:53.000
and to be ready for joint work without failures

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
and to conduct the issuance of corporate bonds or shares of the company

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
in a productive manner.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
The choice of the scheme and the conditions of the placement.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
Here we consider the question of the money related to the price,

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
which we will be given to implement either the tactical tasks

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
or the strategic tasks.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
The slide shows an example of the Russian trading system.

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
The conditions of the placement of securities may vary depending on the primary placement,

27:36.000 --> 27:46.000
when it is possible to place corporate bonds with pre-deposit of money and securities,

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
or without pre-deposit of money and securities.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
The place of the accounting of securities on securities may be in the accounting depository,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
in the registrar's office or in another depository.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
The order of determining the price of securities placed

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
either at a fixed price or with the determination of the price of securities at the auction.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
The next slide shows the scheme of placing securities on the conditions of pre-deposit.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
When investors transfer money to the accounting bank in advance,

28:23.000 --> 28:30.000
the accounting bank makes payments between the participants of the trading platform

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
and purchases securities exclusively within these funds.

28:35.000 --> 28:47.000
There is no situation when you can buy more than you have left in the accounting bank for this transaction.

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
This method is the most common and sometimes it is called the exchange method.

28:54.000 --> 29:02.000
When the emitter receives the collected money from the underwriter from his account in the accounting bank

29:02.000 --> 29:10.000
and in return makes a delivery to the underwriter, participants or purchasers of securities

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
can buy securities at the fund of the corresponding amount,

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
either of corporate bonds or shares.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
The next slide shows the scheme of placing securities on the conditions of delivery against payment.

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
In this case, we say that the seller must reserve securities to the set date of the accounts,

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
and the buyer must reserve money in the accounting bank.

29:35.000 --> 29:41.000
On the day of the accounts, the clearing center of the exchange checks the presence of securities and money

29:41.000 --> 29:48.000
on both sides and, if necessary, gives an indication of the simultaneous transfer of assets.

29:48.000 --> 29:57.000
In this case, the situation is also excluded when either side does not fulfill its own obligations.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
If we recall the situation in the mid-1990s,

30:04.000 --> 30:12.000
there were many cases in the press when either side did not fulfill its own obligations

30:12.000 --> 30:23.000
either on the delivery of securities or on the amount of funds that the underwriter had to pay,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
and, accordingly, the emitter on the issued securities.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Today, such situations are practically excluded.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Placing securities on the conditions of free delivery.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
This scheme can be implemented as a prepayment,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
when first the buyer transfers money to the seller,

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
and then the seller gives the order to the investor to transfer securities.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
The inconvenience of the scheme is the disadvantageous position of the buyer,

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
who first separates from his money, and only then receives the securities.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
At the same time, if the deal is free delivery,

30:59.000 --> 31:11.000
then the buyer may have various preferences related to the auction price of the securities

31:11.000 --> 31:20.000
and other conditions that the buyer can additionally bargain with the emitter.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
The dilemma is whether to choose a financial price or an auction.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
What should be chosen for the issuance of corporate bonds?

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
On the one hand, to minimize the cost of the financial resources,

31:35.000 --> 31:45.000
and on the other hand, to guarantee that the issued volume of the issuance of corporate bonds will be really placed.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
There are two ways to determine the price of the issuance.

31:50.000 --> 31:58.000
On the one hand, this is a fixed price, and the fixed price is determined by the board of directors of the issuer company,

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
that is, the one that issues the bonds.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
The fixed price is constant until the beginning of the issuance, it does not change.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
The second option is the price of the auction, which is determined during the auction.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
At the moment, most of the deposits on Russian stock exchanges are made at a certain price in advance.

32:19.000 --> 32:30.000
Few imitators with a developed market of their own securities decide to hold auctions to determine the price of the sale.

32:30.000 --> 32:38.000
This is mainly due to the fact that the board of directors, which represents the interests of the owners of the company,

32:38.000 --> 32:46.000
can set an acceptable price in terms of efficiency for the attracted financial resources.

32:46.000 --> 32:54.000
If the price is not higher, it is beneficial for the company,

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
and if the price does not meet the expectations of the board of directors,

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
then alternative ways of attracting resources can be used.

33:03.000 --> 33:10.000
Accordingly, many companies follow a conservative path, namely, by determining the fixed price.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
At the same time, the auction is the prospect of the future.

33:17.000 --> 33:24.000
It often happens that the market reacts to interesting debt obligations,

33:24.000 --> 33:32.000
associated, say, with the extensive growth of large companies or basic industry companies.

33:32.000 --> 33:42.000
Investors compete for the purchase of securities and are ready to provide a large amount of financial resources

33:43.000 --> 33:52.000
to the guaranteed debt of the imitators and buy them at extremely profitable prices,

33:52.000 --> 34:04.000
based on the minimum fee for the service of the debt to the imitators on the financial resources provided by the investors.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
The technology of fixed price IPO.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
There are a large number of options for determining the fixed price.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.000
It can be indicated in dollars, or it can be tied to some economic indicator,

34:20.000 --> 34:27.000
such as the barrel of oil or the Trojan horse of gold, the Trojan horse of silver.

34:28.000 --> 34:36.000
A new price can be set every day, or it can be determined based on the pre-declared buyers' claims.

34:36.000 --> 34:44.000
The value of the price is unknown until the end of the auction.

34:45.000 --> 34:57.000
Therefore, many Russian companies choose the method of placing the value of the securities at a fixed, pre-determined price.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.000
In the case of using an auction, when the company is focused on the possibility or favorable conditions

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000
for placing its debt obligations or corporate shares under more acceptable and more favorable conditions,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
the following sequence of actions takes place.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
The slide shows three main stages.

35:21.000 --> 35:33.000
First, on the day of the initial placement, potential buyers submit their own claims to the trading system for the purchase of securities.

35:34.000 --> 35:40.000
The trading system then summarizes the claims and gives them to the underwriter,

35:40.000 --> 35:50.000
who then presents the interest of the issuer to the summary register of claims with the price indication.

35:50.000 --> 35:56.000
The underwriter, with the issuer, on the basis of the summary register of claims for the purchase,

35:56.000 --> 36:05.000
determines the point of sale, when the price corresponds to the maximum amount of the attracted funds,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
that is, the most acceptable level.

36:08.000 --> 36:18.000
At the same time, all the claims that are fulfilled at the same time by the underwriter are fulfilled.

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
In the case of an auction method of price formation, the value is unknown until the end of the auction.

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
The types of auctions are presented on the slide as three possible options.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
Based on the submitted claim, when the claims can be limited and can be market claims.

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
Limited claims are when the buyer specifies the desired price.

36:52.000 --> 36:59.000
Market claims are when the buyer specifies the amount he would like to spend on the purchase of securities,

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
agreeing to any price that is set as a result of the auction.

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
As a rule, market claims are distributed on state securities.

37:12.000 --> 37:20.000
The second type of auction is when the application for the purchase is visible to all participants,

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
or only to the underwriter with the issuer.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
That is, the open type of auction and the closed type of auction.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
And the third type of auction is based on the principle of price determination.

37:33.000 --> 37:41.000
In this case, we are talking about determining the price level and satisfying the application based on the price of the cutoff.

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
When the issuer and the underwriter determine the price of the cutoff after the collection of all claims

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
and determine the average price for these claims.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
To summarize the second part of the question on the price of money,

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
we can state that the debt is valuable, primarily because it is used to serve one's own debt.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
If we work with credit organizations, it is connected with the payment of interest to the banks that serve our debt.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
If we work with corporate securities, it is connected with the level of profitability,

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
which is determined by the issuer himself or by the investors of the auctions on the exchange.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
Depending on the volume of the resources, the size of the business of the borrower,

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
one can choose a form of attracting borrowing resources.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
The threshold value is $20 million in net profit.

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
If the companies have not yet achieved this level of profitability,

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
it is recommended to work with banks, to diversify the credit portfolio between several banks,

39:26.000 --> 39:32.000
to choose the most favorable conditions for the banks that will give more profitable interest rates,

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
lending conditions, terms, amounts, and renewable or non-renewable credit lines.

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
If we have the opportunity to declare the net profit of more than $20 million,

39:45.000 --> 39:51.000
we can already claim more effective attraction of financial resources from the bond market,

39:56.000 --> 40:02.000
when investors will buy our debt on lower rates than commercial interest rates in credit organizations.

40:03.000 --> 40:09.000
In addition to direct benefits, we also get indirect benefits,

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
which can increase the valuation of the business.

40:32.000 --> 40:38.000
For one simple objective reason, the company must be transparent,

40:38.000 --> 40:44.000
and ready to work according to the requirements of the bond market,

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
which means disclosure of information and a certain level of transparency.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
The third part of the questions is about the money market.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
I would like to draw your attention to the slide.

41:13.000 --> 41:19.000
Depending on the macroeconomic conditions, the cost of money can be different.

41:19.000 --> 41:25.000
At the same time, as historical examples, we can draw the following conclusions.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
In post-war Germany, the inflation rate was up to 20,000% per year,

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
and money was issued in huge quantities, primarily in weight.

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
There were cases when people left their money carts outside to go to the store,

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
and when they left the store, the money was on the roadside,

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
and the cart was privatized or expropriated.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
This is hyperinflationary economy.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
In the crisis, if the state needs to issue additional bonds,

42:21.000 --> 42:27.000
which will lead to an increase in inflation,

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
the level of commercial loans will increase.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
If the central bank's base rate increases,

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
the base rate of commercial loans increases,

42:41.000 --> 42:47.000
and the chain reaction to increase prices for goods and services begins.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
At the same time, financial instruments are looking for a more stable base.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
This is expressed in stable foreign currencies.

42:57.000 --> 43:05.000
Therefore, the main factors determining the cost of money are inflation and the state of the national economy.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
The following slide presents three main reasons for the growth of the fund market as a source of financing in Russia.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
First of all, we highlight the growth of international investment ratings in Russia,

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Russian issuers and their debt instruments,

43:23.000 --> 43:29.000
and the stability of the economy over the past six years

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
allows us to assure Western large investors,

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
primarily conservative investors who invest in state-owned debt,

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
that the stability of the economy will continue.

43:45.000 --> 43:53.000
The stable price level allows us to predict the future profit of the Russian budget,

43:53.000 --> 43:59.000
which means that the Russian economy will become extremely attractive for investment.

43:59.000 --> 44:07.000
Today, American investors and Western investors invest dollars in the Russian economy.

44:07.000 --> 44:15.000
The dollar is devalued, but is now converted into rubles.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
In addition to the declared profitability of the fund market,

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
which is on average 20-30% per annum,

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
Western foreign investors receive additional income from the devaluation of the dollar.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
The euro is in a different situation.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
The euro is in a more conservative position,

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
and the exchange rate for the ruble is increasing.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
On average, the euro is worth 34-35 rubles.

44:51.000 --> 45:01.000
Therefore, the Russian fund market is a proposal of foreign financial resources

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
for the development of the Russian economy.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
That is why 2006 was the year of the highest foreign investment in Russia,

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
estimated at $40-50 billion per year.

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
At this rate, no economy in the world is growing,

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
I mean at the rate of foreign investment.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
If this trend persists for the next two or three years,

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
it will be possible to state that the Russian economy has become the most attractive for investment in the world.

45:39.000 --> 45:47.000
This automatically means a reduction in the cost of financial resources for borrowers within Russia.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
The second objective factor is the reduction of risks and the increase in the level of trust

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
between Russian and international investors in debt.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
Today, there are practically no corporate defaults on debt,

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
and the market reacts very clearly to the reduction of prices on financial resources

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
precisely due to the market's quality characteristics.

46:15.000 --> 46:21.000
When debt is mostly imitated by conscientious borrowers,

46:21.000 --> 46:27.000
it is possible to work at an acceptable level of profitability

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
at the required quality level of borrowers.

46:31.000 --> 46:41.000
2005 is considered the year of the initial stage of the Russian debt market's exit to a new level of quality

46:41.000 --> 46:49.000
precisely due to the fact that foreign potential has entered the Russian trading platforms,

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
and Russian companies have gained access to foreign financial resources.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
The next slide shows the main trends of the securities market.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
It is possible to predict that this trend will persist for the next three years.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
First, it is a rapid increase in the number of issuances.

47:09.000 --> 47:17.000
We are currently observing a very rapid and systematic centralization of various groups of companies.

47:17.000 --> 47:25.000
We see the increase in shareholder capital not only due to the current activities of individual companies,

47:25.000 --> 47:33.000
but also due to the voluntary purchase of individual companies.

47:33.000 --> 47:41.000
In addition, we can clearly see an increase in the average volume of one issuance.

47:41.000 --> 47:49.000
Today, the average volume of an issuance is about 1 billion rubles,

47:49.000 --> 47:59.000
which is when companies place bonds or carry out additional shares in this volume.

47:59.000 --> 48:07.000
This indicates that the quality and volume of the resources attracted to one conditional issuer is increasing.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
In addition, we can see a decrease in the exit cost of long-term investments,

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
due to the fact that the largest underwriters are entering the game,

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
and through their subsidiary companies or direct participation in the institutional capital of other underwriters,

48:23.000 --> 48:31.000
they are implementing a certain damping policy in the area of pricing for obtaining a certain client field.

48:31.000 --> 48:37.000
In the future, the cost of long-term investments will decrease.

48:37.000 --> 48:45.000
The following slide shows four basic financing schemes that Russian companies can use.

48:45.000 --> 48:53.000
The most popular is the traditional banking lending scheme,

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
the second is the VEX program, the third is the bonds, and the fourth is the IPO procedure.

49:00.000 --> 49:08.000
Ideally, a Russian company that is focused on diversification of loans,

49:08.000 --> 49:15.000
both banking loans and corporate bonds, VEX programs,

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
should, of course, follow all four methods of attracting financing.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
Let's take a closer look at each of them.

49:26.000 --> 49:36.000
The first is that we need to set certain criteria or signs of choosing a credit source.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
There are four basic criteria.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
First of all, the cost of financing,

49:44.000 --> 49:50.000
everything that concerns the interest rate on the debt service,

49:50.000 --> 50:00.000
and the costs of the zero cycle, when it is necessary to pay or bear the costs related to the preparation of transactions.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
The second is the term of financing.

50:03.000 --> 50:10.000
We see that over the past five years,

50:10.000 --> 50:19.000
the term of financing has been increasing very actively by Russian investors and borrowers.

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
The terms of financing are becoming more and more similar to the Western standards.

50:26.000 --> 50:33.000
The third criterion is the funding that is necessary to attract funds.

50:33.000 --> 50:41.000
The bond funding, the third party's assignment, is considered the most acceptable.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
In addition, the Insurance Companies Institute works,

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
when the risks of non-return of the funds are insured.

50:51.000 --> 51:04.000
In addition, various assignments are possible from informal but organized financial groups

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
based on regional associations and associations of entrepreneurs

51:10.000 --> 51:18.000
that have corresponding funds for the development of their own members

51:18.000 --> 51:27.000
through the provision of collective guarantees under the assignment of the obligations of the separate members of such associations.

51:27.000 --> 51:33.000
The terms of financing that are necessary for the organization of the attraction of financing are the fourth criterion.

51:33.000 --> 51:41.000
It is also evident that, on the one hand, depending on the type of financing,

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
the terms begin to acquire clearly defined characteristics.

51:47.000 --> 51:57.000
In the previous question, we considered that at least 125 days are necessary to prepare the issuance of corporate bonds.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
If we consider the relationship with commercial banks,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
many companies, within the framework of financial and economic services,

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
build measurable processes of interaction with banks to receive loans.

52:11.000 --> 52:18.000
Therefore, the terms become clear and predictable.

52:19.000 --> 52:26.000
It is possible to make a plan for the budget and the movement of money,

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
when and at what time it is necessary to start negotiations

52:29.000 --> 52:36.000
in order to get the opportunity to either re-lend or not allow cash outages.

52:36.000 --> 52:43.000
The characteristics of a commercial bank as one of the most common financing options

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
can be distinguished by the following advantages.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
First, there are no significant overhead expenses.

52:50.000 --> 52:57.000
Since the enterprise has a balanced interaction with the service bank,

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
the bank usually knows the financial state of the borrower,

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
sees the money flows that the borrower has,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
the intensity of income and spending of funds,

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
and knows the seasonality and characteristics of the borrower's payment ability.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
In addition, the simplicity and speed of the transaction registration can be distinguished as an advantage.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
There is no requirement for the state registration of such transactions.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
That is, there is no public transaction between the credit organization and the borrower.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
What are the disadvantages?

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
First, there are small loans.

53:37.000 --> 53:44.000
This is due to the fact that the bank is limited in allocating the necessary financial resources,

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
for example, for the strategic development of the company,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
the amount of assets at the company's disposal,

53:50.000 --> 53:57.000
the turnover of financial resources that go through the account of a client in a particular bank,

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
and the amount of net profit that the borrower receives

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
and declares in the mandatory accounting for the last five dates,

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
which are first transferred to the credit committee,

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
and then to the control of the money circulation department in the commercial bank.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
That is, compared to other options for attracting financial resources,

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
the bank loan has the biggest disadvantage, namely, small loans.

54:28.000 --> 54:35.000
First of all, these restrictions are introduced for commercial banks by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation,

54:35.000 --> 54:47.000
which regulates and strictly regulates the ways of assessing the creditability of the borrower in various internal departmental instructions,

54:47.000 --> 54:53.000
as well as the attribution to various categories when determining the reserve for possible loss of assets.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
The average loan term is one year,

54:56.000 --> 55:02.000
but today banks issue longer loans.

55:02.000 --> 55:13.000
In addition, the need to pay interest payments for the maintenance of the debt can be seen as a disadvantage.

55:13.000 --> 55:19.000
In other cases, payments can be made at the end of the term,

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
or payments can be made in a quarterly manner, if we consider the mandatory loan.

55:25.000 --> 55:34.000
High interest rates, compared to what exists today in the market in alternative ways of attracting financial resources,

55:34.000 --> 55:40.000
and, of course, the need for a deposit or a third party order for the borrower,

55:40.000 --> 55:47.000
or a third party deposit for the provision of bonds to the borrower in front of the banks.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
These are the characteristics of a bank loan.

55:50.000 --> 56:04.000
But today, a bank loan is the most common and safest scheme of interaction between banks and borrowers in the market.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
The characteristics of exchange programs.

56:08.000 --> 56:18.000
The undeniable advantage is the simplicity and efficiency of attracting funds through the exchange program.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
At the same time, there is no registration of the issuance of VXLs,

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
which is the company's personal business,

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
regarding the time at which VXLs should be issued and the conditions.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
The third advantage is the absence of a limitation on the volume of the issuance.

56:37.000 --> 56:44.000
No one can regulate the volume of VXLs issued in the company, except for shareholders.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
Shareholders can determine the limit.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.000
Very often, VXLs are the preliminary stage for preparing bonds.

56:55.000 --> 57:07.000
When a VXL is transferred to the operating players of exchange trades on various fund platforms,

57:08.000 --> 57:18.000
they provide financial consultations and intermediary services, register the issuance and cancellation of VXLs,

57:18.000 --> 57:29.000
monitor the transfer notes and can say exactly when and in which organization the VXL was transferred,

57:29.000 --> 57:40.000
and simultaneously carry out verification procedures for VXL payment.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
It should be noted that VXL is a more liquid instrument than a loan,

57:46.000 --> 57:52.000
because the interaction between the VXL issuer, the company that imitated VXL,

57:53.000 --> 58:03.000
and the market has a larger circle of companies than the deal of the loaner.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
What are the disadvantages?

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
First of all, it is necessary to conduct an examination of the authenticity,

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
correctness and reliability of the transfer note chain in the VXL itself.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
It is an extremely expensive, tedious and complex procedure.

58:22.000 --> 58:29.000
At the same time, if this procedure is carried out by a financial intermediary,

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
and a financial intermediary is our future potential underwriter,

58:33.000 --> 58:44.000
that is, he looks at the undeclared and unregistered volume of the issuance of these debt obligations of a particular company,

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
he can predict what will happen to the corporate debt.

58:48.000 --> 58:56.000
In this case, this is a certain guarantee of the subsequent success of the corporate issuance of bonds.

58:56.000 --> 59:04.000
The second very important drawback that must be taken into account is that VXL is the least protected instrument.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
Since VXL is issued in a documented form,

59:09.000 --> 59:18.000
the documentation of VXL is often accompanied by a fake VXL,

59:18.000 --> 59:28.000
when VXL, by all appearances, can say that it was issued by a reliable company,

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
but at the same time it can be a beautiful fake.

59:31.000 --> 59:45.000
When the term of VXL cancellation does not coincide with the specified date in the document,

59:45.000 --> 59:56.000
when one of the mandatory signs as a condition for VXL cancellation is absent,

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
when the signatures of the first parties do not coincide, etc.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Such VXLs are called bronze VXLs.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And, of course, if we are going to issue VXLs for the outside world,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000
we need consultations and support from external experts,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and the recommendations on the issue of VXLs for the outside world

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
are based on the fact that we need a competent and reliable financial mediator.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Companies that carry out underwriting on Russian stock markets can provide us with such services.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.000
The main advantage of issuing shares is the absence of the need to pay interest.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000
By issuing shares, we voluntarily include new members of the shareholders.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And it is clear that shares do not imply paying interest for the amount of money.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Shareholders, buying shares of the company at their own risk,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
hope for the growth of the value of these shares,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and have the right to influence the decisions of the managers or the hiring team of employees of the company.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Another advantage is the absence of the need to pay interest.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Not only interest, but also the return of the money.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
If we sell shares on the free market,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
in order to return the money to the investor,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
it is possible to sell the securities to other investors,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and there is no guarantee that they will be sold at a higher price.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But there are certain disadvantages.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
The main disadvantage is the need for transparency in the company's activities.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
The disadvantage is not that openness is bad.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The disadvantage is that openness and transparency are expensive for the company.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The company must make a lot of transformations,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
certainly related to capital investments,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
in order to meet the requirements of openness and transparency.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Perhaps the second disadvantage is the deflation of capital.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000
When we get some kind of uncontrollability when holding a meeting of shareholders,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
when various points of decision-making appear,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000
which may not be comparable to the opinion of the company's management,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
may not be comparable to the opinion of the company's main shareholders,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
but by law, we must take into account the interests of the minority,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
otherwise they can paralyze the company's work through various court proceedings.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000
In addition, the third disadvantage is the need for state registration of the issuance of shares,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000
which means additional costs for specialized services of consultants

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
for the preparation of documents for the Federal Service for Financial Markets

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and the preparation of the necessary quarterly reports.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The next slide shows the main characteristics of issuing bonds.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000
In terms of benefits, we highlight the attraction of significant funds.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:44.000
A bond loan is not bound by the company's ability to determine the maximum amount of loans

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
according to the assets at its disposal.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
In this case, if the company declares its own liability for loans

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:04.000
plus the affiliated liability of shareholders and other businesses that are at the disposal of shareholders,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
it is possible to attract large amounts of third-party financing,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
which will be the basis for increasing the loan capital.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Bonds allow for a long-term loan,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and the amount of corporate bonds issued in Russia is on average 3 years.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
State securities have a life expectancy of several decades.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
If our companies had a flawless business reputation,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
they would certainly use the opportunity to borrow for a long time.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
The next slide shows the creation of a public credit history.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.000
In this case, we say that companies are obliged to meet the requirements for repaying coupons

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
or preliminary payments on bonds.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
At the same time, the information is sent to the credit bureau

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000
on how the company copes or, suddenly, fails to meet its obligations for repaying the debt.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
The absence of real insurance.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Bonds are issued without the need for any assets.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
We do not transfer bonds to real estate.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:29.000
They can be considered and used as collateral for loans in banks.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Another advantage is the ability to manage the size of the debt.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
When the company is independent or, on the order of financial intermediaries,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
can buy out its own bonds in the market,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000
thereby minimizing the amount of debt to be paid on a fixed date.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
What are the disadvantages?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
As with shares, the company's transparency is necessary.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
This means additional preparatory capital costs and the state registration of the issuance of shares,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
which is associated with the preparation of documents and the quarterly report.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And, of course, with the time required to register the volume of the issuance of securities,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
corporate bonds.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
The next slide shows the opportunities for financing for the enterprise of borrowers

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
when entering the securities market.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000
When we say that the company receives, first of all, long-term capital,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
money is always cheaper if it is long-term.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
The second moment is that the company gains publicity.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
The company becomes disciplined.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It is responsible not only for the results of the activities in front of the current shareholders,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:06.000
but also for the extended circle of shareholders or holders of corporate bonds.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
The company has the opportunity to improve its image,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.000
increase trust, and, accordingly, trust of investors will allow to perform tasks

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
to attract the necessary amount of borrowed capital

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
with less costs and less costs in the next period of time.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
This is necessary for financing the company's strategy of development.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.000
The fourth opportunity is that the company has an exit to a more developed capital market.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:48.000
This allows the company to capitalize its value, it becomes open, public,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
and, accordingly, it facilitates its exit to a more developed capital market.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:02.000
First of all, it is on the London fund platform, on the New York fund platform,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
borrowing on the fund platform in Paris.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Let's go back to the company.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
The slide shows the main requirements that the company must meet.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:23.000
First of all, the company that enters the public market must produce competitive and promising products.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It must have a highly qualified team of management.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It must have its own business model of management.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I mean all the procedures related to the organizational structure,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
the procedures related to the description of the main business processes,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the procedures related to planning, budgeting, analysis of the results,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.000
decision-making on deviations, on adjusting the company's development course,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
on changing the normative indicators for individual business processes

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
in terms of their cost and time.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000
The company must exist in the market for a long time within the framework of planned strategic development.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:22.000
The next requirement for the company is that the company's activities must be profitable.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000
This means that all the procedures related to increasing the cost of tax minimization

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
or reducing the part of the revenue from the implementation to reflect the smaller amount of revenue,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and as a result of tax reduction, the base on profits, go to the past.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The company is forced to declare all profits, and, accordingly, pay taxes on profits,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
but also demonstrate to investors that the company's performance is positive.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
The company must have a strong financial control system.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
This is primarily due to the company's qualifications and performance of the middle management level,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and means the use of the management accounting methodology, financial controlling,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
which will allow the company to control the existing cash flow.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The accounting system must be approved when the company's standards for management accounting

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and public accounting must be developed.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The last requirement is that the company must provide the financial information to the interested users,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
which is the shareholders, creditors, and possibly their employees,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000
if they are a part of the obligatory category of persons to whom the company's financial information is provided.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Not all the company's assets can be reflected in the asset complex.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000
In the next slide, we will see why the Russian accounting system does not allow

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
to provide fully reliable information about the company's financial state.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
In this case, apart from the traditional standards of accounting,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000
there should be a part of the management information provided to the interested parties,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and the company should be involved in leasing transactions.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
After a certain period of time, the size of non-returnable assets will be increased

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
by the amount of the main funds used in the leasing process.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Very often, the assessment of the assets of our companies does not reflect their fair value.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Russian companies are often undervalued.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
This is due to the lack of business reputation of Russian companies,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and the trade marks that are available to the old companies.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The assessment of the main funds is low, and does not reflect the real use of the assets.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:24.000
This is due to the fact that the balance of the main funds may be much lower than their market value.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
One example is the land or know-how patents,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
which is the amount of non-returnable assets that the company has at its disposal.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The assessment of the reserves is usually high,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
since it does not take into account the pure component of the implementation.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:52.000
This means that the super-normative limits or super-normative reserves

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
are already considered non-active or dead-end capital,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
but they also continue to be assessed in terms of the balance of the value.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Although, if such reserves have appeared, they must be evaluated and resold

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
for at least partial replenishment of the cash flow.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
This does not often happen.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
The assessment of the debitor's debt is high, and does not take into account the unreliable debts.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The expenses and the debt can be reflected not in a timely manner,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:30.000
but later, which leads to the increase of the debt.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
We do not reflect the obligations that we have,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
due to the fact that either the documents were not received,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
or in order to maintain the standards set by the shareholders

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
in relation to the debt and the debt.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
At the same time, it is a matter of belief,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
based on the report that our company prepares,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
that everything is in order with our own forces or capital,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
which is formed by a part of the property complex,

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and its share increases accordingly.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Obligations can be misclassified on the term of repayment.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
On the one hand, we assume that we have an extension of the documents,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
but on the other hand, the requirements of the creditors,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
in accordance with violations of certain agreements,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
either verbal or written, require a term of repayment earlier.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
At the same time, we take into account our obligations

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
based on the documents.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
A few words about the potential for financing enterprises.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
The scheme includes division into groups of positive and negative.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
We claim that the company has a positive financial potential,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and we expect to increase the investment attractiveness

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
compared to large public companies.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
They are old players in the market,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
with a conservative policy of attraction.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
New players always use high levels of attention from investors.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
If we go to the open financial market,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
we lack negative information.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Even if we had some contradictions with the service banks,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
this information was not included in the specialized database.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
The sources of information in the credit bureau

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
began to work actively in 2006.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Therefore, we are only an object of positive information.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
We may have a high potential for growth,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
which is also interesting for our investors.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
We have a high level of profitability,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
proven efficiency of the existing management system,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
low systemic level of activity,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and visibility of our business,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
when we clearly predict where our place in the market is,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
what is the share of our market,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and we can openly declare these indicators.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000
We can consider the procedures of working in new markets,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
which means additional business activity,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and as a result of financial components,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
this is a growth in revenue from implementation.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
We have the potential not to use segments of attraction and financing,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
primarily to reduce the cost of the attracted resources.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
At the same time, there are negative components,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
which can negatively affect the potential for financing.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
First, there is a lack of large-scale financing sources.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000
In any case, we will be felt for about two or three years in the market.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
How will we feel under the influence of time?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
How will our financial indicators deteriorate or improve?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
There are hidden and opaque forms of financing.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000
We will have to completely abandon these forms.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:38.000
In case this information suddenly appears in the market,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
we will immediately be on the list of unfavorable potential clients.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
The market can react negatively to us.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
There is a lack of disclosure of our credit history,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
how we worked with the bank.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
There is no negative information, but there is no positive information.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
There is a lack of appreciation of assets and business.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It would be possible to cost more,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
but at the same time it is impossible to prove this market

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
due to the limitation of the presence of time.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
There is a low cost of clean assets

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
due to the underestimation of the company's assets, primarily of the non-returnable block.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
There is a lack of timely management systems and accounting.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
We did not have time and investment opportunities

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
to automate the business.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
There is a possible wear and tear of production capacities.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
There may be a low level of compliance with corporate interests,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
primarily of minority shareholders.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
There is a lack of practice in disclosing information.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
These are negative factors that can have a negative impact

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
on the financing opportunities of our company.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
The next slide shows the financing scheme

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
within the framework of the current planned investment program.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
The algorithm is that if there is an investment program,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
we need the financing parameters.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
The three main parameters are the time, amount and cost.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
If we do not have an investment program,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
we can state that the absence of an investment program

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
means the absence of a formalized strategy.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
In this case, the financing objectives

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
that are at the disposal of the company

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
may have either a project characteristic

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
or be qualified through the financing parameters.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
In any case, we receive requirements

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
on the amount of funds from the financing parameters.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
We may have a positive cash flow or a negative cash flow.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
The positive cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
that can cover all the current expenses.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
The negative cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
that can be compensated for by additional financial loans

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
or by receiving funds from the sale of some assets.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
The negative cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
that can be compensated for by additional financial loans

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
or by receiving funds from the sale of some assets.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
The negative cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
that can be compensated for by additional financial loans.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
At the same time, the financing parameters

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
assume that we are focusing on a long-term repayment.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
To achieve this, we need to form a market

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
that provides information from the underwriter

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
or the bondsman that the emitter or the company

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
that issued the debt is willing to repay the debt

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
in advance or from the emitter.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
This information is then provided to the underwriter

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and the bondman.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
We can use an auction scheme

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
to determine the value of our debt

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
to a particular market instrument

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
or we can determine the interest rate

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
depending on the market condition.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
The market condition is based on the alternative types

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
of loans or those that exist on the fund.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
The next slide shows the main stages of the bond issuance

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
for corporate borrowers.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
The first stage is the decision-making

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
on the issuance of bonds.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
In this case, we need to understand

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
which direction we are going to use

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
the financial resources for.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Or we need to consider the implementation

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
of the investment part of the company's strategy.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
We need to clearly estimate the volume,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
the time and the technology of the work

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
that will be required to acquire new equipment

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
or to buy new land for construction

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
or new production facilities

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
or to place new trading areas.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
The bond issuance is the consequence

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
of the strategy of using the borrowed capital

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
in the company's activities.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
We need to consider the terms of the bond

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and the nominal value of the bond

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
and the interest rates.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
We need to start to disclose the information

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
in the media and to prepare the market.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
We need to consider the risk factors

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
and the risk factors of the bond.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
We need to conclude the corresponding contracts

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
with the organizer, the underwriter,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
the market maker and the payment agent.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
The market maker is the one who creates

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
a favorable image of the event

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
of the placement of securities on the debt market.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The second stage is the state registration

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
of the bond issuance and the transfer of the bonds

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
to the Federal Reserve Bank.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
The State Registration of the Bond Issuance

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
in the Federal Reserve Bank is also necessary.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
The third stage is the preparation

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
of the placement of the bond.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
First, we need to disclose the information

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
in the media and to organize a presentation

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
of the advertising campaign among potential investors

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
and to form a union of participants

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
and intermediaries who will buy out the amount

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
of the bond issuance and will sell the bonds

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
on their behalf.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
We need to conclude the corresponding contracts

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
with the organizer, the market maker

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
and the payment agent.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
The fourth stage is the procedure

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
of placing the bonds in the trading system.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
The fifth stage is the formation of a report

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
on the results of the issuance of the bond.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
The report must be approved and registered

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
by the Federal Reserve Bank.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
The report must be disclosed

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
in the media.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
The sixth stage is the disclosure of the information

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
and the quarterly reports of the issuer

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
on the results of the economic activity.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
The seventh stage is the cancellation of the bond.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
The procedure of the bond market

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
involves a serious organizational transformation

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
within the company.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
The company is forced to abandon

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
some attractive but not promising

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
public open-ended methods of financial activity.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
At the same time, this is associated

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
with the loss of the alleged or hidden profitability

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and the need to disclose the facts

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
of the economic activity and ensure transparency

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
on the results of the quarterly reports

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
for the investors.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
As a result, the company begins to work

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
on the value of its business.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
The company is able to attract the maximum

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
amount of funding to implement ambitious ideas

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
and strategies.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Interestingly, if we consider closed

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000
or so-called non-public companies,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
the large amount of attention of managers

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
is often focused on the regulation

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
of the so-called gray areas

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
or the areas that are at risk

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
of legitimacy or legality of the operation.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
If we consider the activities of public companies,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
the requirements of the law in the area of taxation

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and disclosure of information are taken as a given.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
The company understands that the main center

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
of attention is the growth of business activity.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
This is a business activity focused

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
on the increase in revenue from the implementation

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
as a financial result of business activity.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Managers focus their abilities and professional skills

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
on the creative function of the company,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
which in the end has a positive effect

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
on the company's business.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Therefore, if we are at the stage

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
of the transition to the $20 million

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
revenue-free zone in the current financial year,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
we can think about the effectiveness

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
of further development.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Yes, we can engage in the so-called non-public

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
positions, but in this case we lose

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
the most important thing.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000
We lose the feeling of the expensiveness

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
of our own business, the feeling of self-sufficiency

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
and taking a certain place in the competitive environment

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
of the open, civilized market.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Dear colleagues, today we have discussed

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
the topic of the company's capital and its ways of formation.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I would like to remind you that we have discussed

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
three issues. The first issue was about the source of finance,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
the second was about the price of financial resources,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
and the third issue was about the money market.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Let's summarize what we have discussed today.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
The source of finance is the main way

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
and the main requirement for the development

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
and support of any business of any business organization.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
At the same time, it is considered a loss of business benefit

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
when a company has the appropriate potential

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
to promote its own products or services to the market,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
but has a limitation on financing.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
At the same time, we have discussed that the key factor

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
that affects the efficiency of the company's operation

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
and use of capital is the qualified staff,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
professionalism and experience of the company's leading employees.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
We have also determined that there are two major groups

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
of capital that any business organization uses

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
in its activities.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
The first group is the capital of the company's own

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
and the capital of the company's own.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
At the same time, we have discussed that when the market

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
grows and increases, when the demand for our clients

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
increases, when the volume of products

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
or services produced by our company increases,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
both in terms of natural numbers,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
in terms of the number of orders in one place,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
and the prices at which we can sell our products

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
at a favorable price,

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
companies must use the financial resources

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
that they can borrow for their extensive growth.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
The borrowed capital gives the effect of a financial lever

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
when the payment for its use and operation

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
is small and inalienably less than the net profit

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
that we receive in absolute terms,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
either in rubles or dollars.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We have also discussed that if a company

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
can and is able to use favorable market opportunities,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
then the property complex of the company

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
increases in the conditions of the market growth,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
and the growth of the company's own capital

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
is carried out by the net profit that the company receives,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
by the increasing shareholding capital of the company,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
when the owners can make decisions

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
about the additional volume of the share emission

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
or increase the volume of shares of the shareholders

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
in the established capital.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
When the capital can grow

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
due to the increase in the share of borrowed capital,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
we use short-term and long-term loans

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
and loans of banks, financial organizations,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
investment companies that are ready to buy

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
our corporate bonds,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
when they are ready to use the profit of our company

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
and when the company is a first-class borrower

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
and many banks are willing to work with us.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000
It should also be noted that in addition to net profit

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
as a result of the company's activities,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
it is necessary to work and give maximum management control

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
to such an aspect as the growth of the business value.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
The value of the company's business

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
is determined by the support of the company's publicity,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
openness and transparency.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
On the one hand, it is a mandatory requirement of the market fund

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
when placing bonds or when additional shares are issued.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
But the preparation for the opportunity to work

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
in such conditions requires a certain amount of time

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
and, most importantly, finance.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
The company is forced to abandon dubious financing options

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
when it is focused on a long-term strategy

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
of presence in the market.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
In this case, investors react positively

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000
to the facts and results of the company's economic activities

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
and with great confidence and pleasure

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
acquire the debt obligations of our company.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
As for the market of money,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
we have always said that it is necessary to compare

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
the possible financing methods available to the company.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
We have noted that companies can use

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
traditional banking lending,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
issue or issue their own VXLs,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
or as an alternative,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000
issue and issue their own shares,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
or issue and issue their own bonds.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
When making a decision

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
on the means or sources of financing

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
we will implement our own strategy,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
the company must take into account

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
all the pros and cons,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
and the company must adopt a strategy.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Depending on the working conditions,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
the size of the business,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
the direction of the financing,

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
the use of the capital,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
we must build a financial strategy

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
as a management of capital.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
The financial director of the company

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
and his financial and economic services

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
cannot influence the business activity

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
as a means of making a profit.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
At the same time,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
the management of the company's expenses

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
is a function of the financial and economic services.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
The schemes of minimizing expenses

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
are connected with the increase in labor productivity,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
diversification of types of loans

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
and reduction of maintenance costs

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
of third-party loans,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
expansion of the company's activity

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
due to the effect of reducing the level of constant expenses

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
and the increase in the number of services.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
At the same time,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
the financial director will be powerless

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
if the rate of the return on investment,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
which depends on the volume of sales

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
and the price of the products or services,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
cannot be regulated by the financial director.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
In this case, a collegial approach is necessary

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
when the financial director can report

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
the tasks of the shareholders

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
on the value or normative indicator

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
of the net profitability of sales and assets.
