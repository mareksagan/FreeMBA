00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Hello, my name is Olga Kazeeva. I am an accountant. I have been working as an accountant for more than 15 years.

00:15.000 --> 00:36.000
Today I am a member of the Institute of Professional Accountants of Russia. I have experience in various fields of activity, both construction, production and communication.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
Today we will study the accounting course, the primary documents, contractual activities and their reflection in the account.

00:48.000 --> 01:01.000
Our course will consist of three sections. In the first section, we will discuss some concepts of accounting.

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
In the second section, we will learn about accounting and its analysis.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
In the third section, we will study the accounting and tax accounting.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
We will learn about the primary accounting documents and the economic contracts.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
The tasks we will set are as follows.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
We will learn about the structure of assets and passives of the organization as objects of accounting.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
We will learn about the method of balance generalization and explain the properties of the basic balance equation.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
We will learn about the structure of the accounting balance.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
You will also need to understand the numbers of financial reports.

01:59.000 --> 02:13.000
You will also need to understand the primary accounting documents and their significance for the financial and tax accounting of the organization.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
You will also need to understand the significance of the economic contract in everyday business activity.

02:23.000 --> 02:36.000
Such words as asset, passive, turnover, financial result may seem like Chinese grammar at first glance.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
But it is not as scary and difficult as you may think.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Accounting

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
In general, accounting consists of two simple operations – addition and subtraction.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
We will have to understand and believe this in the following examples.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
You are managers of different levels.

03:04.000 --> 03:15.000
Management is the ability to make decisions based on information about the economic processes that take place at your enterprise.

03:15.000 --> 03:29.000
Accounting is the process of creating information about the financial situation of the organization to the relevant persons who are interested in its activities.

03:29.000 --> 03:38.000
The process of creating information involves a certain procedure that includes the sequence of the accountant's actions,

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
as a result of which the data on the facts of the organization's economic activities are converted into accounting elements.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
We can build a chain of the accountant's actions.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
First, the primary documents are created. Primary documents are not always created by the accountant.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
They are created by managers and other enterprises.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
The primary documents, their data, are put into accounting registers.

04:12.000 --> 04:21.000
The information from the accounting registers is used to form the accounting report of the organization.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
What is it for?

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
The accounting report has its users.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
All users can be divided into two groups – the group of internal users and the group of external users.

04:38.000 --> 04:54.000
The internal users include the management, the financial analysis, accounting information for production or management,

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
the owners of the organization's property, the personnel of the organization, external users, shareholders,

05:04.000 --> 05:15.000
members of the economic societies interested in the financial result, investors, creditors, potential agents,

05:15.000 --> 05:25.000
partners within the framework of the group of interrelated organizations, and, of course, the controlling fiscal bodies,

05:25.000 --> 05:36.000
tax authorities, law enforcement agencies, the audit firms and the statistical bodies.

05:37.000 --> 05:58.000
To satisfy each user, different methods of data grouping and their detailing are used in accordance with the users' requests.

05:59.000 --> 06:09.000
For example, the accounting balance and the profit and loss report are of the greatest interest to the organization's management.

06:09.000 --> 06:22.000
These main reporting forms contain data for two consecutive periods – the past period and the previous reporting period –

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
and allow for direct monitoring of the main performance indicators of the enterprise.

06:30.000 --> 06:42.000
All selection is carried out from the same data, the same data is obtained by different users.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
These data should be identical, but their grouping methods may be different.

06:49.000 --> 07:03.000
Various approaches to grouping and detailing accounting information are provided by the development and introduction of the main and auxiliary forms of analytical accounting accounting.

07:03.000 --> 07:13.000
Let's talk a little more about the groups of users and their economic interests.

07:14.000 --> 07:30.000
The shareholders, who we call the owners of the enterprise, transfer such resources as the investment in the established capital to the economic turnover.

07:30.000 --> 07:49.000
These investments can be financial or material. In addition, the profit received from the enterprise's activities is also allowed to be invested in the enterprise.

07:49.000 --> 08:07.000
Accordingly, the information on the risk of their decision, the profitability they expect to receive from the investments,

08:07.000 --> 08:17.000
the opportunities and the expediency of the organization's investments, and the ability of the organization to pay dividends.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
The next group of users is managers, employees, and the organization's personnel.

08:23.000 --> 08:36.000
What can they invest in the organization? They invest their work, the services they have produced but have not yet paid, or the deposit salary,

08:36.000 --> 08:45.000
the money that remains at the disposal of the enterprise. What information can interest them? Will they get their salary?

08:45.000 --> 08:54.000
What can they invest in the organization? Will they get their salary?

08:54.000 --> 09:10.000
The next group of users is the investors. They invest their money and hope to get some interest from the organization.

09:10.000 --> 09:25.000
They are interested in whether they can temporarily pay the loans they are provided with, whether they will receive the corresponding interest, and whether payments will be made in their favor.

09:25.000 --> 09:39.000
The next group of users is business partners of the organization. They are suppliers, contractors, buyers, customers, and lenders.

09:39.000 --> 09:56.000
This group of users either imports goods by making goods loans, provides advance payments to the organization, or is transferred to the property lending.

09:56.000 --> 10:07.000
They are interested in the information about the payment in advance of the rent, commission payments, and the discount of the sale, and the term of the payment in advance.

10:08.000 --> 10:30.000
Another group of users is the state. They are the tax authorities, the state provides the money,

10:30.000 --> 10:46.000
which is in circulation in the organization, in the amount of the tax obligations, in particular, the single social tax, the deductions to pension funds, and the salaries of workers.

10:46.000 --> 10:55.000
They are interested in how much taxes and fees, duties, excises, and other non-tax payments will be transferred in due time.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
They are interested in the information for statistical monitoring.

11:17.000 --> 11:32.000
When can an accounting account be organized? It is known that as soon as we decide what to count, then we can talk about the organization of an accounting account.

11:32.000 --> 11:42.000
Will we count cash and cashless money, debt, equipment, material values, unfinished production, and so on?

11:42.000 --> 11:53.000
We will divide all the objects of accounting study into two large groups. We make two new definitions.

11:54.000 --> 12:02.000
One group is called assets, and we will include all the organization's funds and their movements.

12:02.000 --> 12:11.000
The other group is called passives, and we will include the sources of education and use of the organization's funds.

12:11.000 --> 12:29.000
The organization's funds can also be divided into groups such as the main assets, non-material assets, and call them non-return funds.

12:29.000 --> 12:41.000
The main assets are the buildings and structures that are built, and the non-return funds are the funds that are not used.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
Let's see in more detail what will be included in these groups.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
The non-return funds, as I said, are divided into the main assets and non-material assets.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
The main assets include the buildings and structures that belong to the organization,

13:01.000 --> 13:14.000
the work and power equipment, measuring and regulating devices, computing equipment, transport, tools, household inventory, and road infrastructure.

13:14.000 --> 13:24.000
Non-material assets are those that do not have a material form, but also belong to the organization.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
These are patents for inventions, trademarks, and the concept of Goodwill.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
We will discuss this concept in more detail a little later.

13:36.000 --> 13:49.000
The next group of non-return funds is the call funds.

13:49.000 --> 13:58.000
The non-return funds include production reserves, unfinished production, and future periods.

13:58.000 --> 14:13.000
We will define this as a name, and later we will give a more detailed explanation to these non-return funds.

14:13.000 --> 14:25.000
The production reserves are materials, semi-finished products, and blanks for production and trading enterprises.

14:25.000 --> 14:36.000
The call funds are used to account for ready-made products of production enterprises,

14:36.000 --> 14:47.000
the funds in the accounts for the positions of your customers, that is, the product that you have already released but have not yet been paid for,

14:47.000 --> 14:58.000
the money that is in the cash register and on the accounts of the organization, short-term financial investments of the organization, and other turnover assets.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
Another group of funds is the withdrawn funds, which are temporarily or irrevocably withdrawn from the economic turnover.

15:07.000 --> 15:17.000
The paid funds are irrevocably withdrawn from the budget, and the temporarily withdrawn funds are reimbursed taxes.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
There is a tax on the added value of the acquired assets.

15:21.000 --> 15:36.000
You buy the materials and pay the tax on the added value, and then you have the right to pay this tax after the acquisition of the assets.

15:36.000 --> 15:46.000
The payments for the use of the bank's loans will also be counted in the withdrawn funds of the organization.

15:47.000 --> 15:56.000
We have already discussed the assets of the organization.

15:56.000 --> 16:11.000
Let me remind you that these are the main funds, non-material assets, long-term financial investments, unfinished construction, and income investments in material values.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
All of these will be called non-returnable assets.

16:15.000 --> 16:28.000
The non-returnable assets include stocks, raw materials, ready-made products, unfinished production, and short-term financial investments.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that long-term financial investments are included in the group of non-returnable assets,

16:34.000 --> 16:43.000
and short-term financial investments, which the enterprise invests in a group of returnable assets for up to 12 months,

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
also include money and debtors' debts.

16:48.000 --> 16:56.000
Another group of withdrawn assets is the payment to the budget, reimbursable taxes, and payments for the use of the bank's loans.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
We have already discussed the concept of the asset of the organization.

17:01.000 --> 17:21.000
The second part of the balance sheet will consist of passives or sources, which are used to purchase the organization's assets.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
The passives can also be divided into three parts.

17:26.000 --> 17:40.000
The passives are the organization's own funds, the loan funds, and a group of additional funds that will participate in the organization's money circulation.

17:40.000 --> 17:49.000
The original, own funds that any organization receives when it registers are its fixed capital.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
As the organization works, additional capital is formed.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
The organization has the right to create various reserve funds, and gradually reserve capital is formed.

18:02.000 --> 18:12.000
The organization earns profits. All commercial organizations in Russia are created to make profits.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
This unallocated profit is also formed by the organization's own funds.

18:22.000 --> 18:31.000
The loan funds consist of loans and loans, long-term loans, which are received for more than 12 months,

18:31.000 --> 18:39.000
and short-term loans and loans, which must be returned within a year.

18:40.000 --> 18:48.000
Additional funds are salary contributions, which are temporarily in the company's use,

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
the budget for taxes and fees, social insurance contributions,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
and contributions to suppliers and other creditors.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
And the reserve of the upcoming expenses.

19:04.000 --> 19:13.000
We have divided the organization's assets into assets and passives.

19:13.000 --> 19:20.000
Now we have to decide what to measure.

19:20.000 --> 19:28.000
We have to measure the machines that the organization owns,

19:28.000 --> 19:37.000
and measure the collective's labor investments, and calculate the organization's capital.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
There must be a single, universal unit.

19:43.000 --> 19:51.000
The measurers you know can be divided into natural, labor, and monetary.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Natural ones are used to determine the object.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
We can count objects in pieces, in kilograms, in meters.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
We need labor measurers to determine the amount of labor spent.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Whether it is a working day, an hour.

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
Monetary ones are used to reflect all objects in a single expression.

20:15.000 --> 20:26.000
In the Russian Federation, the unit of a monetary expression is rubles, and this is regulated by law.

20:27.000 --> 20:35.000
Natural ones can be divided into a group.

20:35.000 --> 20:46.000
Natural ones are used to reflect the same objects, but with different quantities.

20:46.000 --> 21:01.000
In order for all objects to be measurable, they must have a single expression.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
This is the monetary expression.

21:03.000 --> 21:12.000
The monetary expression of accounting objects ensures the reality of accounting indicators,

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
their compatibility with the organization's economic activity.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
Now I want to give you a small example.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Imagine a fruit store.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
What is in a fruit store?

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
20,000 rubles in cash, 100 kilograms of oranges, and 20 kilograms of apples.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Can you determine the total amount of goods in the store?

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Is this information I am giving you enough?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
No, you cannot.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
You cannot add up the cash register and the apples in the boxes.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
They are expressed in different units of measurement.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
To bring them to a single denominator, to calculate them,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
you need to add the information that oranges cost 50 rubles per kilogram,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
and apples cost 60 rubles per kilogram.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
You can add up the total amount of goods in the store, and you will see that it is 26,200 rubles.

22:14.000 --> 22:22.000
Thus, a single monetary expression makes the elements of accounting information comparable.

22:22.000 --> 22:31.000
Both the turnover of current bonds, the profits of assets, the sources of funds, and the creditor's debt.

22:32.000 --> 22:40.000
What is a balance? How will the real life of an enterprise be reflected in the balance?

22:40.000 --> 22:49.000
How do the assets of an organization, its assets, and the sources of its passive education reflect in the accounting balance?

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
We will see this with you in the examples.

22:55.000 --> 23:03.000
Let's say that an industrial organization has a regular fund of 180,000 rubles.

23:03.000 --> 23:12.000
This fund provides the organization with all the necessary funds for its production activities.

23:12.000 --> 23:20.000
The main funds purchased for this money are 100,000 rubles.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
The organization purchased raw materials and materials from the regular capital fund for 25,000 rubles,

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
purchased fuel for 5,000 rubles, and the bank had 50,000 rubles left.

23:32.000 --> 23:41.000
We will write down the assets in the balance on the left, and the passives on the right.

23:42.000 --> 23:50.000
The total amount of economic assets will be 180,000 rubles.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
The right side will have a passive fund that contains only one position of the regular capital fund,

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
and this amount is also equal to 180,000 rubles.

24:01.000 --> 24:10.000
Our enterprise was created, and it started. How will the facts of economic life be reflected in the balance?

24:10.000 --> 24:18.000
Let's look at the examples. An enterprise acquires raw materials from a counteragent.

24:18.000 --> 24:28.000
What happens to the balance? What economic operations should an accountant carry out?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
How will this be reflected in the balance?

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
The raw materials are acquired, which means that the raw materials reserves have been formed.

24:36.000 --> 24:43.000
The reserves are an active part of the balance. The asset is increasing.

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
The raw materials are acquired, but the enterprise has not yet paid the money.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
This means that the debt to the counteragents appears.

24:54.000 --> 25:04.000
The debt is a passive part of the balance. The asset and the passive balance have increased.

25:04.000 --> 25:19.000
The debt to the counteragents is increased by transferring cash from the account of the organization of the raw materials recipient to the account of the counteragent.

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
How will the accountant be able to reflect this in the balance?

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
What economic operations should he carry out? What will the result be?

25:33.000 --> 25:42.000
If the debt is reduced, the amount of money transferred is reduced.

25:42.000 --> 25:56.000
The debt is reduced, the balance is passive, and the amount of money transferred is reduced.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
The money was paid to the counteragent from the account.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
The account is an active part of the balance.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
The balance is reduced and is in the asset.

26:08.000 --> 26:18.000
As a result of this economic operation, when the debt is reduced by transferring cash from the account of the organization of the counteragent,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
the balance is reduced, both the passive and the asset.

26:23.000 --> 26:32.000
The next economic operation is when the organization of the counteragent unloads the finished product from the warehouse.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
The balance of the finished product is reduced.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
The balance of the stock in the warehouse is reduced.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
The stock and the finished product are active parts of the balance.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
The asset is reduced.

26:46.000 --> 26:54.000
At the same time, the enterprise has not received a payment for the finished product.

26:54.000 --> 27:04.000
The article on the payment of the counteragent for the finished product is increasing.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
This is also an asset of the organization.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
This article is increasing.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
What happened to the asset?

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
When the stock was reduced, the asset was reduced.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
When the debt was increased for the finished product, the asset was increased.

27:21.000 --> 27:33.000
The next economic operation is when the counteragent pays off its debt by transferring cash to the account of the organization of the supplier.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
For example, for the materials.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
The debt of the counteragent was in the asset.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The asset is reduced.

27:44.000 --> 27:53.000
The money received by the counteragent is increased.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
The money is transferred to the bank's account.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
The asset is also increased.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
The last example.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
The organization receives a loan from the bank.

28:07.000 --> 28:18.000
The bank has transferred a loan amount to the account of the organization.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
How will this affect the balance?

28:22.000 --> 28:30.000
If the money is increased, and the money is an active part of the balance, the asset will increase.

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
But the enterprise becomes a debtor of the bank for the amount of the loan.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
The debt to the bank is a passive part of the balance.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
The asset will increase.

28:46.000 --> 29:00.000
The main concept in accounting is that the balance asset must always be equal to its passive part.

29:00.000 --> 29:10.000
The main capital equation in accounting is that the asset is equal to the passive part.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
The passive part is the capital of the organization plus some obligations of the organization.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
This is the main capital equation in accounting.

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
You should remember that the asset is equal to the capital plus obligations.

29:26.000 --> 29:34.000
This equation is used to determine the optimal structure of the organization's passives.

29:34.000 --> 29:47.000
We can say that the economic meaning of the balance is that the acquisition of the organization's assets must be provided by the availability of the relevant sources.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
But you know that nothing is taken from nothing, just like it doesn't disappear.

29:53.000 --> 30:00.000
If there is a source, there is money, the organization's assets or resources can be acquired,

30:00.000 --> 30:07.000
or the organization's materials, or money can be obtained at the organization's account.

30:07.000 --> 30:17.000
The organization's resources can be the funds of the founders and participants, the so-called statutory capital.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
The organization's creditors are obliged to use the assets as sources.

30:24.000 --> 30:31.000
The so-called stable passives are selected from the passives.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
This is the obligation that is legally postponed.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
For example, the debt to the amount of the salary of the organization's employees for the past month,

30:44.000 --> 30:51.000
the tax rate, the term of payment, which is also postponed compared to the end of the month.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
Maybe you know that the salary is always charged on the last day of the month,

30:56.000 --> 31:12.000
for example, in March, March 30, and the payment of the salary according to the collective agreement in the organization is expected on April 5, 8, 10.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
The same way taxes are charged on the last day of the month.

31:17.000 --> 31:27.000
Payment is provided by the Russian legislation, for example, a tax on the added value of the next month on the 20th,

31:27.000 --> 31:38.000
or a tax on the profit on the 28th, the next month of the accounting period.

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
This is the group of obligations that are called stable passives.

31:46.000 --> 31:57.000
What we have seen, several economic operations and their impact on the balance, suggests several conclusions.

31:58.000 --> 32:09.000
The first conclusion is that any change in the capital and obligations of the organization should be accompanied by an increase or decrease in the share of its property.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
That is, the passive changes, the asset changes.

32:14.000 --> 32:22.000
The second conclusion is that when an operation is carried out, as a result of which the currency of the balance does not change,

32:22.000 --> 32:33.000
but only the structure of assets or passives changes, only the structure, that is, the size of passives and assets should not change either.

32:33.000 --> 32:41.000
In a normally operating organization, the size of the obligations of the organization usually corresponds to the amount

32:41.000 --> 32:52.000
that creditors can expect when liquidating an operating entity, with an expectation of meeting their requirements in full.

32:52.000 --> 33:01.000
The size of the capital in a normally operating organization corresponds to the value of the property of the organization,

33:01.000 --> 33:09.000
the value of the property subject to transfer to the founders and participants in the event of liquidation of the organization.

33:09.000 --> 33:22.000
It should be noted that the capital includes not only the statutory capital, the value of the property incurred when creating an organization,

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
but also additional and reserve capital, as well as the amount of unallocated profit.

33:29.000 --> 33:37.000
If the result of the organization's activities in the previous accounting period was negative,

33:37.000 --> 33:46.000
then the amount of the loss received when determining the capital is taken into account with a minus sign,

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
and in the forms of accounting, these amounts will be shown in round brackets.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
Now let's talk about the size of the organization's own capital.

33:58.000 --> 34:13.000
It should be noted that the organization's own capital can be determined based on the balance sheet of the accounting balance.

34:13.000 --> 34:26.000
It can be converted and obtained that the organization's capital is equal to the organization's assets minus its obligations.

34:26.000 --> 34:36.000
This equation is used to determine the value of the assets acquired at the expense of the organization's own funds,

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
and it is called the organization's pure assets.

34:40.000 --> 34:50.000
If the organization does not have a reserve of the upcoming expenses, then the value of the pure assets is equal to the organization's capital.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
That is, our equation for pure assets is as follows.

34:56.000 --> 35:04.000
Pure assets are the organization's assets, reduced to the value of its obligations.

35:05.000 --> 35:13.000
Why do we need to count pure assets? Why do we need to know what they are equal to?

35:13.000 --> 35:20.000
When the size of the pure assets becomes smaller than the size of the declared statutory capital,

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
the Russian legislation should either reduce its statutory capital,

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
or change the organizational legal form, or be eliminated altogether.

35:33.000 --> 35:44.000
Let's see how the change in the organization's assets and passive balance is reflected in practice when performing typical economic operations.

35:44.000 --> 35:53.000
The life of an organization begins with its first entry balance.

35:53.000 --> 36:00.000
For example, let's take an organization whose entry balance looks like this.

36:00.000 --> 36:07.000
The main assets are 25,000 rubles, raw materials are 1,000 rubles,

36:07.000 --> 36:16.000
cash is 2,000 rubles, that is, the total asset, the total organization's assets are 28,000 rubles.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
The passive balance should include the sources that were able to generate these funds.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
In the passive balance, the statutory capital is also worth 28,000 rubles.

36:29.000 --> 36:40.000
The life cycle of the organization begins, economic operations occur.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
Let's start with the following.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
The raw materials are shipped from the warehouse to the production workshops, which are engaged in the production of products.

36:51.000 --> 36:59.000
The workers are engaged in the production of products, they need a salary.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
The workers are paid a salary for processing these materials.

37:05.000 --> 37:13.000
Both the materials and the salary result in production costs for the processing of products.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
But the products have not yet become ready-made products.

37:17.000 --> 37:24.000
We will call these costs unfinished production.

37:24.000 --> 37:33.000
The materials have already been used up, the technological cycle has already passed, and the workers have been paid a salary.

37:33.000 --> 37:40.000
But the finished products have not yet been received, but have received an article called unfinished production.

37:40.000 --> 37:47.000
As soon as the workers are paid a salary, the enterprise is in balance.

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
An article is formed, which is called the enterprise's debt to its workers.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
The debt is the sum of the salaries received.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
We will write it down in short in the balance, the salaries paid to the workers.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Our balance is introductory.

38:04.000 --> 38:11.000
As a result of these two economic events, the enterprise acquires a new look.

38:11.000 --> 38:23.000
The materials are released, the work is spent, the unfinished production is paid, and the employees are paid.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
These articles are highlighted in color.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
The enterprise's life cycle continues.

38:35.000 --> 38:44.000
The next operation is the delivery of the materials, for which the enterprise has not yet paid.

38:44.000 --> 38:52.000
The warehouses have been replenished, but the payment has not yet been made.

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
The bank has received and delivered money to the cash register for the workers' salaries.

38:58.000 --> 39:05.000
The money on the accounts has decreased, and the cash register has replenished the money.

39:05.000 --> 39:12.000
These operations, which have been carried out, are highlighted in color.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
Pay attention to the table.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
You can see the movement in active and passive articles.

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
In addition, you can see that the balance sheet changes.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
The balance sheet of passive and active articles has changed to the same value.

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
This balance sheet is called the currency of the balance.

39:38.000 --> 39:46.000
In other words, the balance sheet of the asset equals the balance sheet of the passive article.

39:47.000 --> 39:55.000
The next operations in the life cycle of the enterprise include the export of the main resources,

39:55.000 --> 40:05.000
the salaries are kept in the tax budget, and the main resources are worn out during production.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
The cost is transferred to the produced product.

40:09.000 --> 40:18.000
The wear of the main resources will reduce the value of the main resources, but the value of the unfinished production will increase.

40:18.000 --> 40:27.000
When taxes are calculated from the salary, a new article appears in the passive article, such as the budget calculations.

40:27.000 --> 40:34.000
Again, pay attention to the table you see on the slide.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
New articles are highlighted in a new color.

40:38.000 --> 40:48.000
As a result of six operations, you can see that six articles of the accounting balance have undergone changes.

40:48.000 --> 40:57.000
The last operation we will consider here is the payment of the salary.

40:57.000 --> 41:05.000
The employees of the enterprise no longer have to pay their salaries in full.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
There is also a little money left in the cash register.

41:10.000 --> 41:23.000
You can also see the articles that have changed over the course of several operations.

41:23.000 --> 41:34.000
As a result, the balance currency at the time of the last operation is 28,017 rubles.

41:34.000 --> 41:44.000
Under the influence of economic operations, there are completely different changes in the balance.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
The asset can increase, the passive can increase.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
When the asset and passive change, the balance currency can change.

41:52.000 --> 42:01.000
We will list all the possible changes in the balance in a table.

42:01.000 --> 42:10.000
We will describe them with the simplest equation, as I promised you, that the entire accounting account consists of operations of addition and subtraction.

42:10.000 --> 42:19.000
In the first article, the asset is a plus-economic operation, a minus-economic operation, but it must still be equal to the passive.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
In the first operation, the balance currency changes do not occur.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
The changes were only in the asset.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.000
One of the asset articles increased and caused changes in another article in the asset.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
There was no movement in the passive.

42:38.000 --> 42:51.000
These are four main operations that can be described as all the changes in the balance of enterprises.

42:51.000 --> 43:00.000
We have already seen how the balance changes under the influence of economic operations.

43:00.000 --> 43:05.000
Now let's look at the balance sections.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
The balance assets contain only two sections.

43:09.000 --> 43:18.000
The first section is called non-returnable assets, and the second section is called returnable assets.

43:18.000 --> 43:27.000
The sum of these two sections is called the balance, or the result is called the balance currency.

43:27.000 --> 43:38.000
The first section includes articles such as non-returnable assets, basic funds, long-term financial investments, and unfinished construction.

43:38.000 --> 43:50.000
The second section, called returnable assets, includes articles such as reserves, debt, and money.

43:50.000 --> 43:59.000
The balance assets include three sections.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
Section number three is the balance assets, which include capital and reserves.

44:04.000 --> 44:11.000
There is share capital, and the additional capital that arises during the organization's activities.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
The reserves created form the reserve capital.

44:14.000 --> 44:22.000
The profits of previous years, the uncovered losses of previous years, the unallocated profits of the report year, and the uncovered losses of the report year.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
All these articles form the capital and reserves section.

44:27.000 --> 44:36.000
The passive section is separately considered for their expiry date.

44:36.000 --> 44:44.000
Long-term bonds, loans, and other passives form the fourth section of the balance.

44:44.000 --> 44:56.000
Short-term bonds, such as loans, credit debt, income of future periods, and reserves of future expenses form the fifth section of the balance.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
We call it the balance, or the balance of profits and losses.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
It seems like this is the only document that can be compiled.

45:05.000 --> 45:15.000
There are many types of balance. Let's try to understand their classification.

45:15.000 --> 45:20.000
You can read more information in the e-book.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
The balance is distinguished by the date of creation.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
The passive balance, the current balance, the unallocated balance, and the liquidation balance.

45:31.000 --> 45:38.000
The passive balance is the first balance that the organization has in its life.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
You have already seen what the passive balance looks like.

45:42.000 --> 45:55.000
It is the capital and property that can be acquired for the organization's funds.

45:55.000 --> 46:09.000
Or the organization will be in debt to the funders.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
The first types of balance are the passive balance.

46:12.000 --> 46:22.000
The current balance is the balance that the enterprise has in its life.

46:22.000 --> 46:34.000
They can be initial, intermediate, quarterly, or monthly.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
And they can be the final balance at the end of the year.

46:39.000 --> 46:45.000
In addition to these two types, there are also liquidated balances.

46:45.000 --> 46:53.000
If the enterprise is on the verge of bankruptcy, but there is a chance to save it,

46:53.000 --> 47:03.000
the liquidated balance is used to see where and in what place the articles need to be corrected.

47:03.000 --> 47:11.000
The liquidation balance is used at the time of liquidation, but there are also several types of balance.

47:11.000 --> 47:21.000
The first balance is at the beginning of liquidation, then the intermediate balance, after some calculations with the creditors,

47:21.000 --> 47:30.000
and the final balance is at the time of liquidation.

47:30.000 --> 47:39.000
The liquidation balance is used at the time of reorganization of the enterprise.

47:39.000 --> 47:49.000
It can be divided into several small enterprises, or some of them can be joined.

47:49.000 --> 48:00.000
In addition to the classification by date of composition, there are also several signs of balance.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
The source of the balance is possible.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
For example, the inventory, book, general balance.

48:08.000 --> 48:15.000
If the balance is made after the inventory, then the balance is the inventory balance.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
The next sign of classification is the volume of information.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
The balance can be single or composite.

48:22.000 --> 48:30.000
For small enterprises that are not part of a group of companies, it is a single balance.

48:30.000 --> 48:39.000
Composite, consolidated balances are made for a group of enterprises or for ministries.

48:39.000 --> 48:46.000
The balance can be based on the main activity or non-main activity.

48:46.000 --> 48:53.000
The main activity of an enterprise is not the main activity of one of its units.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
Let's say, an enterprise has a recreation base on the balance.

48:59.000 --> 49:06.000
You can make a balance based on non-main activity on this recreation base.

49:06.000 --> 49:14.000
The balance can be independent or separate based on the method of cleaning.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
There are no balances.

49:16.000 --> 49:26.000
In Russia, before the perestroika, balances were not cleaned.

49:26.000 --> 49:33.000
There were balances that could be discussed for several hours without stopping.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
What funds are there, how they are moving, what are the profits, what are the losses.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
These were very large balances, up to 200 articles.

49:45.000 --> 49:52.000
It was not easy to work with such balances, to analyze them.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
There are no balances.

49:54.000 --> 50:01.000
In these balances, some articles are to be scrapped.

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
For example, the main funds in the balances are shown by the residual value.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
What does this mean?

50:10.000 --> 50:18.000
This means the balance value of the main fund minus its amortization to the date of the balance.

50:18.000 --> 50:31.000
The balances that contain the balance balance based on the results of some articles are called the balance no.

50:31.000 --> 50:37.000
In Russia, they are now called the balance no.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
They are called the balance balance.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
These are the balances that we will work with, which we will consider,

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
which enterprises use most often in their activities.

50:52.000 --> 51:04.000
The complete set of accounting reports for commercial organizations consists of six forms and an explanatory note.

51:05.000 --> 51:15.000
I said that the most popular forms are the first accounting balance and the second account for profits and losses.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
These are the forms that are of interest to all users of accounting.

51:20.000 --> 51:29.000
In addition, these are two forms that are made up of intermediate accounting, both the final and the intermediate.

51:29.000 --> 51:38.000
It is allowed not to make up the rest of the accounting forms quarterly and monthly.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
These are the forms for annual accounting.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
So, form number one is the accounting balance.

51:46.000 --> 51:53.000
The balance includes and groups the economic funds of the organization in terms of types and placement,

51:53.000 --> 52:02.000
the sources of the formation and the purpose of the organization, and the money meter for a certain date.

52:02.000 --> 52:09.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the accounting balances are made up for a certain date.

52:09.000 --> 52:16.000
Either it is the end of the month, or the end of the quarter, or the end of the year.

52:16.000 --> 52:25.000
You can choose any other date in your organization and make up the intermediate accounting, for example, for April 15.

52:25.000 --> 52:32.000
This is if you need it for analytical purposes.

52:32.000 --> 52:39.000
The criterion of the significance of the balance articles can be determined in percents from the balance currency.

52:40.000 --> 52:47.000
It is static information and gives only a list of assets and passives of the company.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
I would like to explain what is the significance of the balance currency in percents.

52:53.000 --> 53:03.000
Let's say you have money in the organization's cash register at the end of the year, which is only 100 rubles.

53:03.000 --> 53:12.000
And the balance currency is in thousands of rubles, that is, about 30,000 rubles.

53:12.000 --> 53:20.000
Your 100 rubles to 30,000 is a very low share.

53:20.000 --> 53:28.000
Is it worth showing these 100 rubles in the cash register when the total amount of property is much higher?

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
You can simply neglect these articles.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
It makes no sense to show the balance with this article.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Let's say, the money is in the account, if there are more of them.

53:37.000 --> 53:46.000
If there is also zero in the account, then there is no point in showing any figures in this article.

53:46.000 --> 53:53.000
The next accounting form, form number 2, is called the report on profits and losses.

53:53.000 --> 53:59.000
This form characterizes the financial results of the organization's activities during the accounting period

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
and contains data on income, expenses and financial results,

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
in total, the increasing result from the beginning of the year to the accounting date.

54:08.000 --> 54:15.000
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that you make the balance on a certain date,

54:16.000 --> 54:26.000
and the report on profits and losses is made during a certain period from the beginning of the year to the accounting date.

54:26.000 --> 54:32.000
The next form, form number 3, is the report on capital changes.

54:32.000 --> 54:41.000
It is an analysis of the changes in net assets and capitalization of the organization as a result of economic activity.

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
It covers only the operations that directly affect the organization's capital.

54:48.000 --> 54:55.000
The next form, form number 4, is the report on the movement of money.

54:55.000 --> 55:05.000
This report shows the flow of money, their income and expenses as a result of several types of organization activities.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
There are usually three types of organizations' activities.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
They distinguish between the current activity, investment activity and financial activity.

55:15.000 --> 55:21.000
This report is also made during the accounting period, in conjunction with the remains of money,

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
at the beginning and end of the accounting period.

55:24.000 --> 55:31.000
One of the applications for the accounting balance, form number 5, does not have a special name.

55:31.000 --> 55:38.000
This application is intended to provide users of the accounting balance with additional data,

55:38.000 --> 55:44.000
which is a decryption of the main articles of the accounting balance.

55:44.000 --> 55:53.000
The name of this form determines its strong relationship with the articles of the accounting balance,

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
based on their compatibility.

55:56.000 --> 56:05.000
This data is necessary for users to assess the organization's financial and property position.

56:05.000 --> 56:12.000
Another accounting balance form, form number 6, is the report on the use of targeted funds.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
This form is intended for non-commercial organizations in Russia.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
The following data can be taken from this form.

56:21.000 --> 56:29.000
The use of income, membership contributions, voluntary contributions and the amount of other income.

56:29.000 --> 56:35.000
The accounting balance is supplemented by an explanatory note.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
It contains the necessary information about the organization,

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
the disclosure of which is provided by the Russian legislature,

56:43.000 --> 56:50.000
and additional information that clarifies the data of other accounting balance forms.

56:50.000 --> 57:05.000
It is used to clarify the turnover of the enterprise,

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
and the activity of the enterprise's funds.

57:10.000 --> 57:19.000
The accounting balance form is established by the Russian Ministry of Finance.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
After the form is filled, all commercial organizations

57:24.000 --> 57:32.000
submit their accounting balance to the founders of the organization or the owner of the property.

57:32.000 --> 57:39.000
The tax authorities and the statistical authorities submit their accounts to the tax authorities.

57:39.000 --> 57:47.000
The accounting year under the Russian legislation is extended from January 1 to December 31.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
The deadline for submitting the accounts is set.

57:52.000 --> 57:58.000
The Russian Ministry of Finance also sets the deadline.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
As I said, there is an interim report.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
This is a report for a certain period of the organization.

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
It is needed for an immediate response to changes in the financial situation of the organization.

58:14.000 --> 58:23.000
As a rule, an interim report for a quarter is also provided to the external users of the Tax Inspection

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
and some forms in the statistics.

58:28.000 --> 58:34.000
The deadline is the last calendar day of the reporting period.

58:34.000 --> 58:39.000
The reporting period is December 31 for the annual report,

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
and the last day of the month for the interim report.

58:45.000 --> 58:59.000
The publicity of accounting reporting is in the publication of the reporting in newspapers and magazines

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
that are available to users of accounting reporting.

59:03.000 --> 59:12.000
The publication is obligatory, and the accounting balance and the financial results report are subject to the obligation.

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
The publication is not obligatory for all organizations.

59:18.000 --> 59:26.000
The accounting balance and financial results are published by the accounting companies and credit organizations.

59:26.000 --> 59:33.000
No matter how well the accounting balance is done,

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
no matter how well the reporting is done,

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
no matter how well the requirements are met,

59:45.000 --> 59:50.000
the reporting must be done with accuracy.

59:50.000 --> 01:00:00.000
This is due to the fact that the perception of accounting reporting by different users,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
unfortunately, can be different.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Let's look at some cases of paradoxical accounting situations.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
For example, we have an organization.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
It has a small balance.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The organization has the main funds for some amount,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
let's say 2,000 rubles or 2,000 conditional units,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and the goods for 4,000 conditional units,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and the cash in the cash desk and the bank is also 2,000 units.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
The balance has 8,000 units in total.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
The sources that the organization's funds were formed with

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
are the established capital of 5,500,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
the profit for the previous year of 1,500 conditional units,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
and some credit debt that the organization has for 1,000 units.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000
The passive is also equal to the asset and is 8,000 conditional units.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The organization, which has such a balance, is going to make a large purchase,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
to buy a car.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Everything is purchased for money or for the promise to pay them in credit.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
The organization buys a car for 1,900 units.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
In the table, you can see the movement of both cash and main funds

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
that were created in the organization's account, and the money was reduced.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
What is paradoxical in this situation?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Pay attention to the fact that the money that was left on the organization's accounts,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:02.000
100 conditional units, is now not enough to pay off the debts.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
The passive debt is 1,000 units.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:16.000
The profit is there, but the organization is not able to pay off the debts.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The profit is there, but the money is not.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
This is a paradoxical situation.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
The next situation.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:32.000
The organization sells existing goods at a 10% discount.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
The buyers have not received the money yet.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
But the organization must show the profit it has already received.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:51.000
10% of 2,000 goods, 200 units of profit, must be recorded in the balance passive.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
The profit has increased.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Look at the article on cash.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
There is no more money.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
The profit is increasing, but the organization cannot pay off the debts.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The organization continues to produce goods.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But some of these goods are still in incomplete production.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:26.000
All stages of processing have not yet been completed.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
The finished goods are not formed.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
The incomplete production has appeared in the balance asset.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And in the balance passive, the profit has appeared.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You see the increase in profit.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
The profit has increased, but the money has not increased.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
This is not a rare situation.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
My director often asks me the same question.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I see the profit, but can we pay off the dividends?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
We still don't have the money.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.000
The money will appear as soon as they pay for the sold goods.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
The next paradoxical situation.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000
The organization has acquired the right to use software products for five years.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
50 conditional units have been paid for this right.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Since the organization will use these products for five years,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
the expenses will be only one fifth of the total, 10 conditional units.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
40 units of the paid money will be used as a full asset for future periods.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
A new line appears in the asset.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:02.000
The profits will decrease due to the fact that the organization has incurred costs

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
in the form of amortization of the right to use software products.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:21.000
We have spent the money, but the result is not good.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The company's ability to pay has been reduced, and this may lead to bankruptcy.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The next situation.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Real money payments are not made when the company's current expenses are compared to the expenses of future periods.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
For example, the organization has acquired a license for several years,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and every year the cost of the license is partially transferred to expenses.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
The accountant creates a reserve of possible expenses,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
increasing the expenses of the current period and showing the reserve in the passive account for the debitor's debt.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:20.000
For example, a guarantee fund for the repair of its products has been created.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Another situation is when amortization of the main funds or non-material assets is attributed to the company's current expenses.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
In these situations, the company does not make money payments.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Nevertheless, the size of the tax-obtained profit decreases,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
the company's profitability decreases, and as a result, its value paper price drops.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Employees will be deprived of bonuses and other types of monetary incentives.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Although, in reality, the company does not seem to have spent any money.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000
The next paradox is the acquisition of values, but at the moment there has been no payment.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
The asset grows due to the growth of the passive account.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The debtor will be in the passive account.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
In this situation, the company's profit will not change.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Another situation is when the asset increases, but it does not influence the change in the profit.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Some of the values obtained in the order of target financing have become the company's property.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Under the terms of the contract, the company cannot dispose of them at its discretion until the term of the contract is over.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
This situation will not influence the profit.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
These actions have no productive nature.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Values obtained without compensation, for example, in the order of sponsorship, are transferred to the company by the car.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
The car will not increase the company's profit, but it will increase the company's additional capital.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
The next situation is when the company has increased the value of the main assets, and has overestimated them.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The value of the main assets has increased, and as a result, the amortization has increased.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But the amortization of the main assets will in turn reduce the profit of the organization.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Overestimating the increase in the value of the main assets often leads to a reduction in the profit.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
The organization increases the prices of the goods sold.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.000
The sales prices are taken into account, and the value of the property increases.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The profit of the organization will only arise when the goods are sold.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:15.000
The next paradox is the situation in which losses will not arise.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
The company will cancel its creditorial debt.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
The creditorial debt is an active asset.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
The asset will decrease, and the debt will also decrease.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
But this will not lead to losses.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
There is an increase in the balance, but there are no losses.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
The values are transferred in the order of targeted financing.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The company has lost its ownership, but it controls the use of these objects by the recipient.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:59.000
This is not an economic activity, and we are not talking about the profitability of this operation.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
The prices of the goods sold have been reduced.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
As a result, the sales price has decreased.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
There are no losses, but the income of the organization will be somewhat reduced.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
The overestimation of the entire property has been carried out.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Its value has decreased, and the additional capital has decreased.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
This will not affect the profit of the accounting year.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
In the course of the inventory, a shortage has been identified, but the culprits have also been found.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:46.000
In this situation, there is no loss, but if the culprits are not identified, there will be a loss in the organization.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:56.000
To summarize, each of the above reasons leads to the following.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
The connection between the amount of profit and the changing value of the property is broken.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:11.000
The financial result is not what it is shown in the accounting forms.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:20.000
The property will be either overestimated, as it has no property insurance, or it will be difficult to sell it.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Or it will be undervalued, as the property is not reflected in the income.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Let's look at one more situation.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
You can see some of the balance sheet on the slide.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
The company will distribute dividends.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The first economic operation is to pay 500 dividend dividends to shareholders.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
You can see these changes in the balance sheet.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
A new article has appeared, which says that the shareholder will be paid.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
The profit will decrease due to the addition of dividends.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Before their actual payment, this procedure will not change the balance sheet volume, the company's property structure, or the balance currency.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:37.000
After the payment, the shareholder's cash balance has changed.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
The value of the share is reduced by 500.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
The debt in the balance sheet disappears.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the balance currency has changed.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Let's draw conclusions from this economic operation.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000
The value of the profit is not related to the income or loss of the property.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:11.000
It is necessary to study the gap between the growth of the property and the value of the profit, which characterizes the company's successful activity.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Another situation.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:24.000
The same amount can be considered as the income and the loss.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
There are two positions.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:40.000
The situation in the eyes of the owner and the situation in the eyes of the head of the organization, not the owner of the company.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:49.000
The payment of dividends is part of the profit that will be paid to the shareholders.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:57.000
The head of the company considers this procedure as direct expenditure of the company.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.000
The shareholders could invest money in the bank, but they invested it in the shares of the company.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
The head of the company could also go to the bank and take a loan.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Or, in this situation, the shares of the organization were sold.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The owner could either get a percentage of the money in the bank, or he could claim dividends from the shares of the company.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
For the head of the company, this is the situation.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Again, pay interest on the loan, or pay dividends to the shareholders of the shares of the company.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.000
The qualification of the fact of economic activity changes with the change of the point of view.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
It will be either an expense or an income for the owner.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:11.000
The organization can get different financial results with the real asset and its operation.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:24.000
The paradox is that the organization buys three identical objects, three computers.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:32.000
But it buys them at different prices and in different companies.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
All these three computers will have different values for the organization.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:48.000
One computer at a low price can be written off at once for the organization's expenses.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:03.000
The other computer will be used for a year, and the price will allow it to be written off for the organization's expenses.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:17.000
The third computer will be considered important for the organization, and will be put on record as the main asset.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
It will be amortized for several years.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:29.000
The object's value will be transferred to the cost of the produced product and services for several years.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
The key factors in this situation are the price of the product and the importance of this product for the company.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:51.000
The paradox is that one of the three identical computers is used, but it is not taken into account.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It is not listed by the organization.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Another paradox is when the accounting data is not equal to the actual data.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
The company's values can be subject to natural loss.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You know about the loss of a cow, a cowgirl.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Any value is not protected from theft by the company's employees, buyers, and individuals in the state.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000
The real amount of losses can be identified only by inventory.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:40.000
The longer the period of inventory, the longer the company's head stays out of sight.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:52.000
The amortized property can never be presented in a real estimate, because the amount of its loss is always conditional.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:02.000
The accountant can choose the minimum or maximum loss period.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:12.000
The accountant's discretion, the discretion of the financial services, can be used to choose the amortization.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:23.000
The company's money cannot be considered real from the future financial estimates.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
For at least two reasons.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.000
The purchasing power of the money is constantly changing.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:47.000
The foreign exchange rate is constantly fluctuating.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000
The company's account amount is only a bank's debitory debt, in which its account is open.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It is possible that this debt will not be paid off.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000
There is another article on the future period expenses.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:13.000
This is also a missing property, but the account shows this property in the asset.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Future period revenues are the revenues obtained by the property,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:28.000
which are reflected in the profit report, thanks to the exclusive accounting methodology of capitalization of revenues.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:38.000
The company's reserves are also purely conditional quantities of allegedly incurred expenses.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But it is very possible that there were no such expenses.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.000
As I gave you an example, this is the creation of a guarantee fund.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
If the fund is not paid, the expenses will be paid.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
If the fund is not paid, the expenses will not be paid.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:06.000
The funds are already created, and the funds are being calculated.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
The additional capital is only a result of accounting techniques.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000
You need to increase the amount of an asset, but the source of this increase is unknown.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Then the accountants increase the additional capital.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000
When an asset is reduced in the estimate, the additional capital will also be reduced.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Accounting data is not equal to actual data.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
All accounting data are conditional.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Please remember this.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
The degree of conditionality of various accounting data objects is not the same.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:51.000
The significance of accounting data should provide users with the acceptance of effective management decisions.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
The amount of funds of the organization is not equal to their total value.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:06.000
You know that a company can be sold as a property.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.000
At this point, there are two estimates.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
The company has two prices.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
The price of the seller.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
The company has a certain accounting value for the value of its property.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:31.000
The seller estimates the company from the point of view of the actual profitability.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:41.000
The buyer estimates the company from the point of view of the future profitability.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The buyer hopes to get the potential profitability from the management of the company.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
The buyer and the seller's estimates differ.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
The buyer will pay a higher price for the company.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
This difference is called Goodwill.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:10.000
After the transaction, Goodwill will be taken into account as a non-material asset.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:18.000
This allows the company to reflect the investment of the company in the acquisition of third-party enterprises.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.000
The company can show overpayments or underpayments when making these transactions.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Goodwill can be a negative.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The company as a whole can be sold with a loss.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Let's talk about the reliability of accounting data.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:45.000
The company's profit over the course of its existence cannot be determined.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:53.000
In other words, the number of profits is not meaningful.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Why?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:02.000
The purchasing power of the money units changes.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.000
During the operation of the company, the management usually re-evaluates the objects taken into account.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.000
This procedure loses the meaning of the total profit.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:28.000
The change in methods and the norm of amortization of the main assets during accounting also inevitably distorts the total profit.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Methodological methods in accounting lead to fluctuations in the profits of accounting periods and automatically distort the total profit.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Let's try to analyze the balance of the real organization.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Please, open the example of the company's accounting in your textbook.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:05.000
This balance is given for two subsequent periods, the previous year and the previous year.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Let's do a horizontal analysis of the balance sheet.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The following table shows how the balance sheet changes in the asset.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that the balance of the currency has increased by 20.9% compared to the previous year.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:49.000
The turnover of the assets has increased by 162.5%.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.000
The stock of the material and production sectors has increased by 48.2%.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000
The turnover of the assets has increased by 14.3%.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:10.000
This dynamic of balance changes contributes to the growth of the turnover of the assets.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Now let's look at the articles in the passive.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that the short-term debt has increased by 40.9% in the passive.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
The long-term debt has also increased.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:44.000
This change in the debt indicates a change in the structure of the capital and, accordingly, an increase in the financial risk.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:26:03.000
To analyze the structure of the assets, we will refer to the scheme of division into the current and non-current turnover assets.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:12.000
We will refer to the current turnover assets, the debt of the debtors and the reserves of the organization.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:23.000
For example, the increase in the demand for money may be caused by the fast pace of the growth of the share of the debtor's debt in assets,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000
which is often associated with a slowdown in the turnover of the current assets.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:43.000
For a deep analysis, it is advisable to study the aging of the debtor's accounts and the changes in the structure of the reserves.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:52.000
If the changes are negative, it is necessary to pay attention to the management of the assets.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Let's look at the report on profits and losses, but in an unusual form, not in a table form.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:13.000
This is an aggregated form of presenting this report, but in my opinion it has a more clear picture.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:26.000
In the diagrams, you see the blue bars, the first left column is the total revenue received by the organization from the implementation.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
This revenue will be reduced to the production cost of the produced product.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:48.000
The next column is the total revenue of the organization, which will also be reduced to commercial and management costs.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
The next column is the operating profit.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:01.000
The operating profit will also be reduced to expenses unrelated to the main activity.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
We have formed a profit before the tax is withdrawn.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.000
The organization also has loans, which means that interest on loans must be reduced.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:22.000
The organization has received a profit before the tax is withdrawn and other expenses.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:33.000
The organization has paid taxes on profits, and other expenses, such as financial sanctions, have been paid to the organization.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:51.000
The organization has received a net profit, which can be either recapitalized or paid out in dividends, depending on the owners.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I would like to draw your attention to the main sections of the report on revenues and losses.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:12.000
These are the production cost of the produced product, commercial and management costs, and interest on loans.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:29.000
The user who is not very experienced in financial analysis can conduct an express analysis of the accounting report.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:44.000
The goal of the financial analysis is to obtain objective information on the organization's state, identify existing and outlined problems, and draw the organization's leadership's attention to them.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:30:00.000
During the express analysis, changes in the composition of assets, changes in the structure of assets, and changes in the composition and structure of the organization's sources of funds are studied.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Negative trends are identified, for example, the share of the long-term debt that cannot be paid off has increased, or the profit of the organization, which is aimed at increasing its own capital, has decreased.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:32.000
According to the annual report, there are articles that indicate the organization's unsatisfactory performance and poor financial condition.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
For example, loans that were not paid off in time were identified.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000
The VEXs issued by the organization are overdue. The overdue debt and credit debt are due.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:53.000
After the comparative analysis, the balance currency changes are calculated.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:04.000
The calculation is based on the following formula. The balance currency is taken at the end of the year, divided by the balance currency at the beginning of the year, and divided by 100%.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Next, the profit change coefficient is calculated, which is the same as the balance currency change coefficient.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that both the profit and the profit are taken over the current year.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:35.000
The results are compared. The ideal situation for an enterprise is when the growth rate of profit is greater than the growth rate of profit and balance currency.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:43.000
In addition, the growth rate of profit should also be greater than the growth rate of balance currency.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:58.000
In order to analyze the organization's financial activity, an aggregated, simplified balance is made.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:17.000
For this purpose, the formation of assets is carried out. The amount of turnover assets is reduced by the amount of the debit debt for more than 12 months, and the amount of non-turnover assets is increased.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:35.000
The balance assets are formed by the liquidity level. You can find the liquidity classes in your textbook.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:50.000
In the passive, the short-term obligations are excluded from the section of the future periods income and the reserve of the upcoming expenses. In the article, the passive is formed on the term of obligations.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:33:05.000
As a result, the balance has a much more compact look. I would like to draw your attention to the type of accounting equation.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:18.000
The main equation is the following. The asset is equal to the passive. In a new form, it is described through the balance article.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:33.000
The main balance assets, reserves, expenses, cash, short-term financial investments, accounts, debt, and other assets are equal to the passive.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:47.000
The balance assets include sources of property, short-term loans, long-term loans, non-terms of interest, and accounts, debt, and other passives.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:05.000
This is a new type of equation. During the financial state analysis of the enterprise, the debit debt must be analyzed.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Debit debt is a debt for the contract agent, and, accordingly, your lost material benefit.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Debit debt must be kept within 25-27% of the return assets. The lost material benefit can be calculated as the sum of the debit debt multiplied by the number of days of this debt divided by 364 days and multiplied by the refinancing rate of the Central Bank.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:03.000
The accounting equation is usually analyzed in four directions.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Payability is the ability of an organization to pay its debts on time. Sometimes, instead of the term payability, they refer to liquidity or payment, i.e., the ability of certain assets to be sold.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:36:10.000
The liquidity of the balance shows to what extent an organization is able to pay its current short-term debts. This is represented graphically.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:30.000
As an example, I will show a graph of the real-working organization. Current obligations are marked in red, and current assets are marked in blue.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that since 2007, the organization has had problems. It is clear that the organization does not have enough return assets.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:37:04.000
The organization's management spends money on repairs.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:29.000
The company was offered to stop the repairs until the organization regained financial stability.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:44.000
The so-called coverage coefficient is defined as the ratio of return assets to short-term obligations. The recommended value of this coefficient should be at least 2.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:58.000
A higher value can be obtained by accumulating difficult-to-achieve, and sometimes not liquid, stocks of raw materials or unfinished production.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:17.000
If the enterprise seeks to the highest level of liquid returns, it may miss the opportunity to invest this money in projects that could bring good income in the long term.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Another coefficient of liquidity is the quick liquidity, or, as some literature calls it, the refined liquidity. This is a more representative value than the coverage coefficient.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It is calculated as follows. Return assets minus raw materials and short-term obligations. In practice, it is much more difficult to get debts from debitors than to liquidate your stocks.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You need to analyze the nature and quality of the debt, taking into account the term of liquidation, the presence of overdue debt, and the level of dubious debt.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:34.000
The critical level of this coefficient is usually taken as 1. The third coefficient of liquidity is the absolute liquidity. It is calculated according to the formula of high-liquid assets to short-term obligations.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:56.000
The value of this coefficient should be within 0.2-0.3. All three indicators are calculated together. They are convenient for comparing liquidity of a particular organization with data of similar organizations or with average indicators.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Any external user can check and carry out this procedure. The next indicator of the company's financial stability is its profitability.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:30.000
The profitability indicator is used to assess the organization's profitability. It is also called the profit margin indicator. This is the relationship between the organization's net profit and the revenue from the implementation.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:45.000
The profitability indicator of the sales characterizes the most important aspect of the organization's activities – the implementation of the main product, as well as the share of the cost in sales.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:41:00.000
The profitability of all its assets, the profitability of stable sources of total capital, and the profitability of its own capital can also be determined by the similar formula.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:15.000
The next indicator of financial stability is the turnover. The turnover indicator reflects the volume of asset or passive changes in general or specific assets and passives for a certain period.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:35.000
The term turnover implies the decapitalization of assets and the cancellation of passive obligations. The general formula for determining the turnover is the ratio of the turnover per balance article to the average value of the article per period.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:42:00.000
To determine the average value of the article per period, the value of the article per period is taken at the beginning of the period plus the value of the article per period at the end of the period and divided in half.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I have included some types of turnover in the table. You can read it and try to calculate the indicators yourself using the example of the balance sheet.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:35.000
For example, the turnover of the debtor's debt, the turnover of the reserves, the term of the realization or the period of the turnover of the reserves. These formulas can be calculated.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:48.000
One of the key issues in the analysis of the financial situation of an organization is the study of sources of financing and the assessment of financial stability.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Usually, indicators are used to characterize the structure of capital, which reflect the share of the own capital and the debt capital in the total balance.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:22.000
In fact, these indicators are interchangeable. The first indicator is the financial independence. The organization is determined by the formula as the ratio of its own capital to the balance sheet.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:49.000
The second indicator is the debt dependence. The same is true for the debt capital as a result of the passive. It is enough to calculate any of these indicators to understand how financially dependent or independent the organization is.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:44:16.000
To analyze the organization's reporting, you need to get information from external sources related to the study. This can be information from your common counterparts, press, electronic media, for example, about alleged tax violations, etc.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:41.000
You need to get a full accounting report of the organization, including an audit report, if it is provided, and an explanatory note. You need to get other documents related to internal business process regulations, including, for example, the organization's accounting policy

01:44:41.000 --> 01:45:07.000
The accounting report allows you to make weighted management decisions in your company's activity, including the assessment and selection of counterparts, partners in joint activities, as well as management decisions for the adjustment of the company's strategy and business processes
