00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Good afternoon, my name is Natalia Smirnova, I am a consultant of BTEC company, or Business Engineering Technologies.

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
Our company is engaged in operational consulting, that is, we are engaged in the production and process management of many companies, both Russian and foreign.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
It is logical to assume that this is what my today's course will be dedicated to.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Before we start, let's talk about what we will be talking about today.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
First, we will discuss the process management system, what it is.

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
Then we will see how the identification and allocation of business processes is done, on which all the processes are built.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
Then we will see how these business processes are described, because not only do they have to be allocated, but they also need to be described.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Then we will see how we can analyze business processes before we optimize them.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Because, according to experience, 90% of business processes need to be optimized.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Therefore, we describe business processes not to get beautiful pictures, but to do something with these pictures.

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
Next, we will see what methods exist, what methods of business processes optimization exist.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Then we will see about the regulations.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
The regulations in most companies are that no one needs the documentation that is stored somewhere on the shelves and absolutely no one needs it.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
In fact, in the process management system, regulations are necessary that will act, that will be used.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
We will talk about this separately.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Then we will see about the assessment of the cost of business processes.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
What is it?

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
Not only do you need to describe a business process, analyze it, regulate it, but you also need to assess it so that you can manage its cost.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Otherwise, why would you implement a process management system?

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
And in the end, we will see how this business process is built according to the process management system.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I will tell you about an example of how we did it using the example of a number of companies.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Process Management System

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
So, let's move on to the very first point.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
This is a process management system.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Where did it all come from?

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
Surely, you all know that in the early 16th and even earlier centuries there was a simple craft production.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
The craftsman was engaged in all business processes on his own.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
He had no one, or at most there were a couple of assistants.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
There was nothing special.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
And he himself was engaged in both the purchase of materials and the manufacture of leather products, and so on.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
And he developed a strategy for his development, marketing, and so on.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
If, of course, he knew these words.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Therefore, everyone was led by one person.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
We can say that all his crafts were a single business process.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
And he was the only owner.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
What happened over time?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Over time, this happened.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
In 1776, Adam Smith developed the concept of functionality.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
That is, it means that now we have more than one person doing everything.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
And each of us is engaged in what he does best.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
It seems to be a completely logical concept.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
Indeed, why do you, specialists, well, let's say, in logistics, still engage in marketing, strategies, and the description of business processes?

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
And IT, and translations, and phone calls, and coffee trays, and so on.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Absolutely unnecessary.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
That is why Adam Smith proposed the concept of functional division.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
That is, from there, functional-oriented companies were born, which, unfortunately, are now the majority.

03:40.000 --> 03:49.000
This means that each specialist is engaged in his own narrow area of ​​activity, in which he, in which he has no equal.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
For example, there is a specialist like you, in logistics, or finance, or marketing.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
But this does not mean that you are engaged in all marketing.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
You are engaged in some small part of it.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
For example, in cooperation with large clients in the field of PR.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Over time, this has taken on some ugly forms.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Because there were too many narrow specialists.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Everyone was engaged in a very, very narrow part of the activity.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And as a result, no one was responsible for the whole business process.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
That is, as a result, the company began to turn into a group of small specialists,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
each of whom did not know what his neighbor was doing in the room.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
And so, sooner or later, we had to come to the point that we partially returned to the times of craft production.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
What is it?

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
We finally have these small, scattered pieces of functions, and unified processes began to take shape.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
But, unlike the very first time, when all production was considered as a single process,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
now we have processes that are different.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
On the main, on the business processes of management.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
And each of each process has its owner.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Narrow specialists participate in the processes.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Please, nothing changes here for health.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
The most important thing is that there is responsibility,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
and you can ask, what is wrong in the process?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
What is the result? What is the input? What is the output?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
What are the participants? Who is responsible for what?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
And finally, it becomes easier to manage the company.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
Probably because of this, the process management system now has more and more adherents,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
and many, many companies.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
And if before the process management system was the prerogative of only the most advanced Western companies,

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
now the process management is implemented by small and medium companies of the Russian Federation.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
Let's consider the differences between the functional system and the process management system.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
If we take a factory for the production of some products,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
let's say, there are three workers working there.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
If we have a factory built according to the principle of functional division, what happens?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
The first worker only buys.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
He does not care what happens next.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
His task is to buy.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
He buys at the most attractive price,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
from the best suppliers, everything is great.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
He bought everything he needed.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
What to do next is not his problem.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
He does not care. He does not care at all.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
He did his job well, got a salary and went home happily.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
The second worker.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
The second worker gets this material and makes something out of it.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
The second worker does not care whether the consumer needs it or not.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Maybe the consumer has completely different requirements for this product.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
He does not care either.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
His task is to get the material to the warehouse and then to transfer it to the sales manager.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
He is not interested in anything else.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
He did his job from A to B and then his function is over.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
The next worker.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
He took what was made and sells it.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
It is not important to tell the manufacturer that he needs a different product.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
The main thing is to sell it.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
What does it lead to?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
The organization is not inclined to make changes quickly,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
efficiently and smoothly.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
It reacts very slowly to changes in the environment

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
and, in the end, it spends its competitive advantages.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
If this factory worked on the principle of a process control system,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
what would change?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
The first worker.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
He would be responsible for the purchase, production and sale of one product.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Let's say, chairs.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
The second worker would be responsible for the purchase, production and sale of the third product.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Let's say, refrigerators.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
The second product would be computers.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
The second or third worker would be responsible for this.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Thus, each worker is fully responsible for the entire business process.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
The purchase, sale and production of one product.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
What does it lead to?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
The worker is aware of the consumer's requirements.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
He knows the needs of suppliers.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
He knows the features of the company's production.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
He can react quickly, efficiently and smoothly to changes in the environment.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Suppliers may have changed something.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
They began to produce a more suitable material.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Or the consumer may have new requirements for the product.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
This means that the consumer can quickly change the production process,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
purchase or sale of a product.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
The process changes quickly.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Unlike the first case, when everyone is aware of the business process,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
although most of them do not know what the neighbor is doing.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Let's consider the functional approach and the process approach.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Let's compare what is good and what is bad.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Based on what I just said, you may think that the functional approach is not suitable for anyone.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It is a rudiment.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It is not needed by anyone.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It is wrong.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Both approaches have their pros and cons.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
I want to note that the process approach is not suitable for all companies.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Let's look at the pros and cons in more detail.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
If we talk about the functional approach, what are its pros?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
The pros are obvious.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
The first one is less expensive.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
Most likely, you know that a universal specialist who understands many issues

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
is more expensive than a specialist who understands issues from A to B.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
But he understands this issue well.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
Therefore, if there are no such specialists in your company,

09:29.000 --> 09:38.000
the transition to the process approach means a sharp increase in the salary of such new universal specialists.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
As for the pros of the process approach,

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
it is responsible for the overall result.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
If in the case of the first functional option,

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
no one at this factory was responsible for what the factory produces,

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
then in the second case, one manager who was responsible for the purchase, production and sale of a particular product,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
was responsible for the whole process.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
And we could be sure as the managers of such a factory that both the supplier and the consumer are satisfied.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And if they are not satisfied, then the manager will fix everything.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
The pros are flexibility, speed, efficiency of decision-making.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
As for the cons, there is no place without them.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Everything cannot be wonderful and chocolate.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
The functional approach.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
What are the cons?

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
The cons are opposite to the pros of the process approach.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
If the process approach is flexible, then the functional approach is not flexible.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
This is the lack of speed in decision-making on the change of the process.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
This is the lack of responsibility for the overall result of the process.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
This is the lack of efficiency of the whole process.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Yes, your divisions can work perfectly.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
The buyer buys everything quickly.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
The manufacturer produces everything very quickly.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
The seller sells everything quickly and you don't have anything in the warehouse for a long time.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
But for some reason your suppliers are not optimal over time,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
with higher prices than on the market.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And your customers refuse you for some reason,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
because you need to sell differently.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Further.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
The functional approach cannot be without problems at the junction between divisions.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
If you have a lot of specialists involved in the process,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
who understand their narrow problems,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
then the transition from one specialist to another,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
each work in the business process leads to problems.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
One transition is one problem, another transition is another problem,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
more and more.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
The more specialists in your network,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
who are involved in your business process,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
the more problems there will be.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And be sure that it will be very difficult to change such a process.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
It is easier to do it from scratch.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
And finally, this leads to conflicts between divisions,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
or between specialists, people, groups, and so on.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
The disadvantages of the process approach.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
He also has disadvantages.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
He is not perfect.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
First, he is more expensive.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And there is duplication of work.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Let's go back to the example of the factory.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
In the first case, one manager was engaged in the purchase.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
In the second case, the manager was engaged in the purchase and production of sales.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
The second manager was engaged in the purchase and production of sales.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
The third manager was engaged in the purchase and production of sales.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
And so on.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
In fact, the purchase was done by three people.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
This is duplication.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
This is a complication.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
But let's remember the advantages.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
It is the responsibility for the result.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
It is a better product.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Further.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
Let's say that we have a few such managers in our company.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
And we need a person in each of the processes who will help.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
From the point of view of marketing, for example.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
But such a specialist is the only one.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
How to break him between three processes?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Let's say that we have three managers.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Responsible for the chair, for the computer, and for something else.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
But we have only one marketing specialist.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Which business process should you include?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
This is unknown.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
This is a conflict of resources.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
This is not clear.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
This is also a minus of the process approach.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
Especially if you have very few narrowly specialized workers.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
Accordingly, if we have few specialists in our company, who understand everything.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Then we have a conflict of resources.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
And we can not equally divide them into different business processes.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
You have to sit with the same specialist in this process, and in this, and in this, and in this.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
That is, a conflict of resources.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
And the third drawback of the process approach is that we have high requirements for specialists.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
In a company where a process approach is implemented,

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
one person can not sit alone to hand over a piece of paper from department A to department B.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
That's it.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
This means that the specialist must perform the maximum functions.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Otherwise, why do you need such a narrowly specialized person in the company?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Not in all organizations this is possible.

14:09.000 --> 14:17.000
Therefore, if in your company you have a lot of specialists, who do some very small, small, small work.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
This means that the process approach is temporary for you.

14:22.000 --> 14:31.000
Until there are more, more universal specialists, who understand a large number of functions and work.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
Now we have come to the most important point, which in our course will probably be without it.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It makes no sense to continue.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
This is the difference between a business process and a function.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Now we talked about the process approach and the functional approach.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
I think you already roughly understand the difference between a process and a function.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
If you formulated the definition of a business process in your own way, how do you think, how would you formulate it?

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, probably you would say that this is a connection of several works or functions,

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
which are designed to transform something at the input into something that will be at the output.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Otherwise, any process happens.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
A business process is not an exception.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
And it is very important here that there is something at the input and something at the output.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
And to the fact that at the output and to the fact that at the input certain requirements are presented.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
If the process has no result, then it is not a business process, it is not clear what.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
If we talk about a function, then it is a component of a business process.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
This is a certain work, repetitive, which can be included in several business processes.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
But the main thing is just a repetitive periodic action.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
There is no emphasis on the fact that it is designed to transform something at the input into something at the output.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
That is why if we compare a business process and a function,

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
then we can give the following characteristics to a function and a business process.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Let's start with a function as a component of a business process.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
A function is a set of homogeneous activities.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Homogeneous means that they are identical, similar.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
For example, a purchase.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
In general, this is a function.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
Next, this is a set of narrowly specialized activities.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
For example, PR, cooperation with the media.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
These are all functions that are included in a business process marketing.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
And then, the most important, I emphasize again,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
that a function is a component of a business process.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
A brick from which a whole wall is made.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
If we move on to a business process, then it is a set of various types of activities.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
We remember that in the example of a factory we talked about a business process,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
which is called from purchase to sale.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
That is, there are functions of purchase, sale and production.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
If we talk about a business process,

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
we also take into account that business processes are interconnected.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
That is, they are not separate functions that exist in nature and in your company.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
They are connected to each other.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
The entrance of one business process is the exit of another business process, and so on.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
If the process is not connected to anything, it is not needed.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Or this is a sign of inoptimism, it needs to be tied to something.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
This is the presence of entrances and exits.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
A business process is another important feature of it.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
We remember that a business process is designed to transform something into something.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
If the transformation does not take place, then it is not a business process.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Next, the presence of results.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And if there is no result, and this is some kind of partiality,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
or it is not clear what, then this is an improvement.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
A business process is either wrongly allocated, or it functions incorrectly.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
That is, something needs to be done with it.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
And most importantly, it consists of functions.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Thus, we have compared a function and a business process.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And now, when we talk about a business process,

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
we mean the whole function, which is designed to transform an input into a result.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
And now the most interesting thing.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
How does the process management system in an organization work?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
What do you think it starts with?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
For example, someone will tell you that you need to describe a process,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
or you need to allocate processes,

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
or you need to quickly follow the structure of the company and start allocating something from it.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
I do not want to upset you, but both answers will be wrong.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Because you need to start with the most important thing, with the strategy of the company's development.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
Without understanding where your company is going, you will not be able to allocate business processes,

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
because you will not be able to understand which business directions are key to your activities.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
And this means that you will not be able to allocate processes to the main and providing ones.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
If you do not know the strategy of the company's development,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
you will not be able to analyze business processes,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
which are important, which are less important,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
which are problematic, which are less problematic, and so on.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
If you do not know the strategy of your company,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
you will not know the needs of your clients,

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
and you will not be able to form the right requirements for the result of all your business processes.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Without the strategy, it is not possible to implement the process management system.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
The strategy is not a piece of paper that is taken from the company,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
and then it is not shown to anyone,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
and it is put on the shelves along with the regulations.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
The strategy is a real concept that everyone in the organization knows.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
One way or another, but they should know it.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
When there is a strategy, we can safely move on to allocating business processes.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
The first point is that we have developed a strategy of the company

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
and brought it to each unit, to each employee.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
The balance score card is used for this,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
that is, the BSC system.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
I think you will be told about it in another course.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Next, when we already have a strategy,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
we allocate business processes to the company,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
then we describe them, go further, look at the processes,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
and describe it all again to each employee.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Now, when we have described it all,

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
we analyze it all according to the strategy that we have developed before.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
And then, when we have described it all, analyzed it, optimized it,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
we have regulated the processes that have already been optimized,

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
and after that, we will have specific positions in the organization.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
After everything is optimized,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
we will be able to develop our ideal organization.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
In most companies, the organization is created almost from the beginning,

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
without understanding the basic and providing business processes.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Therefore, it is often not optimal,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
it does not collide with the processes.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
In the process management system, the process is the primary,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
and not the structure.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
In the functional approach, everything is vice versa.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
The structure is more important, and the processes are not so important.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
Let's consider, for example, some companies,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
let's call them Evrica,

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
how the organizational structure of the company can look like,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
where the process approach is implemented,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
and where the functional approach is implemented.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Let's say we have a company,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
it is engaged in the purchase of tea, clothes, and furniture.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Well, an absurd example, but nevertheless.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
If we implement a functional approach there,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
we will have a department of purchase,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
a department of storage, and a department of sale.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
It does not matter that it deals with three absolutely incompatible types of activities,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
tea, clothes, and furniture.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It does not matter at all, there will be three departments.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
If the process approach was implemented in this company,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
its organizational structure would be completely different.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
There would be a department of tea, clothes, and furniture.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Thus, we understand that in the second case,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
in the department of tea, there would be departments of purchase,

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
tea, storage, tea, and sale of tea.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
The same would apply to furniture and clothes.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
In the case of a functional approach in the company,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
in the department of purchases,

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
there would be managers of tea, clothes, and furniture.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Storage, sales, everything is the same.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
I want to say right away that I have never seen a company

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
where the process approach was implemented to such an extent.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
In principle, this is not always necessary,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
because the creative organizational structure,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
which has existed for many years and is not always absolutely harmful,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
does not make sense.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
You can make an intermediate compromise option,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
which is called the matrix.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Let's say, in the case of the same company,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
the matrix option would look like this,

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
that it would have at the same time a department of purchases, storage, and sales,

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
but there would also be a manager of tea, furniture, and clothes.

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
In principle, this would allow each manager to examine the entire business process

22:56.000 --> 23:03.000
and to see its problems, inputs, outputs, results, satisfaction of customers,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
interaction with suppliers, and so on, to observe all participants.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
But this would lead to a very serious minus.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
This main minus is that all participants in the business process

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
of tea, furniture, and clothes would be two bosses.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
The first is the head of the department of purchases,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and the second is the project manager.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
If their wishes were conflicted,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
then the performer would not know whom to submit to.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
The principle of double submission is the main minus of such a compromise option.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Therefore, if you do not have a compromise option,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
then you will have to decide what the structure will be,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
whether it will be a process or a matrix one,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
or maybe you will choose a functional one.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
So, we have already talked a lot about business processes,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
that everything is great,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
but do business processes really exist?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Our clients often ask us questions.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
You have described all these business processes,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
but it seems to us that they do not exist.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
They exist, but in fact, they are very fragmented.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
As I said, the fact is that in most companies there is a functional approach,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
so it is very difficult to collect a bunch of small functions,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
narrow-specialized functions,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
and it is also very difficult to see it as a whole.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
Secondly, they are not formalized and not described.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
In fact, in most companies we worked with,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
how is the business process described?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It's an amazing spectacle.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Separately, there is some instruction from some manager for some reason,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
separately, there is an instruction from some department,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
separately, there is a position of the departments.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
They do not clash with each other in principle,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
or they are absolute copies,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
only the cap is different.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
This is not a description of business processes,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
it is just a list of functions that came to the head of the person who wrote it,

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
when he was given this task, and he was told that this task should have been done yesterday.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Next.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Business processes exist.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
They cannot be not exist,

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
because otherwise the company would have collapsed.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
But in most companies,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
even taking into account the fact that they exist,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
no one is responsible for the result.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
Or it happens only in a number of business processes, not in all.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Therefore, if no one is responsible for the result,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
no one sees the situation as a whole,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
again, the business process is not visible to anyone at all,

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
and it can be considered that it does not exist.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Next.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
Very often business processes are very fragmented.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
That is, many specialists participate in this business process,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
no one knows what it is all about.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
Therefore, they can be considered to be part of something,

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
of one big company,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
but it is not clear what their activity leads to.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Very often there is additional control in organizations for each transfer.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
That is, if one manager transfers the result of his work to another manager,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
then to the third, fourth, fifth,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
there is a conflict at every crossroads,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
there is a check, a checkpoint,

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
and this control leads to the fact that all the connection with what should be at the output is lost.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
It is not clear at all, but everything is controlled.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
And most importantly, very often there is no relevant IT support

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
to describe and optimize business processes.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
Believe me, describing business processes in RDA is not the most wonderful thing.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
So, if you, as a manager of an organization,

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
decided that your organization should have a process management system,

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
how to build it step by step?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Step number one.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Select business processes.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Until we talk about their description,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
until we just select them.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
That is, the main business processes that provide business management processes.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Great.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
There should be about 20 of them, no more.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Next.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
We describe them.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
We describe only the boundaries,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
that is, at the input and at the output.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
In order to make sure that we have selected them correctly,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
each business process has its own clear and definite result.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Maybe at this stage we will correct the selection.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Next.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
We describe them.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Namely, the composition of the functions that each of them includes.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
And we describe the executors for each and every function.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Next.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
When we have described all of this,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
we assign the owners for each business process.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
For the first process, for the second, for the third, for the fourth, for the fifth.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And when we have highlighted all of this,

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
finally, we can regulate this business process,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
create a system of accounting for the business process,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
and put it all on the owners of this business process,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
who will observe this system

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
and regularly report to their boss about how things are going in their business process.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Usually, there are many business process reports.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
They are different in each organization.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
In principle, there is a plan-fact report on indicators for each project, that is, KPI.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
It can be a card of some contract,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
if we take the business process at the lowest level.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
In principle, the accounting system can be any.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
It can be in Wardia, it can be in Excel,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
it can be in your corporate information system.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
The main thing is that it is there,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
otherwise no one will need the business process description.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
And all this accounting system for business processes

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
must be combined with your operating accounting system and management accounting system.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
That is, all these accounting systems must be bound together.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Otherwise, you have one accounting system for processes,

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
management accounting is another, financial accounting is something else,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
operational accounting is generally something else,

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
strategic accounting is nothing at all.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Everything should be a single accounting system.

28:51.000 --> 29:01.000
Accordingly, what can you implement the business process management system in your company for?

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
The answer to this question you must ask yourself, your management,

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
before you dive into the process approach of your company.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
Because, as with absolutely any innovation, you need to set a goal.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Why are you doing this?

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
The answer like, it's fashionable, everyone does it, I think it will help us, is not accepted.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
It should be a real, justified answer.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
For example, you need to increase the controllability and transparency of your company, of your business.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Or you need to optimize business processes, you have too high costs.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Or you need to build an effective infrastructure,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
because you have a high flow of personnel,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
changes are happening very slowly, it is not clear what is happening.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
Or you have some new business direction,

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
you need to understand how it will deal with the already existing,

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
what processes will change and how to implement it correctly.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
Or you want to publish business, for example, to introduce a franchise.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
Or you want to introduce an automated accounting system.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
Or you want to conduct, for example, audit of personnel and select completely new frames,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
because the current ones will not suit you.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Or it is a financial accounting, or it is a merger and absorption,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
it can be an increase in market value, in general, it can be anything.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
But the main thing is that the goal is clearly described and understood by everyone.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
Because without a goal, it is not clear why you are doing this.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
Without a goal, you will not be motivated to implement this system,

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
so that it is not from under the stick.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
If your boss told you that we are introducing a process system,

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
do not be afraid, come to him, ask why, let him tell you,

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
let him hold a single seminar on business processes of your company.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
For example, in a company where I once worked as an internal business analyst,

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
its director, the owner, decided that we would introduce a process management system.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
What did it lead to?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I came, I was told that everyone was already aware,

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
everyone would participate in the description of business processes and their optimization.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
I believed, and began to go, respectively, to people, to ask.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Are business processes high-level? We'll talk about it a little later.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Or are business processes of lower level?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Described in what environment? And so on and so forth.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
But no one could answer all my questions, because they did not understand what it was about.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
As a result, it turned out that someone had heard about it.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
But in fact, no one could imagine what it was, why it was necessary.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
As a result, we held a general seminar for the heads of departments,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
where it was told what a process management system is,

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
why it is introduced in a company, what are its pros and cons,

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
what will be introduced in this particular company, where we will work,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
how it will happen, who is responsible, and so on.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
After this seminar, everything was very clear.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
And after this seminar, managers immediately began to come to us in the business processes department

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
and say, I want to participate, I would like to optimize this process,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I have such and such wishes for it.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
Without such an introductory seminar, everyone was tuned to some one wave.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
It is impossible to introduce a process management system.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
So, how does the system function?

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
First, we develop a process model of your company as it is.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
This is very important.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
That is, you do not need to immediately describe and generate options on the topic of how you want it to work.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
First, we describe the situation as it is.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Without having an idea of ​​what we have today,

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
we will not be able to understand all the cons, all the interactions,

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
and we will not be able to analyze and develop a high-quality system of process management of the organization.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
So, first, the model as it is.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Then, the analysis of the model as it is.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Then, the development of the model as it should be.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Then, the development of the regulations as it should be.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And only then, the optimization of the organizational structure.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Only in such a sequence.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
So, what's next?

32:57.000 --> 33:05.000
If we talk about how we analyze business processes as it is,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
analyze our model as it is,

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
then we must refer to the following tools.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
We look at the strategy document of your organization.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
We look at the strategic maps of your company.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
We look at the accounting maps of your company.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
That is, this must be taken into account.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
And we look at the marketing results of the external environment.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
These additional tools will help us analyze the situation as it is.

33:41.000 --> 33:51.000
Now, let's move on to the most important point.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
Now we will talk about the identification of business processes.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
So, where does it all start?

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
We start with the allocation of business processes of the very highest level.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
In other words, we roughly divide the activities of your company into several main blocks.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
There will be about 20 of them.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
There will be 30, 40, 50.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Cut it out.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
This means that you have highlighted too much detail.

34:19.000 --> 34:27.000
Second, we divide your organizational structure as it is now into departments, groups, units, etc.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
While we describe everything as it is.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
That is, we describe the business processes at the top level as it is,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
the organizational structure as it is, and then the distribution of responsibilities as it is.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
This is all as it is.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
How are business processes of the top level identified?

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
So, we are now recalling what your organization was created for.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
What are the main business directions of its activities?

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
Based on these business directions, we can identify what are the main business processes of your business.

34:57.000 --> 35:04.000
For example, your company was created to develop marketing concepts of other companies.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
For example, you are a consulting agency for the development of marketing strategies.

35:08.000 --> 35:16.000
This means that you can have business directions for the development of marketing concepts for small companies, for large companies, and, for example, for medium-sized companies.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Because, in principle, these are different things.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.000
Or, if you are a dairy factory, then you can have business directions for dairy and dairy products.

35:26.000 --> 35:33.000
If you are a clothing agency, then it can be business directions for leather and fur, for example.

35:33.000 --> 35:41.000
That is, when we identify business processes at the top level, we start with business directions of your activities.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
So, we have identified it.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
The most basic.

35:44.000 --> 35:51.000
I want to say right away that you do not need to confuse what is called business direction and business options.

35:52.000 --> 36:01.000
That is, you do not need to select business directions from the series of products for jackets, leather, fur, and, for example, boots.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
This means that you have selected business directions incorrectly.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
You should have a single criterion for selecting business directions.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
This is A.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Either the material, that is, leather or fur.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Or it will be the type of product, clothes or shoes.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Or it will be according to the consumer, physical or legal.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That is, you do not need to mix everything into one pile.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
You select business directions according to some criteria.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
Then you can further divide, for example, leather products into clothes, shoes, and so on.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
We have selected business directions for your activities.

36:33.000 --> 36:42.000
For example, you are a company that deals with the construction and technological support of these built objects.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Well, for example.

36:44.000 --> 36:57.000
Let's say that we have now determined that your main business processes will be related to construction and technological support.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
All other business processes are our providers.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
They have nothing to do with the main business process.

37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
To what level do you need to describe business directions?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
In principle, it can be at this level.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
For example, construction and technology.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
You can go down to a lower level.

37:16.000 --> 37:28.000
For example, construction of shopping centers, car centers, warehouse facilities, and so on.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Technological support of these three objects.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.000
The criteria for decomposition, that is, the criteria for how detailed you will describe your business direction,

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
depend on the fact that you yourself understand and are comfortable using these criteria.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
You do not need to break it down into very small details.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
You select the most important thing.

37:49.000 --> 37:56.000
Because business direction is what you will use to select the main business processes.

37:57.000 --> 38:06.000
Now we can determine for ourselves that the business direction of the upper level corresponds to the main business processes of the upper level.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Construction, technology.

38:09.000 --> 38:18.000
The next level is construction of shopping centers, car centers, warehouse facilities.

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
These are three business processes related to the large business process of construction.

38:24.000 --> 38:31.000
And technological support of shopping centers, car centers, and warehouse facilities.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
These are three business processes that will belong to the large business process of the upper level,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
which is called technological support or technology.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
Now that we have described the business processes of the upper level, we can move on to the main ones.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
After all, your organization is not only engaged in construction and technology.

38:53.000 --> 39:00.000
You also have accounting, marketing, strategy development, personnel department, and so on.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
This means that you have many other business processes.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
We also divide them into large blocks.

39:07.000 --> 39:16.000
In our case, this can be management of personnel, management of marketing, management of strategy, management of finance,

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
economic support, legal support, and so on.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
In other words, we allocate blocks.

39:23.000 --> 39:30.000
When we have allocated all the blocks, we turn to your organizational structure as it is.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
And we look at who is responsible for which department or unit or department for each of the blocks.

39:35.000 --> 39:40.000
For example, for construction, you are responsible for the construction department, for technology, for the technology department,

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
for financial management, you have two departments, accounting and finance.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
For management of personnel, management of personnel, and so on.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
For strategy, for example, the general director, the development council, and someone else.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
All this was described as it is.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
Then we do not adjust the business processes to the organizational structure.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
If you have several participants, write that there are several of them.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
But the main thing is to put the responsible one.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
If there is no responsible one, put the general director.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
In other words, now we have allocated the business processes of the highest level.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
We can make a kind of a table.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
For example, write down all the business processes that we have allocated,

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
write all the names of the units of the highest level that you have in your company.

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
And at the junction in the cells you can write which unit is responsible,

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
which unit is a participant of a particular business process.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
For example, we have a business process of construction.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
We will put the responsible one opposite, at the intersection of the business process of construction and the construction department.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
The same goes for technology.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
Intersection of the technology department and the business process of technology.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Strategy.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
For example, you do not know who is responsible for the strategy,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
and no one in the company can answer you.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
This means that the general director is responsible.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
If no one in the company is responsible for anything,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
the general director is responsible for all this.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Or the company manager.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
But this position is called differently.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Then, when you get such a big table,

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
where all the business processes of the highest level are written down by participants and responsible,

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
you can proceed to the second stage, which is called analysis and optimization of business processes.

41:25.000 --> 41:32.000
But first I want to dwell on a more detailed description of what the main business processes are

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
and what types of business processes can be identified.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
I have already said that there are main business processes.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I think that the name is already clear.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
What are these processes?

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
These are processes that are related to the main activity of your company.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
If you have doubts about which business processes to refer to,

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
forget that you are a manager of a company,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
forget about your position, forget about all this.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
And imagine that only one person represents your company.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
What work will he do first of all?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
So that the company continues to exist.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
This is the work that will come to your mind first,

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
and will be your main business process.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Or your non-main business processes, if there are several of them.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Accordingly, business processes are basic.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
What are their characteristics?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
First, they create an added value for your company.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
No other, only these.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
They create a product or service or work that your company provides on the market.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
You must be a specialist in these processes.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
This is your key competence.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
If you were not sure about this, you would not have them.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Next, these are business processes that represent the value for your external client.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
Externally, that is, not any unit within your company,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
but for an external client.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
If this value exists, then this is the main business process.

42:56.000 --> 43:02.000
Next, these are business processes for which the client is ready to pay you money.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
And finally, another important characteristic.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
These business processes are what bring profit to your organization.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
Yes, the providing business processes can also bring you profit.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
For example, you sold a completely unnecessary computer,

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
or sold a completely unnecessary furniture, and so on.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
This brought you a certain profit.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
But there must be a certain constant profit.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
And this constant profit is formed by the main business processes.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
What about the providing business processes?

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
Providing business processes help the main business processes to live and develop.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
They provide them with the necessary resources.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
They create an atmosphere, external conditions,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
so that they can function freely and normally,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
and bring profit to the company.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Can the providing business processes become the main business processes?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Of course, it can.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
But what if your company is re-profiled,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
and the legal process is not provided?

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
What if you want to outsource it,

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
and create a separate legal consulting department?

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
Plus, you can build technologies.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
Legal consulting in the field of construction is very relevant.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
And this will become the main business process.

44:29.000 --> 44:34.000
There are two more types of business processes in many types of business processes description.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
These are management processes and development processes.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
In most cases, it is enough to highlight the main business processes,

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
and the providing or auxiliary business processes, as they are also called.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
But if you want to list the management or management business processes separately,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
here are their characteristics.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
First, they provide a long-term development of the organization.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
They provide control and management of your company's activities

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
for all the main business processes.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
In principle, they provide,

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
but they also have control.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Therefore, they can be distinguished separately.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
They usually have a standard scheme.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
They look about the same,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
and then they make a plan,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
then they execute it,

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
then they make a plan-fact ratio,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
then they make some adjustments,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
and then they execute it.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Examples of such processes are strategy, marketing.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
If you have a well-developed staff department,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
it can be management of staff.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
Not only sets and registration of salaries are carried out,

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
but also development, training, coaching, and so on.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
It can be a business process of financial management,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
if it is developed in your company.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
It can be a business process of management accounting.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
It can be a business process of IT management,

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
if you have a complex IT system in your company.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
There are a lot of them.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
If you want, you can not list them as business processes.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
You can attach them to the providing.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Another beast is business development processes.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
These are business processes,

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
which are separate projects of your company's development.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
For example, you have decided to implement ERP system.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
The process that will provide this implementation

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
will be a business process of development.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
They can be compared to projects,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
which are introduced into your company,

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
and they have a characteristic,

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
they contribute to the long-term development of your company,

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
but they are not constant.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
They can change.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
They can depend on the external environment

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
and constantly change in the composition.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
For example, the business process of ERP implementation

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
can become a business process of CRM implementation next year.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Then there will be a separate additional system.

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
Maybe, the business process of optimizing personnel's frequency

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
will be transformed into a business process of optimizing personnel's training system.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
This is a business process,

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
which allows you to quickly switch from the current state to the right one.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
Now, when we have highlighted the main business processes of management,

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
we can look at a specific example.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
You may ask, how can we look at an example of such business processes?

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
Here we have a company,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
a real company,

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
where we participated in the project of ERP implementation.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
We have highlighted three types of business processes in this company.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
The main business processes,

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
the supporting business processes,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
and the management business processes.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
The business processes can be divided into

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
retail video production,

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
wholesale video production,

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
and video production and sales.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
As for the supporting business processes,

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
they were classified as security,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
economic and legal.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
As for the management business processes,

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
they were classified as strategic management,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
financial management,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
personnel, marketing,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
and stock management.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
In fact, there is no typical list of business processes in the company.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
You need to look at each company separately.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
And at your company as well.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
This is an example of a tree of business processes,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
that is, a list of business processes,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
which is suitable for a specific organization.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
You can focus on it, but you don't need to copy it.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
Now, if we consider your company,

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
you can also write down the main business processes,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
which your company has,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
and compare them with the supporting and management processes.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
Then you can show them to your company's managers.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
You can start voting,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
show them to your management.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
And from these steps you can start doing something.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
How to correctly identify the business processes of the highest level?

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
It's very simple.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Just remember the four basic rules.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
First.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
We remember what a business process is.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
It is a list of functions,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
a sequence of functions,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
which is assigned something at the beginning,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
and then transformed into something at the end.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
If the business process you have identified

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
has something at the beginning,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
has a specific result,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
then you can assign it to the business processes.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
If not, then you don't need to.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
This does not apply to the business process.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
It can be a part of it, or it can be a function in general.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Next.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Business processes must be equal to the great ones.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
If you assign a business process to the highest level,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
then you should not have an option

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
to assign a strategic support,

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
and next to it there is a process of management

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
of the application for the supply of goods to the supplier.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
These are completely different business processes,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
and this should not be allowed.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Third.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
The degree of detail of the processes must be observed.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
In other words,

50:13.000 --> 50:22.000
you should not assign your business process to 50, 100 or 120.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
You should not do this.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
There are not so many business processes of the highest level.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Remember that the business process of the highest level

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
is a block of your company's activity.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
50 blocks?

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
It is impossible.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
There are about 20 of them,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
check if there are many more.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
This means that something can be combined with something.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
You have gone too deep.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
And finally, the last rule, which you should remember.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
This is, as I said, a coordination.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
You cannot just as a manager

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
assign business processes

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
and then go and describe them.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
You should show them to the people

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
responsible for the business processes,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
coordinate with them,

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
agree or disagree that they participate or are responsible,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
show them to the management,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
agree or disagree,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
hold a seminar

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
where you can state your vision and concept

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
of the business process of the highest level.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
This should suit absolutely everyone.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
Otherwise, it will be just your thoughts on this topic,

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
but in fact, it will not clash with the real picture

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
for your company, for your enterprise.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
As I said,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
we would use

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
some other system of business process description,

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
if we did not focus on the main business processes

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
of management and development,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
we could use other models

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
used by other companies.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
In your concept,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
you can see

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
that there are other ways of description.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
For example, the BAN model,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
the Oracle model,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
the 13-process model,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
the Share model, etc.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
But in fact,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
they all refer to the fact

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
that the business processes

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
can be added by other processes.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
The main thing is to break these two types of activities.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Now let's move on to how business processes are described.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
There are two options

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
for describing business processes.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
The first one is vertical and the second one is horizontal.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Vertical is when you just write

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
that some work consists of such and such work, etc.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
You do not write what is at the entrance,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
what is at the exit, etc.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
If you take a business process of the highest level

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
and then describe which processes are included in it,

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
then which functions are included in each process, etc.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You just write the structure,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
but you do not write,

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
you do not specify any documents,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
any products that are included,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
anything that is not included.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
In the second case,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
horizontal description is more detailed description,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
when you write what is at the entrance,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
what is at the exit of each business process.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
This is more complicated,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
and in the description it takes more time

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
both physically and then for the agreement.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
You can see more details

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
in the slide Vertical and Horizontal Description of Activity.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Now let's see

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
how you can describe business processes.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
They can be described in different ways.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
The first option is text.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
This is what you are all used to.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
This is a regular regulation.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
For example, a department moves a document somewhere.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Table.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
This is when you see a table,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
you write what is at the entrance,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
what is at the exit of the business process,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
who is responsible,

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
to whom it is transmitted,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
what is obtained from whom.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
This is a scheme.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Now I will show how it looks in detail.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
In practice, I want to say that

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
the easiest way to describe business processes

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
is a graphical way of writing.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Because it is clear.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
A lot of text is perceived very poorly.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Let's see how the description of business processes happens.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Let's say we have highlighted

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
the business process of the upper level.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Let's say this is a business process

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
of, for example,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
trading,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
as we looked at the example of companies,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
tea trading.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Here is a business process of tea trading.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Tea trading.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Of course, there are many other business processes

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
here and here and here.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Then we will describe

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
these business processes

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
in more detail.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
That is, tea trading in this case

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
will consist of several sub-processes.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
We remember that tea trading

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
includes

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
purchasing,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
then it includes

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
storage,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
then the letter H,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
and then

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
selling, the letter P.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Accordingly, this is a business process

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
of the highest level.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
This is a model

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
when we write what is at the entrance,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
what is at the exit,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
what documents,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
products, services, and so on

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
at the entrance and at the exit.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
We call this model

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
BPA, Business Process Allocation.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
When we go down

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
and describe

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
what sub-processes,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
what functions are included

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
in this business process of the upper level,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
we call it DFD.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
The description is called DFD.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
It is called Data Flow Diagram.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Then, when we

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
describe each of these functions

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
in more detail,

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
that is, up to the point that

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
the purchase, for example, the product is ordered,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
then we placed it,

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
here it is placed the order,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
then if the order, for example,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
passed the supplier,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
then it is placed,

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
if it did not pass, then it is placed before the order,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
and so on and so forth.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
This is called the DFD scheme,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Workflow Diagram.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
That is, it is already an analogue

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
of the algorithm.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
This is the lowest level of the business process description.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
That is, in principle,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
we can say that

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
when you have a company,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
the business process description takes place,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
here all the processes of the upper level are located,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
here they are described,

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
all the works that are included in them,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
and then, if you want to write

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
each work in more detail,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
then we move on to the VFD model.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
That is, remember again,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
BPA, DFD,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
or DFD in English,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
and VFD.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Everything is very simple.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
You may ask,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
why describe all the processes

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
as they are so deeply?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Maybe they are already at this level, not optimal.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Why is this done?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Everything is very simple.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
You do not need to describe absolutely all the processes

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
to this level, you do not need to describe

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
to the very application, to the level

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
that the secretary should bring tea to someone,

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
it is absolutely not necessary.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
The idea is to describe these processes

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
and describe this one.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
At this level, you will,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
let's say, a little like scanning

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
this process.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
That is, you go down from top to bottom

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
until you find an error at some level.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
If the errors are highlighted at this level,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
you can stop and start the analysis.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
If the errors are not highlighted at this level,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
you can go further, further, further,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
until you reach the description

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
of business processes at the level of an employee.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
What do we have here?

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
What do we have next?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
If, for example,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
we stop to describe in more detail

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
the business process

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
at the highest level,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
we can describe who is the supplier

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
of the very resource,

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
or information,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
or product,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
or service that is being

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
poured at the entrance.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
That is, we have a supplier

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
and some resource.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Then we have the process itself,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
and then we have a client,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
who needs all this,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
and the result of the process.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
For each business process

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
at the highest level,

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
it is important to develop such a scheme

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
just to test yourself.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Maybe you highlighted the business process

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
at the highest level incorrectly,

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
maybe you highlighted it insufficiently,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
maybe you cut off a part of the business process

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
and cannot highlight its client.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
If you cannot find a client of a business process,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
if you cannot understand what the result of the process is,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
maybe you highlighted it incorrectly.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
This means that you need to re-examine

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
the business process highlighting

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
at the highest level.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Then, when we go down to the level of DFD,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
we do the following thing.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
We write what kind of work

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
should be done,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
what are the entrances and exits

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
of each of the jobs,

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
what are the resources

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
at the entrance and at the exit,

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
what are the executors

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
of each job,

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
what are the employees of each job.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
It is also very important to do this,

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
because at this stage

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
you can make a mistake

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
and highlight the business process incorrectly.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
At the same stage,

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
you can make a wrong description of the functions.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It is important to understand

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
that the results are absolutely

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
in every function.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Next, when we describe the lowest level,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
we write, again,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
who is responsible

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
for each of these small functions,

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
what is the entrance,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
what is the exit,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
and what are the algorithms,

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
what if this,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
what actions should be taken,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
what if there is no action,

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
what actions should be taken.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
All this should be described

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
to the smallest detail,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
so that the executor at the lowest level

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
would understand what to do in each case.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Only then this algorithm

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
can be considered, optimized

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
and turned into a regulation

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
for the employees.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It is important to remember

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
that the entrance at this level

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
is the entrance at this level.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
If, for example,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
you have a need for a product

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
at the entrance,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
then you should have a need for a product

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
at the entrance.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
If you have a product at the entrance,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
then you are already buying,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
this is illogical.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
This process at the level of DFD

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
is revealed in more detail.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
The entrance of this process

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
goes here,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
the exit of this process goes here.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Thus, we have a more detailed

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
structured of this process.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
When we describe in more detail

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
some process here,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
we transfer the entrance here.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
When we talk about the exit,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
we transfer it here.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Everything should be described

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
very clearly.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
It should not be like

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
here is one entrance,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
here is another one,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and so on.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
There is more detail

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
in the description.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
What options

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
can we use

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
to find information

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
for this description?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I think you know

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
that there are many ways.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
The first one,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
which I said several times today,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
is a working seminar.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
It means that you

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
discuss the description

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
of this process,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
its suppliers,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
its clients,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and you discuss

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
this description

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
with them.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
After it is approved,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
you can let go

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
some of the employees

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and talk only with those

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
who, for example,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
are responsible for this process

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
and approve the regulation

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
and discuss it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
The disadvantages are that

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
it can turn into a mess

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
if you do not prepare for it in advance.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
The second option is an interview.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It means that you,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
as a business analyst

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
or a methodologist

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
of the Business Process Analysis Department,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
make an appointment

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
with a particular person,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
a participant or a person

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
responsible for a particular

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
business process or process.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It means that the meeting will be

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
one-on-one.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Or you can take an assistant

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
who will record if you do not have time

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
to ask or record something.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Thus,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
it is a tete-a-tete conversation.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
You can, in fact,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
devote more time

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
to the specific performer

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and to find out how this business

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
process is going on now.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
But

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
there is a point here.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
We are all people

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and we are all inclined to lie,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
to cheat a little,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
to make a little deal,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
to fantasize a little.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And very often people,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
when you talk to them

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
about how the business process

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
is going on now,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
start to cheat and add

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
something from the area

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
as it should be,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
as I see it,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and so on.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
After the work seminar

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
or before the work seminar,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
what is better,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
make a list.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
A list of all people

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
you would like to talk to.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It will be the process owner,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
supplier, client

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and a couple of key participants.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Make a list,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
meet with everyone,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
make a special questionnaire

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
and tell everyone

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
how this business process is going on.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Everyone will be cheating,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
but in the end, when you compare

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
the answers of everyone,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
you will be able to form your opinion

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
about how it is going on now.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Meet with other participants

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
of similar processes,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
for example, client processes

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
or supplier processes.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Make it clear.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
The more you make it clear,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
the more accurate your situation

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
will be.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
There is an option

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
to ask a lot of people

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
for one or two questions.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
You can use

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
questionnaire

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and questionnaire.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
You can either give it to your employees

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
or send it on the Internet,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
by e-mail,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
post it on the server,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
and so on.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
In other words,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
you have a questionnaire

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and you ask certain employees

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
to fill it in.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
You can use it

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
if you need to clarify some detail.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
It is impossible to ask a person

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
to describe the business process

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
in a questionnaire.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
He will describe it in a nutshell

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
or he will describe the main points.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
In short, it will not bring any useful value

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
to you.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So, the easiest way is

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
to use a questionnaire or questionnaire.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Next.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You can use

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
your existing documents and regulations

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
to ask a person

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
for a specific question.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But this is the last tool

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
you need to use.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Why?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
As we said,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
all documents are written

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
in a way

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
that is convenient for you.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
No one uses them.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
They are stored on shelves

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and no one uses them.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
When you show your document

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
to the person,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
he will be surprised and ask

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
if he should do it.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So, documents are

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
just additional sources of information

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
to check if you forgot something.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
once again,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
work seminars, interviews,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
questionnaires and documents.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Regulations.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Using this list,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
you can describe all business processes

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
up to the lowest level.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
How to conduct

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
an interview with a person?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
How to conduct a work seminar?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
This is a question

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
of psychology.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
But I can say

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
that you should

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
have a conversation like a conversation with yourself.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I can say from my experience

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
that when a person

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
is called for an interview,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
it doesn't matter if it is a manager

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
or a manager,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
he is afraid

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
that he will be fired

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
for this interview.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
He will be fired,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
his salary will be reduced,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
he will be reprimanded.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Maybe he doesn't know

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
what he is afraid of,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
but he is afraid.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So, it is important to put him to yourself.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
It means that you should ask

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
open questions.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You should ask questions

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
like how to do it,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
why you do it

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and what you do here.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
It should be a

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
pleasant environment

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
in which you can

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
get enough information

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
about your business process.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It is important

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
to give your interviewer

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
a space,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
a field for action.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
If you limit him

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
to specific questions,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
you may not get

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
any additional information

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
about your business process

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
or about the business process

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
of a client or a supplier.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
You should describe all business processes.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
So, there is no unnecessary information.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
All interviews are very important

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and all seminars are very important.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So, you should write down

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
information on a dictaphone

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
or on a stenograph

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
or something else.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Then it is collected in a file

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and processed.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Because in one interview

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
you can write down

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
all the information

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
about your business process

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and about other processes.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
It is clear that

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
you should speak

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
in a pleasant way,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
ask questions,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
look good and behave well.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
But the most important thing

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
is to give your interviewer

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
a space for imagination

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and to express himself

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
to the maximum.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
The form of the form

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
is quite standard.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
You can see it

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
on the following slide.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
In fact,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
there is nothing complicated.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
You just need to write down

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
what business process is

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
and then give an opportunity

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
to send it to the person

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
you are going to show

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
the application to.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
You just need to write down

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
what operations are included,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
what are the requirements

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
and what are the requirements

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
for the application.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
There is nothing complicated.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
But I repeat that

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
the application is more like

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
an additional thing.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
You don't need to start

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
with the application right away.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
People still don't know

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
how to do it.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So they get confused

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
and ask questions.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
It is easier to start

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
with the application

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and then go on with the process.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
There are several rules

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
about business modeling.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The first one is

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
to confirm and clarify

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
what you wrote

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
or created.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Because it is great to be creative

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
but you need to create a scheme

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
as we remember.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
So you need to clarify

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
all the schemes and descriptions

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
you created

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
and you can't accept it

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
as a given.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The second one is

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
to use a dictaphone

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
when you are conducting

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
an interview

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
or a survey

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
or a seminar.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
You need to use a dictaphone,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
a notebook, a pen and so on.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
You don't need to rely on

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
memorizing everything.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
You need to record everything.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And there are a lot of things

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
you can do with a dictaphone.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
If you are shy,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
record everything by hand.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
You can use your colleagues

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
and conduct an interview

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
or a seminar.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
You can use

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
a simplified language

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
to conduct an interview.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
If you come to an unprepared person

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and ask him

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
to describe the business process

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
of your company,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
what do you think

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
he will say?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I think he won't say anything good.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So use something he understands.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Put yourself in his shoes.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
How would you react

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
if you were told

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and you didn't attend any seminars

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
or conduct any training?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
You probably didn't understand

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
what I was talking about.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
So use a simple,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
understandable and accessible language.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Don't be distracted

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
by the current organizational structures

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and who obeys whom.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Remember that processes

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
and structures are secondary.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Remember the goal

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
of the process management

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
of your company

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
when you make a description.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
It shouldn't be a description.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Let everyone like it.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
We had one client.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
They made a lot of great business processes

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
up to the lowest level.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
They were like

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
a secretary or a cleaner.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
We asked them

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
what was the goal

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
of their description.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
They didn't answer.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
They said

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
it was great

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
and they understood

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
who obeys whom.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
We described the scheme

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and what's next.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I think it's nothing special.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So if you don't remember the goal

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and don't know why you do it,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
it's better not to do it.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
So always remember

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
the goal,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
why you do it,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
your role in it

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and the current status

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
of the process management.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
And one more important thing.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Always remember

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
that there are situations

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
when you do it right,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
when you do it wrong,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
when you do it wrong,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
when you do it right,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
when you do it wrong,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
when you do it right.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
There are situations

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
when you want to do it right.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
You don't need to confuse

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
all three options.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
You need to do it right.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
That's why you need

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
so many details

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
and so many ways

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
to get information

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
like seminars, interviews,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
surveys, documents, etc.
