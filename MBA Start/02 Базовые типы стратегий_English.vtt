WEBVTT

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.980
We have considered the second part of

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.120
our lecture, we have considered growth

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.240
strategies with you, and now we

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.720
are moving to the third part of our

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.080
lecture, namely competitive strategies.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.460
Dear colleagues, I wanted to remind

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.140
you that today we are considering

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.040
business strategies that are divided

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.660
into three sub-types.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.000
These are portfolio strategies, growth

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.380
strategies and competitive strategies.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.340
We have already considered two sub-specifics,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.800
these are portfolio strategies,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.100
this is also what we have

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
considered with you growth strategies.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.520
I want to remind you that we talked

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.700
about integration, we talked

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.000
about diversification, we talked

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.520
about getting leadership at the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.000
expense of either cost or differentiation

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.120
and specialization.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.800
Now we go to the competitive

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.660
strategies.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.280
Competitive strategies,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.760
in fact, determine how the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.800
enterprise will provide competitive

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.900
advantage in the market in

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.900
terms of the high attraction

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.860
of potential consumers, and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.800
what policy the company should

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.360
choose to compete

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.900
with its competitors.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.240
Competitive strategies, when we talk

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.040
about them, we can’t fail to

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.100
mention competitive advantages.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.220
We have already talked to you about gaining

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.380
competitive advantage, speaking about

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.780
specialization strategies, differentiation

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.680
strategies, and getting and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.080
reducing costs, but, nevertheless,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.560
this is necessary in this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.800
block of strategy.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.500
What is a competitive advantage?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.120
These are the characteristics of

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.940
the company’s market activity, which

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.880
create a certain superiority over its

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.920
competitors and allow you to obtain

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.040
the desired profit and maintain

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.320
strong positions in the market.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.580
According to Porter’s general

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.820
competitive matrix, competitive

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.780
advantage can be achieved

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.060
through either product

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.200
leadership, price leadership,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.160
or niche leadership.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.760


00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.560
As for product leadership,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.520
we have already said that it can

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.100
be achieved in various

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.780
ways, either by reducing

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.320
costs, or by achieving a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.320
differential advantage,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.300
or by some kind of concentration.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.740
Price leadership is most likely

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.400
to reduce costs, and niche

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.640
leadership is to concentrate

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.720
activity.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.500
In this case, we are talking about

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.800
the growth strategies we have just

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.340
considered and the competitive

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.320
strategies, they are interrelated,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.160
and one strategy flows

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.080
into another.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.580
In this case, it is very difficult

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.960
to divide between competitive

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.420
strategies and growth strategies,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.920
because as a company develops

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.660
and grows, it is already

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.100
trying to a competitive

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.360
advantage.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.720
The Porter's general competitive matrix

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.200
is presented as follows.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.500
How can we a competitive advantage?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.960
The cost reduction we talked

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.940
about, the differential

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.980
advantage we talked about,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.180
is price leadership, product

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740
leadership, and niche leadership.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.200


00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.460
We will talk to you about each of the types

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.540
of leadership.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.780
Product leadership, I said,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.820
is achieved through differentiation,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.680
through product

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.740
improvement, packaging,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.460
design, and so on.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.820
Price leadership is a game of prices,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.180
it is a cost reduction, it is a standardization

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.440
of quality, it is a cost

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.280
management.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.240
In this case, I would like to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.520
point out that the use of the law of

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.240
experience and the law of scale in

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.260
this case should be used by companies.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.900
Well, also leadership in a niche

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.700
is focusing on certain

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.060
niches.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.740
A niche is a segment that has not

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.840
yet been identified and

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.260
needs that have not yet been met.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.320
Well, for example, the segment is,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.920
for example, shampoos for oily hair,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.440
and the niche is a shampoo for

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.900
hair loss for oily hair.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.440
That is, it is the satisfaction

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.600
of some specific

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.580
needs that have not yet been met.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.860
Once they are satisfied, identified,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.940
satisfied, the niche grows

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.100
into a segment.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.140
Well, we have to say that leadership

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.520
in the niche is most often used

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.540
by small business enterprises because

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.160
of the fact that large companies sometimes

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.300
have a difficult time segmenting them

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.700
so, so, and carefully

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.440
segmenting their consumers.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.040
And they, even by carrying out

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.020
a very detailed way, by careful

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.540
segmentation, many large companies

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.940
do not choose these segments as

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.380
their target markets.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.540
Especially the niche.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.900
And small companies, just realizing

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.500
their competitive advantage,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.500
choose either niches or small

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.320
segments as their target

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.200
segments.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.100
That is, those segments that they

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.100
pay close attention to and

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.300
with which they work.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.400
Possible strategies for achieving

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.600
andining a competitive advantage

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.040
are presented in the competitive

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.600
advantage matrix, and we will

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.060
present them in the table

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.400
you will now see, the competitive

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.540
advantage matrix.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.540
The table, as you can see, consists of

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.320
three main charts, which are market

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.300
positions, forward strategies and

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.320
passive strategies.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.300
In the market position, companies can

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.740
occupy three main positions.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.520
These are companies that are

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.560
leaders, companies that are pursuers

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.340
of market leaders and companies that avoid

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.300
direct competition.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.420
And, as Kotler says, the type

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.980
of strategy chosen depends on the

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.280
position and market share that

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.700
the company occupies.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.680
I have to say that the company

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.800
leader will be a large

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.860
large company that occupies

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.460
a leading position, which

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.080
aggressively conducts its

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.660
marketing strategies and

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.400
which select target segments,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.620
large such target segments,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.840
and works with them.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.740
I have to say that we will be more

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.360
interested in this lecture two other

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.720
types - companies-

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.100
followers or pursuers of

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.500
market leaders and companies

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.240
that avoid direct competition.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.780
The companies-pursuiters or market

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.630
leaders are those companies that

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.500
understand that they cannot become market

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.520
leaders, but they use strategies

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.000
similar to either the companies-leaders

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.900
of the market, or simply attack,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.740
as you see, the attack, breakthrough,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.460
or surroundings.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.080
And companies that avoid direct

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.400
competition are most likely either

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.700
medium or even small companies,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.720
who understand that they, due

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.720
to their size, cannot compete

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.000
with a large large company,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.120
with a leader.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.460
And they choose such a strategy

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.300
to avoid competition and find

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.980
their some lower segments

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.640
and work with them.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.640
I have to say that market pursuers

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.280
are companies that most often

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.500
do not occupy dominant positions,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.840
but can challenge such

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.580
a leader.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.480
And those who avoid are companies

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.040
that agree with their position in

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.920
the market.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.780
Well, if we look at this table,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.880
we will see that there are two

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.100
types of strategies here.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.640
We see pre-emptive strategies and

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.540
passive strategies.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.100
Preventive strategies are

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.220
those strategies that companies

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.360
use to protect themselves,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.360
to bite a leader, so

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.380
to speak.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.980
And passive strategies are

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.740
those strategies that involve

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.520
simply following the leader,

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.620
when small companies just go

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.140
in general and use their position

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.880
and just do not change any,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.640
without making any sharp

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.640
moves, just follow the courses.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.520
So, we see that companies

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.080
pursuing market leaders use such

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.420
preventive strategies as attack,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.960
breakthrough and surrounding.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.720
Passive strategy

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.820
as a course.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.220
And companies that avoid direct

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.700
competition use such preventive

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.920
strategies as coexistence

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.360
on site or bypass.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.280
A passive strategy is to maintain positions.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.860
We will look at these strategies on the example

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.020
of a sustainable strategy for small and medium-

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.060
sized enterprises.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.400
So we move to the last section of our

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.000
lecture and talk about sustainable strategy

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.180
for small and medium-sized

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.600
companies.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.460
First, let’s define small and medium-

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.440
sized companies.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.480
What are these companies?

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.740
These are companies that have small

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.300
market shares or medium market

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.120
shares.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.300
They either cannot or do not even

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.760
seek to take a leadership position.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.640
These are companies that either

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.980
operate in local markets, or in national

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.760
markets, or in general in some

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.860
narrow geographical markets

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.380
and do not seek to go

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.240
out and expand their positions.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.920
But that doesn’t mean that these

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.900
companies have no weight or

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.940
take no positions.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.580
Absolutely not.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.960
They can compete even with leaders

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.440
by providing some advantages,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.980
competitors at the

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.040
expense of their specialization.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.360


00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.580
Let’s look at some strategies that

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.340
small and medium-sized companies use.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.960
There are two types of

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.880
pre-emptive strategies

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.620
and passive strategies.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.980
The company’s preventive strategies

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.840
that are the pursuit of a leader are

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.480
either a frontal attack or

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.700
a frontal attack.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.600
It is that the company uses

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.100
against the competitor

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.520
the same means that the leader

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.920
uses and tries to detect

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.120
the weaknesses.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.780
And in order to be successful,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.340
this frontal attack requires

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.640
considerable superiority.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.580
Therefore, in order to

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.560
superiority over a leader,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.900
a certain ratio is necessary.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.300
Usually it’s three to one

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.080
to represent a competitive advantage.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.900
To be honest, a small head attack

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.580
is a rather risky strategy

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.060
because companies may not

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.420
be able to calculate

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.420
their capabilities.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.180
And if they do not have

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.320
this superiority, price

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.420
superiority, product price

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.980
superiority, or distribution

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.060
superiority and the ratio of

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.400
3.1 is restored, they may not

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.400
their goals and not be able to

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.780
somehow beat the leader.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.600
I have to say that many small

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.480
companies have tried to attack

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.840
leaders, but they have failed.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.060
However, there are also examples

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.480
of successful use of this

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.220
strategy.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.900
For example, IBM, which was at

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.440
its initial stage, began an

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.040
attack on the computer market,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.760
it was in the 1980s and 1990s,

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.600
and began to release its

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.320
personal computers, such as

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.780
competitors Apple, Commodore,

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.080
Tandy and the like.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.300
However, she was able to become

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.220
the leader only in two years.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.640
I have to say that this company

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.800
even at that time was already a medium-

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.140
sized company, so if we talk about

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.380
medium-sized and small companies,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.900
then they are unlikely

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.080
to use this strategy.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.300
It really requires a lot of

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.840
money, and companies then have

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.040
to use a very strong

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.920
leadership strategy by cutting

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.280
costs, but that won’t always

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.180
lead to quality improvement.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.120


00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.260
Therefore, it is very problematic

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.220
here, because the company

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.980
will either reduce quality and

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.280
reduce price by reducing costs,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.580
but it may not this product

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.000
leadership.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.000
The next strategy is a breakthrough

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.700
or flank attack.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.520
It involves using any of

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.620
the leader’s weaknesses and finding

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.820
a gap.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.080
It can, for example, be

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.100
targeted at any region or care

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.680
network where a dominant

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.540
firm is not as well represented

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.100
as that segment as another

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:20.800
company, or it is the segment

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.260
for which this product of

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.720
that leader is not very adapted.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.960
The classic strategy is to challenge,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.120
challenge through the price, in other

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.020
words, to lower the price.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.220
Again, here is a strategy

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.360
of reducing the improvement

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.440
of leadership by reducing costs.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.720
I have to say that this

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.460
strategy was used by breakthrough

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.500
or flank attack, used by

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.240
many Japanese companies

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.340
that entered the American

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.200
car market.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.880
Again, we can say that these companies

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.880
were no longer small, they

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.840
were large enough companies.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.860
What did they do?

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.640
They went on the market with a

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.080
base model, if you remember, we

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.400
once talked about the Antsov matrix.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.140
That is, they were already existing

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.480
goods on the new market, and

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.320
they came out because they reduced

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.500
the price of their base models.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.600
In relation to American

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.320
cars, they occupied

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.760
a leading position, because,

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.900
first, they were more

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.500
economical cars, second,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.220
they had better quality,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.440
and third, they were

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.960
sold at a lower price

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.160
compared to American cars.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.040
And, fourth, the Japanese developed

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.000
their dealers’ networks very well,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.220
so this allowed the company to

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.400
attack frontally.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.540
However, this strategy is not very

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.800
applicable to medium and small

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.780
companies.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.520
Third, strategy is the environment, the

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.840
gradual accumulation of advantages over

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.540
the leader by studying his weaknesses,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.280
bypassing the competitor from different

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.860
sides.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.560
This strategy is

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.720
used widely by companies

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.300
that are medium-

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.520
sized or small.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.640
Here is a good example – the Matreška

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.720
restaurant chain, and the leader of

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.660
the direct competitor – the Yelki-

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.900
Palk restaurant chain.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.240
It must be said that the chain of restaurants

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.680
"Elkie-Palk" appeared earlier than

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.260
"Matreschka", and

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.440
its competitive advantage was that

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.020
the chain of fairly inexpensive

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.600
restaurants was called tractors,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.040
which represented quite high-

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.280
quality home food at not

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.360
so high prices.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.960
One of the competitors was the

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.140
Swedish table.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.400
But the company "Matrixka", which came

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:51.600
out in the market in 96-97 years,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.640
gradually began to accumulate

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.500
advantages over the leader.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.140
What did they do?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.600
First, they used the same

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.780
strategy, they followed

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.640
the leader, but unlike the

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.620
Yelky-Palk restaurants,

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.080
where only the approach to the

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.680
Swedish table was practiced, they

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.780
began to practice an unlimited

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.100
approach to the Swedish table,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.400
and also expanded the

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.040
range of dishes on the Swedish

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.600
table.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.580
For almost the same price, a

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.600
person could have lunch, and

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.040
he could also approach the

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.460
Swedish table as often as

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.980
possible.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.940
Therefore, this company Matreška used

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.160
the surrounding and gradually

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.260
began to replace all these restaurants

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.060
"Elk-Palk".

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.900
And we can say that we can see even

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.640
such a local example, such as

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.000
this restaurant, the Matreška restaurant

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.440
chain has superseded the Yelki-

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.880
Palki restaurants.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.020
Metro Tretyakovskaya, there are

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.660
now these two restaurants, and when

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.000
Matreška, the Matreškaya

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.880
restaurant network, began

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.520
to go aggressively enough to market,

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.140
the restaurant Yelki-Palki was

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.560
forced to close and transfer

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.400
it to cooking.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.320
Thus, it turned out that the

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.120
company “Matrixka” gradually

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.640
surrounded the competitor and used

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.940
his weaknesses and advantages

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.760
in its direction.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.560
The following strategies are

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.300
strategies for concentrating forces

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.280
in profitable areas.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.180
This is a selection of market segments

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.420
where attracting the attention of

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.280
stronger competitors.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.640
This strategy is used

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.600
by small companies.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.540


00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.060
And the next strategy, which is

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.540
very similar to the previous ones

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.440
- is bypassing, avoiding competition

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.280
by releasing non-competitive goods,

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.520
using services that are

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.100
unattractive to competitors sales

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.840
channels and more.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.420
Examples of these strategies are,

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.400
for example, construction markets

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.720
such as the Kashir Court, Strugino

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.680
and many others, which sell

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.120
goods similar to those sold

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.440
in ABI, Laura-Ameren

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.620
and others.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.860
But at less high prices, that is, at

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.480
lower prices, they do not compete

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.760
with them, because, for example,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.840
the Strictly market is adjacent

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.980
to Lora-Amherlen and is rather

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.160
peacefully adjacent.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.620
Everyone leaves their activities.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.600
Why this happens?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.160
Because the company Strong

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.220
Market, which consists of

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.440
many-many sellers, sells goods,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.340
of course, they use completely

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.640
different sales channels, they

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.240
do not provide such services

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.700
as the large stores ABI

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.800
and Lorra-Amérén, they do not use unattractive

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.320
enough sales channels,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.680
sales points are also quite

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.340
unattractive, but they

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.400
have their consumers who

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.280
are willing to accept such

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.500
inconvenience, but buy goods,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.040
building materials

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.680
and the like, at lower

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.920
prices.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.520
We have discussed strategies that

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.540
can be attributed to the

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.040
pre-emptive, and now we will look

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.940
at passive strategies with you.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.920
Passive strategies are those strategies

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.240
that involve adaptive behavior, that

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.420
is, companies decide to coordinate

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.300
their actions, focusing on the leader,

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.240
they continue to go along the current,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.500
they do not go against the current,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720
they coexist peacefully with the

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.920
leader, because they understand

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.500
that they will not be able

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.580
to compete with him.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.100
And, of course, passive strategies

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.060
are more typical of small

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.740
business companies, even, not medium,

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.760
but small business.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.880
If the preemptive strategies can be attributed

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.800
to the latch strategy of the medium-sized

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.380
business, then the passive strategies

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.960
are mainly used by the small business

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.140
company.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.460
And we must say

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.840
that such behavior

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.420
can be used in situations

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.740
of oligopoly or just

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.600
when companies understand

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.260
that they are just

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.060
profitable to

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.880
fight with

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.560
the leader but we

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.940
must say that this

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.560
behavior is this consistency

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.960
and world-existence

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.520
with the leader in

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.880
general does not mean

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.640
that companies

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.900
can not have any

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.440
competitive strategy

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.000
in contrast to the

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.780
very first part of

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.160
the lecture, there

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.080
are small companies

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.980
and small share ownership

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.800
it is enhancing

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.840
the importance

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.840
of such strategic

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.700
points as differentiation

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.540
and giving their

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.700
consumers competitive

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.020
advantages well

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.300
and we must

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.740
say that these companies

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.240
with a small share

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.060
they will not necessarily

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.580
be dead load

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.680
or there dogs

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.240
we talked about

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.700
in the first part

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.320
of the lecture

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.120
they are just

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.800
looking for attention

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.260
between the development

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.000
and if they build

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.360
them to include

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.580
the Boston consulting

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.640
matrix there

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.740
they have

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.240
their strategic

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.920
signs to

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.780
increase

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.840
their interests

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.660
only their

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.660
stars and

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.760
their

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.880
dogs need

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.340
that

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.300
they

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.160


00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.280
And they will strive for specialization

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.380
and will not even try to

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.080
increase their market share.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.520
Well, of course, strong leadership,

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.080
the influence of the manager is very

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.520
important, because the strategy

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.240
is formed, the overall strategy

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.380
is formed by the strategy, and,

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.180
of course, the management of the

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.120
company must report to itself

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.900
where it wants to lead its company.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.740
All these parameters

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.000
are applied by many companies

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.340
that work in the service

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.460
sector.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.880
For example, it is a restaurant

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.680
business, it is small hotels,

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.600
it is companies that are engaged

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.920
in the sale of some food,

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.440
small companies, small shops,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.040
sewing clothes and the like.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.600
They all really survive through

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.560
these aspects.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.620
Passive strategy studies behind the

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.820
leader, thus they do not imply

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.060
passive behavior, but rather

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.100
the care of the management

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.840
about choosing the strategy.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.280
That is, in this case, the management

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.980
understands the place of the company

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.260
and they just develop their

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.060
strategy and go systematically, without

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.400
crossing the path to the leader,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.900
because if they cross the path

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.140
to the leader, they will immediately

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.380
be destroyed.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.240
We will look at several strategies that

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.840
are quite typical for small and medium-sized

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.540
companies.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.260
The first is to follow the course.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.040
That is, a company that chooses

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.920
this passive strategy by following

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.120
the course, it is based

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.180
on the fact that it will minimize

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.960
the risk of the leader’s response,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.260
that is, in the pricing

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:07.860
policy.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.680
In other words, the company will

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.740
not cross with the leader in

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.380
price policy.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.940
They will provide some services

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.660
or goods at a lower price.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.400
By the way, the quality of the services

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.060
or goods provided may not be worse

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.340
than the leader, but it will not

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.860
cross with the leader in this

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.460
position.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.820
For example, small car repair

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.620
companies.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.160
We still have many of these

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.100
companies, car drivers know,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.300
car service providers who prefer

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.220
not to compete with official

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.840
authorized car repair dealers,

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.120
but represent a very

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.040
wide range of services.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.500
And, of course, there will

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.480
be fragmented activities, and narrow

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.280
specialization, and a fairly individual

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.640
approach to the client.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.580
Well, for example, I can say

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.900
that many people who have

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.760
good enough cars, however, prefer not

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.820
to turn to authorized dealers,

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.260
who have quite high prices,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.060
and sometimes, if it is not large

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.220
enough repair, prefer to turn

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.000
to their, so to speak,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.240
already well-known masters

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.980
in small car service, because

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.040
they know that they will

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.700
quality service and repair

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.600
their car.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.140
And, by the way, in this case, the

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.620
law of experience will work very well here.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.480
The next strategy is a strategy

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.760
of preserving positions.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.220
This strategy, a passive

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.240
strategy, aims to maintain a consistency

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.920
in market activity that does

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.420
not attract the attention

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.320
of competitors.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.100
Well, if we look at the previous

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.600
strategy, we will see that they

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.520
are very similar.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.160
Here in this case, if the prior

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.960
strategy emphasizes that the company

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.560
minimizes the risk of response actions,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.160
mainly price policy, then

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.380
here the company simplyins consistency

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.800
in market activity and also that

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.780
this strategy will

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.800
be dropped from the previous

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.700
one, does not cause the attention

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.300
of competitors.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.100
What is it?

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:06.900
This is the activity

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.540
of small food and commercial

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.340
stores, shops-tent.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.820
They are not at all looking

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.320
to compete with large and medium-

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.960
sized companies, not by range,

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.500
not by logistics of some complex,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.980
but most often they survive because

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.180
of the fact that they are located

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.580
near the house, this is a

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.760
convenient location.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.660
Offices or stations, say,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.920
and attract consumers with

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.860
their price and low prices,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.260
and freshness of products,

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.820
because very often this product

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.420
is presented very

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.000
daily.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.020
We have looked at the main strategies,

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.840
passive strategies and preventive

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.300
strategies that small and medium-

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.580
sized companies enjoy.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.320
But I have to say that besides this

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:56.720
classification, I am quite

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.900
interested in which represents

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.580
four main strategies.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.720
We will consider if you look at

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.800
this table, we will consider

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.620
four main strategies.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.620
The characteristics of a small company

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.540
and the form of existence of a small company.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.580
Here, there are four parameters, regardless

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.800
of the large company, a small

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.780
company can exist or is associated

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.900
with a large company.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.500
There are also two aspects

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.720
of the product.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.480
It is a product that is similar

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.420
to a large company product, or it is

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.420
a shino original product.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.400
We see four possibilities here.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.660
A rather interesting strategy is

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.360
a false influenza strategy, when

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.780
a company is independent of a

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.260
large firm, but produces a product

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.820
similar to a large firm.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.720
Next is a chameleon, a company

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.820
that produces products that are

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.040
similar to a large company’

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.840
s product and are associated with a

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.800
large company.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.360
She uses her advantage.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.920
And the other two strategies are a

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.920
straight-piscal strategy, when a

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.600
company produces an aggregate

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.740
product and independently of a large

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.820
firm, thereby abstracting and

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.680
trying to float along the current.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.240
The last strategy is a

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.180
roaring bee.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.160
The company produces an original product,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.280
but it is related to a large company,

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.080
that is, a strategy of participation in

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.060
the production of products.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.120
We will now look at these strategies

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.260
in more detail.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.220
The strategy of the false flu is small

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.200
firms that survive in the market,

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.180
producing so-called counterfeits.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.420
Sometimes it is legal, sometimes

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.960
it is illegal.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.140
The company copies the products

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.160
of large companies and uses the

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.240
me to product strategy.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.040
If the company uses this strategy

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.180
and registers its products,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.540
and registers under a different

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.080
trademark than the product

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.820
leader, then this is in

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.720
this case quite a completely

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.780
legal activity, and

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.080
so do many companies.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.240
If a company uses a me to product strategy,

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.920
in other words, it simply uses counterfeits

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.360
and uses the power and

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:19.140
power of the company’s leading

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.900
products, it is illegal.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.560
Many Chinese goods use a false

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.520
flu strategy and are

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.420
quite illegal in the market.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.880
We all know, for example, Big pen,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.880
French pen, this BIC is written,

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.060
very many companies, unfortunately,

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.200
Chinese companies, share products

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.900
and write not BIC, but BIK,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.700
BKA and the like, well, they

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.360
produce pen.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.420
Of course, they also use

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.580
a strategy to benefits by

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.620
reducing costs and the like.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.040
The fake flu strategy, however,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.820
no matter how you can see, is to

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.680
flush out of other companies.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.000
Well, we must say, if we talk about

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.760
legal such application of this strategy,

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.440
it can be applied only in those areas

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.820
where the main producers invest

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.840
a lot in NEOCR or Research and

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.880
Development and receive at least

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.060
15% of revenue in connection

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:23.180
with the presentation of information

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.520
on the public communication

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.880
channel of advertising.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.460
Well, for example, in this case,

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.140
an example of not very legal

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.960
use of the name Adidas is given.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.840
Adamas uses the product,

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.480
it capitalizes on the name Adidas

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.120
and can create such a small confusion

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.260
in the consumption mind,

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.820
so say, and people start simply

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.360
confusing the two names

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.880
and buy Adamas products.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.600
Well, I would like to say that

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.460
this strategy is a false flu,

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.860
it is, if it is used legally,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.760
it is used by companies, very

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.420
many companies, small companies.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.940
They use, in general, they follow

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.380
the leader, they passively simply

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.280
take and use the advantage

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.520
of the leader’s company.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.540
That is, they take and use all

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.920
the leadership and find their

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.140
consumer, because they sell

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.500
this product at a reduced

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.040
price.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.160
If the company uses this strategy

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.600
illegally enough, it is already

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.300
an illegal business.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.840
And I repeat that, unfortunately,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.620
a lot of companies in the grey

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.440
market use this strategy.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.920
The next strategy is the Primudra

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.200
and Piskar strategy.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.280
If you remember, this strategy refers

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.200
to the fact that Primudre and

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.340
Piskar is a company that produces

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.040
an original product and independent

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.180
of a large firm.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.580
When a company uses the

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.080
Primudra and Piskar strategy,

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.020
it produces a completely

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.400
original product that does not

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.580
interact with the leader.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.300
I have to say that this strategy

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.480
can be somehow compared

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.960
to the strategies we have already

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.140
considered – following the

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.180
course orining positions.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.940
That is,ining consistency that does not

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.660
attract the attention of competitors.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.200
I must say that we see

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.220
family ties.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.400
With this strategy, the scale

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.920
effect does not work.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.900
If the company is doing repairs,

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.600
it is operating in a limited

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.660
market.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.140
Repairing a clock

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.580
and so on.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.760
Mostly small companies that follow

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.820
this strategy, they engage

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.460
in individual activities

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.040
or work with a very narrow

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.720
small segment or even some

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.720
niche.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.300
The next strategy is a small

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.480
company that creates an original

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.560
product, but unlike the previous

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.540
strategy, its products are

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.540
linked to the products of a

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.400
large company.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.900
This happens when a large company

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.740
simply gives some small part

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.200
of the work to a small company

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.080
because it simply doesn’t make

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.860
a profit from producing

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.560
the product.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.420
For example, Toyota, which produces

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.640
machines, parts, axles, engines,

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.480
transmission, and gear parts, simply

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.240
does not make a profit from

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.460
producing related products such

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.000
as blankets or carpets and the like.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.740
And she gives it to other companies.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.320
In principle, such large companies

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.680
can form a vertical marketing

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.700
system, a managed

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.600
marketing system when an

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.120
tender is announced and small

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.580
companies are happy to fight

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.100
to work with a large company

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.680
under its auspices.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.760
Sometimes it is just one-class

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.600
some contractual terms, when the

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.780
company simply performs

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.720
a certain activity of a large company,

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.620
and sometimes it grows into

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.500
the same long-term cooperation.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.240
That is, a company can work under the

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.440
auspices of a large company,

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.940
at least having an independent

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.460
name, it can work in co-authorship under

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.900
the auspices of a large company.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.960
The next strategy is the Camillion strategy.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.960
The strategy is that a small company

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.720
creates a product similar to

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.280
a large company’s product

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.020
but connected to it through

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.300
franchising.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.540
If we talked to you about the first

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.380
strategy, which is called a

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.580
false grapefruit, I will remind

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.480
you, I told you that in many

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.280
cases this strategy is

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.340
used by companies illegally,

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.680
then here in this case

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.120
the company uses completely

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.220
legal mechanisms.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.280
A small company becomes a franchise.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.460
In other words, it purchases

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.360
a license from the franchiser

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.660
and becomes part of the company.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.380
Again, franchising is one

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.140
of the forms of vertical

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.120
markers, it is a contractual

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.860
so-called Navy, so it is

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.920
a very rapidly growing franchising

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.880
to new markets and, we

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.660
must say, it is really legal.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.640
It must be said that now 40-60

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.560
percent of the US store’s output

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.380
operates on the franchise system.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.600
In Russia, franchising

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.580
is developing very rapidly.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.260
This happened because of the fact

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.700
that legislative documents

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.580
appeared, a legislative framework

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.600
appeared, which allowed companies

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.620
to promote their products

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.300
through franchising.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.480
I will name you such companies, large

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.780
and small, that work on the basis of franchising,

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.360
but this is Kodak, this is McDonald's

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.120
, but not in Russia, this is the image of Persona's

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.460
lab, this is franchising, this is,

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.140
if you grow up, the company, this

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.060
is Diana's chemical cleaners, here

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.160
they work on franchising.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.320
In other words, if you want to

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.840
open your business, you can buy

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.960
a license from a franchisee, become

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.680
a franchisee and undergo a training

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.960
course, you are equipped with

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.740
equipment, and you work under the

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.080
auspices of this brand, that is,

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.520
you are part of this company, but

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:30.040
thus you deduct a certain percentage

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.380
to the franchisee under

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.160
the contract.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.600
This is very simple and, as I

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.820
have already said, a very

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.340
common model not only in the United

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.480
States, but also in Russia, except,

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.760
as I have already listed,

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.160
here are examples like Diana,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.440
I also think of Coffee House,

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.600
which is also a franchise

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.480
of the company Sweet Mama,

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.040
which has already been mentioned.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.560
There are many companies that

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.220
are currently working under the

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.560
auspices of franchising.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.280
Thus, we have discussed the

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.600
strategies of medium and small companies,

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.220
and we have in this part of the lecture

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.160
focused on such strategies, which can

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.080
be called preventive strategies and

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.400
passive strategies, as well

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.060
as strategies that are related

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.360
to the characteristics of the

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.680
product and the form of the

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.180
existence of a small company.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.500
A false fungus, a wise sandstone, a chameleon

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.880
and a bee’s sting.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.940
Dear colleagues, our lecture is

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.820
coming to an end.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.800
I think this material will be useful

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.560
to you.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.880
Thank you again for your attention.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:44.240
thanks to.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:44.820
to Goodbye.
