00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
We continue to study the course of financial management.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Today we have the next topic, marginal analysis.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
In this topic, we will consider the following three questions.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
First, we will focus on studying the category of marginal profit.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
In the next question, we will see how this category is applied in the analysis of the margin of profit.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
We will also consider a very important question in the course of financial management, the question of the point of non-profitability.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
And we will finish today's lecture with the operational lever.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
We also introduce this category from the point of view of its practical application in business.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
All costs on the enterprise, depending on the change in the volume of production, can be divided into two groups.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Constant and variable.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Constant costs do not depend on the volume of production.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
No matter how much the volume of production increases, they remain unchanged.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Constant costs are classified in different categories.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
For example, temporary wage, taxes, rent, administrative expenses.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
The second group of costs is variable costs.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
They change in proportion to the growth or reduction of the volume of production.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
If the enterprise increases production, its costs increase.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
If the volume of production decreases, the variable costs decrease.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
The group of variable costs includes the most various costs, but also the most important.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
The costs of raw materials.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
The more production is produced, the more costs are spent on raw materials.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
The cost of this group is the labor wage.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
The more production they produce, the more they pay for the production of this product.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
The same applies to fuel and energy.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
This is the simplest approach to determining the costs of constant and variable costs.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
The relationship between the costs of constant and variable costs can be imagined as follows.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
In this slide, you can see how the costs of constant and variable costs add up to form the total costs.

02:32.000 --> 02:43.000
You can see that the costs are equal to the sum of the costs of constant and variable costs multiplied by the volume of production.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
This is how the total costs of the enterprise are formed.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Let's talk about variable costs.

02:55.000 --> 03:07.000
Variable costs can be divided into proportional, progressive, and degressive, depending on how they change with the increase in the volume of production.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
If the variable costs increase directly proportional to the increase in the volume of production,

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
for example, if the volume of production increases by two times and the variable costs increase by two times,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
then we talk about proportional variable costs.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
But this is not always the case.

03:29.000 --> 03:39.000
The fact is that proportional variable costs only exist when there are no changes in the production process at the enterprise.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
The technology is not improving, there is no increase in labor productivity.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
If these processes are implemented at the enterprise, then we have a different form of variable costs.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
Variable costs can increase either faster or slower than the volume of production increases.

04:02.000 --> 04:14.000
If labor productivity increases, if production efficiency increases, then variable costs increase slower than the volume of production increases.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Then we talk about degressive variable costs.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
For example, the volume of production increased by two times, that is, by 100%, and the variable costs increased by 70%.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Why?

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
Because the new technology has been implemented, which has allowed to save materials, resources, energy, and fuel.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
As a result, the variable costs have increased to a lesser extent than the volume of production.

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
But unfortunately, there are also progressive costs, when the costs increase faster than the volume of production.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
This happens less often, but nevertheless, when the rhythm of production is disrupted,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
when labor productivity decreases, when there are failures at the enterprise,

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
when progressive technology cannot be used, then progressive variable costs take place.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
The costs increase faster than the labor productivity increases.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
This is the worst possible variant of variable costs.

05:24.000 --> 05:35.000
Depending on the variant chosen, the variables can be distinguished.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
The cost-reaction coefficient.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
You can see how it is defined on the slide.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
The cost-reaction coefficient is defined as the change in costs to the change in the volume of production.

05:50.000 --> 06:01.000
If the cost-reaction coefficient is 1, then the changes in the volume of production and the change in variable costs increase proportionally.

06:01.000 --> 06:10.000
If the coefficient is greater than 1, then the costs increase faster than the volume of production.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
And vice versa, if the coefficient is less than 1, then the costs increase slower than the volume of production.

06:18.000 --> 06:28.000
The graph on the slide shows how the costs change with the corresponding increase in the volume of production.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
You can see different variants here.

06:32.000 --> 06:41.000
The coefficient is less than 1, and the coefficient is equal to 1 with proportional costs, or K is greater with progressive costs.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
This is how the costs increase with the increase in the volume of production.

06:48.000 --> 06:58.000
The theoretical question allows us to approach the consideration of the operation of the enterprise.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
We have already discussed three possible variants.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Which one is better?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
The most ideal is the degressive variant.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
This is when the costs increase slower than the volume of production.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
This is the ideal variant.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
And the less the coefficient is, the better.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
The normal variant, the average variant, is the proportional variant,

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
when the variable costs and the volume of production increase to the same degree.

07:36.000 --> 07:46.000
Now, when we know this, those of you who own your own enterprise should pause, stop the recording,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
and look at your own enterprise carefully.

07:50.000 --> 08:02.000
Calculate, or you can ask your economists to calculate how the variable costs increase at your enterprise in relation to the volume of production.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
And then draw a practical conclusion.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
If the costs increase slower than the volume of production, you have an ideal enterprise.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
You can be congratulated on the right path of the development of your enterprise's economy.

08:19.000 --> 08:30.000
If the costs and the volume of production increase proportionally, this is tolerable, this is normal, but this is a borderline situation.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
Because, unfortunately, the variable costs can increase faster than the volume of production.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
This is where you should raise the alarm.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And you should ring all the bells.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
You should look at why the variable costs increase faster than the volume of production.

08:48.000 --> 08:56.000
The thing is, if you don't stop this process, it will lead to the increase in the cost of production.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
The cost will increase more and more.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
And the price at which you produce this product will remain the same.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
If the cost increases and the price remains constant, your profit will decrease, decrease, decrease.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
It will be reduced to zero, and then to losses.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
And that's it, the enterprise will stop its activity.

09:21.000 --> 09:31.000
In order to prevent this from happening, you should pay attention to the ratio of the variable costs and the volume of production.

09:31.000 --> 09:41.000
What should be done to make this coefficient ideal, so that the costs increase slower than the volume of production?

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
You should increase the productivity of your enterprise.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
This is the main conclusion.

09:49.000 --> 10:01.000
You should find ways to increase the volume faster than the costs of production increase.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
If you solve this problem, your enterprise will save on costs.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
And, therefore, the profit will increase more and more.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
The higher the profit, the greater the opportunity for your enterprise to develop.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
This is the practical application of this question.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I would like to draw your attention to the business owners.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Pay attention to this coefficient in your enterprise.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
Calculate it and draw the appropriate conclusion.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
And now we move on to the second question of our topic.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
The second question is about the analysis of the profits.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
This analysis is based on the marginal analysis.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
And the topic of our topic is called the marginal analysis.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
The marginal analysis evaluates the marginal profit, the price coefficient,

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
the points of profitability in the production process, both in terms of money and in terms of natural expression,

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
the reserve of financial strength that exists in the enterprise,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
and the possible cases when it decreases.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
The operation lever is evaluated, what opportunities it gives to the enterprise.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
And at the end we will consider the factors that affect the change of the specified quantities.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
First, what is the marginal profit?

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
The marginal profit is the difference between the revenue from sales and the variable costs.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
The slide you see now shows the formula that shows how the marginal profit is determined.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
It is simply the difference between the revenue and the variable costs.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the category of marginal profit

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
differs from the category of the value-added profit that we discussed in the last lecture.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
These are two different categories.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
They do not coincide and can only be equal in a particular case.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
In a general case, they are different. Why?

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
The value-added profit is the difference between the revenue and the value-added cost.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
And the marginal profit is the difference between the revenue and only the variable costs.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
And we remember, today we were discussing this issue,

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
and we were told that the enterprise has two types of costs, variable and constant.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
But the marginal profit does not take into account the constant costs.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
This is a completely different category and is used for a completely different analysis.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
I would like to draw your attention to this so that you do not get confused.

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
Why is the marginal profit necessary? Why is this category introduced?

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
The marginal profit serves as a basis for determining the surplus volume of sales.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
And for an enterprise, for each type of product, such a marginal profit can be calculated,

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
as well as in general for an enterprise, and to justify the appropriate management decisions

13:36.000 --> 13:44.000
that allow to get the maximum profit, to get the largest volume of profit.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Now I would like to draw your attention to the next chart.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
I hope you will watch it for a long time while I comment on it.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
This is the most important chart of our lecture today.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Pay attention.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
On this chart you see two important intersecting curves.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
One curve is the revenue curve.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
It is proportional to the volume of production.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
We believe that the price of a product is constant,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
and the more the product is sold, the more the revenue is.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
It is proportional to the volume of production.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
The second curve is the full cost.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
The full cost consists of two components.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
It consists of variable costs and constant costs.

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
You see that the full cost is shown as the sum of constant and variable costs.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
The difference between the revenue and the variable costs is the marginal profit.

14:50.000 --> 14:59.000
The graph shows the marginal profit, and we can see its magnitude.

14:59.000 --> 15:09.000
The most important point of this graph is the intersection of the revenue and the full cost.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
The point where the intersection of these two curves occurs is called the lossless point.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
This point has a special name.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
Look at what happens during production.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
When the production is less than the lossless point,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
we have the following situation.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
The cost of the product is higher than the revenue.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
The full cost is higher than the revenue.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
The enterprise is paid more than the production.

15:56.000 --> 16:04.000
The simplest example is a huge factory that produces ballpoint pens.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
The first ballpoint pen was produced at this huge factory.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
The cost of production is much higher than the revenue.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
This is the point we are going to discuss.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
When the production is small, it is because the enterprise is starting to work.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Or it is because the enterprise is not producing enough.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
The cost is not the same.

16:42.000 --> 16:51.000
The cost is higher than the revenue.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
If the cost is higher than the revenue,

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
what is the enterprise's profit or loss?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
The enterprise is losing money.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
The cost is higher than the revenue.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
The left side of the graph shows the loss area.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
The enterprise is losing money while working in this area.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
The enterprise is losing money.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
The enterprise is losing money while working in this area.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
Of course, the loss will be the same when the first ballpoint pen is produced.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
Of course, the enterprise will lose money.

17:36.000 --> 17:44.000
The enterprise will have to work while the production is increasing.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
When the production is increasing,

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
the revenue increases because the production is increasing.

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
Finally, the revenue is equal to the total costs.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
In this case, the difference between the revenue and the costs is zero.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
The enterprise compensated all the costs.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Yes, there is no profit.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
But this is the first victory.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
You can shout hurray and drink champagne.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
The enterprise is working in a way that it can't afford to lose money.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
All the new enterprises are going through this point.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
This is the most joyful point.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
The most anxious expectations and thoughts are coming to the enterprise.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
The enterprise should leave the loss area as soon as possible.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Finally, we left the loss area.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
This is why this point is called the point of no loss.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Finally, there is no loss.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Now, we should pay attention to the right side of the graph.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
The right side is the point of no loss.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Pay attention.

19:17.000 --> 19:25.000
The direct revenue is higher than the direct total costs.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
What does it mean?

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
It means that the revenue is higher than the costs.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
If the revenue is higher than the costs, the enterprise gets a profit.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
Finally, the enterprise gets a profit.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Pay attention.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
The further we leave the point of no loss,

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
the difference between the revenue and the total costs becomes bigger and bigger.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
The curves diverge.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
What does it mean?

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
The enterprise gets more and more profits.

20:07.000 --> 20:18.000
The first conclusion we can draw from this graph is that the enterprise needs to increase the production volume to reach the point of no loss.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
This is the minimum program.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Without this, the enterprise cannot function for a long time.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
It will stop and cease to exist.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
This is why we must reach this point.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
This is the minimum program.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
The number one program.

20:36.000 --> 20:47.000
The second task of the enterprise after reaching the point of no loss is to increase the production volume as much as possible.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
To move away from the point of no loss.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
The further the enterprise moves away from the point of no loss,

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
the more products it produces, the more profits it gets.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
We will talk about this today.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
We will discuss this graph later.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
We will discuss how far we can go from the point of no loss.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
We will discuss whether there are other effects.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
We will discuss this later.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
For now, we are making the most important conclusion.

21:22.000 --> 21:29.000
The enterprise should work with a production volume greater than the point of no loss.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
We have seen the marginal profit on this graph.

21:34.000 --> 21:41.000
I will define the marginal profit as the difference between the revenue and the variable costs.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
It is important to calculate the marginal profit on the enterprise.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
The growth of the marginal profit positively characterizes the dynamics of the enterprise.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
If the enterprise has a marginal profit, it has a prospect for development.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
The enterprise can expand due to the profit.

22:01.000 --> 22:09.000
It can increase the social needs of the employees of the enterprise.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
It can also increase the income of the owners of the enterprise.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
All this is decided by the profit.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
An important coefficient that characterizes the marginal profit is the price coefficient.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
The price coefficient is another name for the marginal profit.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
The higher the price coefficient, the better the enterprise works.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
The price coefficient is determined by the marginal profit.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
The price coefficient is determined by the following factors that affect it.

22:49.000 --> 23:03.000
The higher the price of the product, the higher the revenue, the greater the marginal profit.

23:03.000 --> 23:12.000
The marginal profit is only connected with the variable costs.

23:12.000 --> 23:21.000
If the revenue is higher and the variable costs are the same, the price will increase along with the marginal profit.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
The price coefficient is connected with the prices of the variable costs.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
But it is inversely proportional.

23:31.000 --> 23:40.000
If the prices of the variable costs increase, the marginal profit decreases.

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
Therefore, any enterprise should ensure that it sells the product in the best possible way,

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
and that it receives the most revenue from the sale of the product.

23:52.000 --> 24:02.000
At the same time, it should ensure that the enterprise's costs do not increase so rapidly and that the revenue is not eaten up.

24:02.000 --> 24:09.000
As we have already said, the most ideal scenario is a degressive increase in the variable costs,

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
when the revenue increases faster than the costs.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
The price coefficient and the product's nomenclature affect it.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
In other words, what do you produce?

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
The thing is that if a company produces a lot of different types of products,

24:31.000 --> 24:43.000
each of them has its own marginal profit and contributes to the total marginal profit of the company.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Each product has a different marginal profit,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
so one product is more profitable and the other is less profitable.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Therefore, by changing the structure of the produced product,

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
you can change the total marginal profit of the enterprise.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
It should be noted here, and, therefore,

25:06.000 --> 25:14.000
we should try to produce more of the product that gives more marginal profit.

25:15.000 --> 25:22.000
Naturally, if the market accepts this product, if you can realize it,

25:22.000 --> 25:30.000
if the market's ability to purchase a product is much greater than your ability to produce it,

25:30.000 --> 25:41.000
then you should boldly reorient the structure of your production to the production of the product that gives more marginal profit.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
This is a very important point.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
It turns out that the structure of the produced product is not random.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
And it is not only determined by the market, not only by what is in demand,

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
but the structure also affects what kind of profit you will get.

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
Will you be a profitable enterprise, a highly profitable enterprise, or only a little bit profitable?

26:04.000 --> 26:12.000
Therefore, dear owners, you can stop listening to this lecture again.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
Take a pencil in your hand and carefully study the structure of your produced product,

26:19.000 --> 26:29.000
inviting economists and financiers to see what kind of marginal profit each of your produced products brings.

26:30.000 --> 26:41.000
And together with the market experts, consider whether it is possible to increase the volume of the product that brings the greatest marginal profit.

26:41.000 --> 26:50.000
If your market experts agree to produce more of this product, you can boldly reorient the production process.

26:51.000 --> 27:02.000
You can increase the production volume of one particular product and reduce the volume of another product that does not bring you the profit that the enterprise needs.

27:04.000 --> 27:12.000
Along with the change in the structure of production, the change in the technology of production also affects the amount of marginal profit.

27:13.000 --> 27:21.000
Technology is equipment, technological processes, and, in the end, the qualification of the workers involved in this process.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
In other words, it is all that affects the costs of production.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Technology can have a double effect.

27:31.000 --> 27:40.000
It can change the amount of variable costs, they can decrease, and this is a positive phenomenon,

27:40.000 --> 27:49.000
because if the variable costs decrease, we have a degressive growth of production, which we only dreamed of,

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
when the variable costs grow slower than the production volume.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
Such a change in the technology of production should only be welcomed.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
This is the best, the most ideal option.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
But this is not the only option.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
You can change the technology and increase the constant costs.

28:13.000 --> 28:23.000
Increasing the constant costs does not mean that your profit will increase.

28:23.000 --> 28:30.000
The thing is that increasing the constant costs causes increasing the cost of production.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
At the same price, which you will implement, this leads to a decrease in profit.

28:35.000 --> 28:46.000
But equipment with a higher price can be more durable.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
It can produce more products.

28:49.000 --> 28:57.000
In this case, it will be more effective than cheaper equipment, which serves a very short time.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
Therefore, if you change the technology and the constant costs change,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
this requires further study.

29:07.000 --> 29:15.000
It is impossible to answer whether the marginal profit will improve.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
The short-term marginal profit may decrease,

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
and the total marginal profit for the entire service life of equipment may be greater.

29:25.000 --> 29:32.000
It is very important to pay attention to the goal of the owner of the enterprise.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
Do you want to get the maximum profit in one day?

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
Or do you want to get the maximum profit for the entire service life of your enterprise?

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
What is the goal of your business?

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
Based on this, you can build up the costs of changing the technology.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
The point of non-profitability, which characterizes the production process,

29:57.000 --> 30:03.000
and which is very important for us, as we have just seen, can be calculated accurately.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
There are formulas for this, which you can see on the screen.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
The point of non-profitability in a natural way means the amount of products

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
that the enterprise must produce in order to be not in loss,

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
in order to be able to say that the revenue and the costs coincided.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Yes, the profit is zero, but it is not a loss.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
So, the point of non-profitability in the quantitative expression is equal to

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
the fraction in the numerator of the production of the constant costs per unit of the product,

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
multiplied by the number of produced products, and in the denominator the marginal profit.

30:44.000 --> 30:52.000
Thus, the amount of products that must be produced in order to be not in loss is determined.

30:52.000 --> 31:00.000
You can stop the lecture once again and ask your economist,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
how many products do you produce?

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
Now you know how many of them must be produced in order to be not in loss.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
The same formula is only in the constant expression.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
That is, in the monetary expression, not in the quantity of the products.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Again, look at the screen.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
The point of non-profitability in the quantitative expression is equal to

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
the fraction in the numerator of the production of the constant costs per unit,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
multiplied by the revenue, and divided by the marginal profit.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that these formulas are fair

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
only for a company that produces one type of product.

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
If there are many types of products at a company, the formula becomes somewhat complicated.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Although the logic remains the same.

31:50.000 --> 31:57.000
You just need to consider several types of products, sum them up,

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
and consider the point of non-profitability in relation to each of the types of produced products.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
After we have studied the point of non-profitability,

32:09.000 --> 32:17.000
I would like to emphasize that everything we are discussing today is not just a theory.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
This is a practice that must be tested.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
It is necessary to look at how the production is in your company.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
How much do you produce?

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
How far have you moved away from the point of non-profitability?

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Or maybe you haven't even approached it yet?

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
Depending on where you are in relation to the point of non-profitability

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
and where you are moving towards the point of non-profitability or away from it,

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
the management decisions depend on it.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
The management decisions will be completely different

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
depending on where you are in relation to the point of non-profitability.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
If you are on the right side of the point of non-profitability,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
and the volume of your products is increasing, you should be happy.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
You can have a holiday at the company.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
This means that your marginal profit is growing,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
and things are going well at the company.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
If you are on the right side of the point of non-profitability,

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
but the dynamics of production is such that the volume of products is decreasing,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
and you are moving to the point of non-profitability on the right,

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
this is a disturbing symptom.

33:34.000 --> 33:40.000
Now we will look at another practical application of the material we have just discussed.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
So, we say that the more to the right we are from the point of non-profitability,

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
the better our enterprise is doing economically.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
What does it mean?

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
It means that the company has a reserve of financial strength.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
It has more and more profit, which it receives.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
And, accordingly, if it receives as much profit as possible,

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
then its financial strength increases.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
The reserve of financial strength shows how much percentage

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
the volume of the implementation can be reduced or increased

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
to maintain or achieve the surplus level of work.

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
The reserve of financial strength is very important for the enterprise.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
The enterprise should feel confident in business,

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
so the reserve of financial strength should be as much as possible.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
The reserve of financial strength is mathematically defined

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
as the absolute deviation from the point of non-profitability to the profit.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
We should look at how far our production volume

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
exceeds the volume at which there is a point of non-profitability,

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
and divide this excess into the profit that the enterprise has.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
This is the reserve of financial strength.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
The higher the reserve of financial strength,

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
the better the enterprise is doing.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
Again, we should calculate the reserve of financial strength.

35:25.000 --> 35:33.000
And it is even better to ask to calculate it for equal periods of time.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
For example, once a quarter, when the financial report is submitted,

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
we should calculate the reserve of financial strength for the economists

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
to compare and see how the dynamics of the enterprise's financial strength changes.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
If it increases, it is great.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
It means that your enterprise feels good,

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
and soon it will feel great.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
This is a reason to rejoice.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
If the reserve of financial strength decreases,

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
it is a warning bell.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
We should pay attention to this.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
We should look at why the reserve of financial strength decreases.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Why?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Because the decrease of the reserve of financial strength

36:19.000 --> 36:26.000
means that the enterprise will feel more and more uncomfortable in the market.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
Once again, the higher the reserve of financial strength,

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
the more stable the enterprise is.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
Moreover, the reserve of financial strength allows us to compare different enterprises.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
We can say which enterprise is more stable in the market, which is less stable.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
Stability also depends on the life of the enterprise in the market.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
The more stable it is, the more guarantees it has that it will exist longer and more successfully.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
Moreover, the reserve of financial strength is like the height of a boat.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
When it is still, the height of the boat does not matter.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
But when the waves are increasing,

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
the boat with a small boat will soon sink and sink.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
And the boat with a high boat will be more stable

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
and will be able to overcome all the obstacles that arose before it.

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
Therefore, once again, study how the reserve of financial strength of your enterprise changes.

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
And do everything possible to ensure that the reserve of financial strength does not decrease,

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
but rather increases and increases.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
We have already discussed that when an enterprise goes through a point of profitability

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
and starts producing more and more products,

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
its profit starts to increase, increase, increase.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
And this is just great, we should be happy about it.

38:09.000 --> 38:19.000
But then we noted that such a state does not always take place.

38:19.000 --> 38:27.000
The fact is that if we look at what will happen with a very strong increase in the volume of production,

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
we will face geometrically opposite pictures.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
Look carefully at the graph that is now in front of you.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
The area that we have just studied is located in the circle.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Remember the intersection of two straight lines?

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
Profit and total costs.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
What we have studied is only related to this small circle.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
And inside this circle, everything is fair.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
But look at what is changing outside this circle.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
How much the picture changes.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
Everything that happens outside the circle does not coincide with what happens inside the circle.

39:10.000 --> 39:16.000
Everything that we have just studied is related to overcoming the point of profitability.

39:16.000 --> 39:22.000
We have just crossed it and are starting to live better, better, better, to produce more.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
Everything is great, but it is close to the point of profitability.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
And what is waiting for us next?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
We will develop our enterprise.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
The enterprise will produce more and more and more products.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Look, we are moving along the X axis.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
We are increasing the volume of production.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
The profit curve is significantly superior to the cost curve.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
And we see that the further we move along the X axis,

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
the difference between the profit and the total costs becomes more and more and more.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
See?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Great.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
The profit is increasing, increasing, increasing.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
But it cannot increase infinitely.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And that is why.

40:09.000 --> 40:19.000
The thing is that if we increase any of the production factors,

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
the benefit we get from increasing this production factor will increase.

40:27.000 --> 40:39.000
But the increase in the benefit we will get from increasing this factor will increase on a smaller scale.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
That is, it will decrease all the time.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
The simplest example.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
In a hot afternoon, you really want to drink.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
You drink a glass of mineral water.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Very good.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
You completely quench your thirst.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
But if you pour the same second glass of mineral water in the same way,

41:04.000 --> 41:10.000
the benefit from its consumption will be less than the benefit from the first glass of water.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
And if you drink the third, fourth, fifth glass of water at once,

41:14.000 --> 41:27.000
the benefits of each glass of water will decrease until it becomes zero.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
And if you drink water even further,

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
you will get even negative results, negative benefits.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
And this is good for almost everything.

41:38.000 --> 41:46.000
Consumption of any benefit, the more we consume it, the more useful it becomes.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
But the increase in the benefit decreases, decreases, and decreases until it becomes zero.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
There are only two benefits.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
They are considered to be insatiable thirst for power and money.

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
And both seem to be even better.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
All other benefits are insatiable.

42:13.000 --> 42:25.000
And the increase in the benefit consumption always leads to the moment when further benefit consumption becomes indifferent and even harmful.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
We have the same thing in production.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
You can imagine several options for changing the production situation.

42:37.000 --> 42:47.000
For example, we change the equipment, improve the equipment, improve the main funds.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
We leave the rest unchanged, untouched.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
Imagine, our enterprise worked only in one shift, produced a certain amount of products.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
We change the equipment.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
We have now put more perfect equipment.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
We don't over-train the workers, we decided that we don't change anything else.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
More perfect equipment.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
Yes, more perfect equipment is more effective, it allows us to produce more products.

43:15.000 --> 43:22.000
But until our workers, whom we don't over-train, are able to work with this equipment.

43:22.000 --> 43:31.000
If we continue to change the equipment, put the most perfect machines with numerical software, which requires a very high qualification of the workers,

43:31.000 --> 43:37.000
then we will see that our workers cannot work on these machines without the appropriate increase in skill.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
They will stop and production will freeze.

43:42.000 --> 43:48.000
It would seem that we have put the most perfect machines, it is impossible to invent better.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
We cannot even produce a single product.

43:51.000 --> 44:05.000
It turns out that increasing one factor of production and investing in one factor of production not only contributes to growth,

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
but from some point on it can stop production.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
This is typical for other factors of production.

44:13.000 --> 44:20.000
Let's increase the number of workers, and leave the equipment the same.

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
For example, an enterprise that worked in one shift will be transferred to work in two shifts.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
We will increase the number of workers at the enterprise.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
From the point of view of the enterprise, this is great.

44:34.000 --> 44:43.000
Working in two shifts is very effective for the enterprise, because it allows two shifts of workers to work on the same equipment.

44:43.000 --> 44:51.000
Accordingly, the constant costs are the same, and the volume of products increases almost double.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
Therefore, we increase the profit that the enterprise receives.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
It is just great.

44:58.000 --> 45:05.000
The transition from one shift to two shifts is a very good solution for any production enterprise.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
Now let's try to continue this line.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Let's start working in three shifts.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
From the point of view of equipment use, this is a positive phenomenon,

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
because the same equipment works within one day, during three shifts.

45:22.000 --> 45:32.000
However, working in a third shift is always less effective than working in a first and second shift.

45:32.000 --> 45:41.000
The workers who work in the third shift at the enterprise, no matter how hard they try to work well,

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
nevertheless, the body requires rest at night, physiologically.

45:48.000 --> 45:58.000
And a worker at night is not as active as he is at day time.

45:58.000 --> 46:06.000
His movements are slower, his mental abilities are even slower.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
Yes, a person works, but the return from him to the third shift is much less,

46:13.000 --> 46:20.000
because deep in the subconscious, a person sleeps, rests at night.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
This is how the human body works, he should rest at night.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
This is how nature has built a human life for millions of years.

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
Therefore, in the third shift we always have a lower productivity of labor.

46:36.000 --> 46:43.000
Moreover, a worker in the third shift needs to rest more, to take more breaks.

46:43.000 --> 46:49.000
Moreover, it should be noted that there are always fewer people who want to work in the third shift

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
than those who want to work in the first and second shifts.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
And if there are fewer people who want to work, then to attract them to work,

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
workers in the third shift need to pay more wages.

47:03.000 --> 47:11.000
We see that there is less production, and the pay in the third shift is higher.

47:11.000 --> 47:18.000
Therefore, the economic efficiency of the enterprise in the third shift is lower than in the first shift.

47:18.000 --> 47:29.000
Thus, wanting to improve the situation, we go from one shift to two, and see significant improvements,

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
and we go to work in the third shift and see a slowdown.

47:34.000 --> 47:40.000
The third shift does not give the same growth as, for example, the second shift.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
The third shift is less effective.

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
Let's not increase the number of workers, let's increase their qualifications.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
Let's approach this issue from the third side.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
We have the simplest equipment that workers use.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
And the workers cope with it perfectly.

48:02.000 --> 48:09.000
Let's not change the equipment, the simplest thing, let's start to increase the qualifications.

48:09.000 --> 48:17.000
Instead of unqualified workers, let's take workers from the technical school qualification.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
These workers are more qualified, they have theory and practice,

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
they have better skills than unqualified workers who just came from the street,

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
who have been entrusted with equipment, and who can harm this equipment more than use it.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
And qualified workers are a completely different matter.

48:39.000 --> 48:45.000
Therefore, the increase in the qualification of the work used instead of unqualified workers,

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
there is a positive phenomenon.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
That's why enterprises always look for workers of higher qualifications.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
But we continue to move in this direction.

48:57.000 --> 49:07.000
And instead of qualified workers, we will take and offer this job to a qualified worker with a higher education.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
And here we have the first call.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
On the one hand, a qualified worker with a higher education has theory.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
If he studied well and listened to the lectures we are listening to now.

49:21.000 --> 49:29.000
He has higher knowledge than a worker, even a qualified one, I mean theoretical knowledge.

49:29.000 --> 49:42.000
But a worker of a higher education has more emphasis on theoretical knowledge than on practical knowledge.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
Unlike a worker who graduated from a technical school.

49:46.000 --> 49:53.000
And that's why this worker has theoretical knowledge, but to a lesser extent he has practical skills.

49:53.000 --> 50:03.000
That's why when graduates of the universities come and start working for the first time in their lives at enterprises,

50:03.000 --> 50:12.000
they have to study a lot, to learn, to gain those skills of practical experience that no institute can give them.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
But that's not the task of the institute.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
The task of the institute is to give theoretical skills, first of all.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
Well, and practical skills, but still, first of all, theoretical skills.

50:22.000 --> 50:28.000
And if we start to raise our level further, and instead of workers who have just graduated from the institute,

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
we'll start to invite people who have a very high theoretical education.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
Candidates to science, PhD students, academics.

50:36.000 --> 50:43.000
We'll invite them to work and say, here's a hammer, here's a chisel, dear academics, let's work.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
What will be our return?

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
Do you think our efficiency will increase from such work or decrease?

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
Yes, dear academics have a huge amount of knowledge.

50:57.000 --> 51:06.000
But, to be honest, there are probably some academics who have held a chisel and hammer only in their childhood.

51:06.000 --> 51:15.000
And to say that they can do a great job of work that a worker should do, you can doubt that.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
But that's not all.

51:18.000 --> 51:28.000
The salary of the academics is, of course, higher than that of those who don't have such a high scientific qualification.

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
Consequently, fewer skills in work and higher salary.

51:34.000 --> 51:41.000
Thus, we see that further increase in the qualification of a worker leads to a decrease in the efficiency of its use.

51:42.000 --> 51:49.000
Any factor of production that we don't take, if we increase it,

51:49.000 --> 51:56.000
only this factor increases, it leads to a decrease in the efficiency of production.

51:56.000 --> 52:04.000
At first it grows, then the growth stops, and then there's a decrease. Always.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
What should be done to prevent this from happening?

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
The answer is simple.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Change the factors in a complex way.

52:14.000 --> 52:20.000
If we increase the qualification of a worker, then we change the equipment together with him.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
Or vice versa, if we increase the equipment, we put a better one, we increase the qualification of the worker.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
If we put the machines with numerical software instead of the usual machines,

52:31.000 --> 52:37.000
then the workers who should work for these machines should have a higher qualification.

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
Then the equipment and the workers will correspond to each other.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
And the production will grow and not decrease.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
But this is regarding the use of equipment and workers.

52:53.000 --> 53:01.000
As for, for example, the work in the third shift, here, unfortunately, we will get a decrease anyway.

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
Because it's impossible to make a person who would live only in the night,

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
he needs to completely rebuild himself and live only in the night,

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
which is unlikely to be interesting for the workers themselves.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
After all, a person is a daily being.

53:21.000 --> 53:30.000
Thus, we have seen that the change of production factors in enterprises is rather ambiguous.

53:30.000 --> 53:36.000
It's impossible to say that if we improve the production factor, then we will have a cloudless life in the future.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
No, it's a very subtle question.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
Here, it's possible to improve the production factor.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
It's certainly so.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
We need to look at how the costs are increasing.

53:49.000 --> 53:55.000
If the volume of production grows faster than the costs,

53:55.000 --> 54:06.000
that is, the growth of the production volume in the unit of production grows faster than the growth of the costs in the unit of production,

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
then we have a positive phenomenon in the economy.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
We have an increase in the profits for the enterprise.

54:15.000 --> 54:23.000
But if the growth of the revenue volume grows slower than the growth of the costs,

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
then we have a reverse picture.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
The costs grow faster than the revenue volume, and the profit value decreases.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
This is exactly what the graph you see in front of you is reflecting.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Now, pay attention to this graph.

54:39.000 --> 54:46.000
We are already moving away from what is depicted in the left part and moving to the middle of this graph.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Look carefully.

54:47.000 --> 54:55.000
If an enterprise produces a product equal to x2, then we have the largest maximum profit.

54:55.000 --> 55:04.000
It is at this point that the revenue in relation to costs, the difference between revenue and costs, is the highest.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
This is the ideal point for production.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
Any businessman should know this point for his enterprise.

55:15.000 --> 55:23.000
This is the point of production where the maximum profit in relation to the unit of production is the highest.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
This is a very important point.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
The thing is that if we work to the left or to the right of this point,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
that is, we will produce more or less products,

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
we will get less profit in relation to the unit of production.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
We will work to the left.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
Yes, the enterprise will work at full capacity, but there will be no profit.

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
And it is at this point that the profit from the unit of production is the highest.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
This is the point that we need to find.

55:51.000 --> 55:59.000
Therefore, it is high time to stop listening to lectures, call an economist and give him a task.

55:59.000 --> 56:07.000
Find out the point at which the maximum profit will be produced at the enterprise.

56:07.000 --> 56:14.000
And then compare the real point at which your enterprise is located with this point of maximum profit.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Look where you are.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
To the left or to the right?

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
How far are you from the point of maximum profit?

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
The thing is that if you are to the left, you need to increase the volume of production.

56:27.000 --> 56:33.000
And then you will reach the level where you will get the maximum profit per unit of production.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Attention!

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
There is a very important point here.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
You should not only produce the product, but also sell it.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
Otherwise, it will be in your warehouse and will cause even more harm than if you did not produce this product.

56:49.000 --> 56:55.000
Therefore, before making a decision that you need to increase the volume of production,

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
you need to invite a marketologist and give him a task.

57:00.000 --> 57:07.000
Find out whether we can implement a larger volume of production of our product on the market.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Will the market accept this product?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
This is a very serious question.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
There are other competitors on the market who produce this product.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
This is an important question.

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
If the marketologist answers that the market will accept this product, the market is not saturated,

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
you can boldly set the task to increase the volume of production and increase production to the value of X2,

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
to the point where the maximum profit per unit of production is.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
You can boldly follow this path.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
This is the right path to the development of the enterprise.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
And if the marketologist says no,

57:48.000 --> 57:54.000
unfortunately, we are already producing the maximum amount of products that the market can accept.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
This is a completely different question.

57:58.000 --> 58:06.000
This means that further increase in the number of produced products is not feasible.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Otherwise, the product will be all in the warehouse.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
Yes, the profit per unit of production is less,

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
but this is the maximum that can be achieved in these conditions.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Here you need to look at the question more broadly.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
Can we increase the volume of production if we reduce the price?

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
This will be the second task for the marketologist.

58:31.000 --> 58:36.000
The fact is that the reduction of the price leads to a reduction in profit,

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
but the movement to the point X2 leads to an increase in profit.

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
What is more, will the profit be reduced from the reduction of the price,

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
or will the profit be increased due to the increase in the volume of production?

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
Here you need to compare, you need to look carefully.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
If we get more profit from increasing the volume of production,

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
and if we give part of it to the consumer due to the reduction of the price,

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
then this is the right way to move to the enterprise.

59:06.000 --> 59:12.000
But if during the calculation it turns out that the volume of production,

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
which characterizes your enterprise, is to the right of the point X2,

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
the maximum profit per unit of production,

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
then the situation is diametrically opposite.

59:24.000 --> 59:31.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that here you cannot increase the volume of production.

59:31.000 --> 59:37.000
It would seem logical that the more you produce, the better,

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
but in fact this is not the case at all.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
I would even say that this is absolutely not the case.

59:43.000 --> 59:50.000
The fact is that the amount of profit per unit of production is reduced.

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
Therefore, if you are to the right of the point of the maximum profit per unit of production,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.000
then you have two options.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Now we will talk about them in the story.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
The first option is seen on the graph.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
This is, of course, to shift to the left to the point X2,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
that is, to reduce the volume of production.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
No matter how paradoxical it may seem,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
you need to reduce the volume of production to get profit,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
rather than increase the volume of production so as not to get this profit.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
After all, if we shift further, for example, to the point X3 on the graph,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
it would seem that we have increased the volume of production,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
we have become so good, but the profit is zero.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
The meaning of our existence is zero.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000
In this case, of course, shifting to the left to the point X2,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
where the maximum profit per unit of production is reduced, is more logical.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
You will say, but we want to increase the volume of production,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
we want to expand our enterprise.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
How can we do this? Why can't we increase the volume of production?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Well, why can't we increase the volume of production at this enterprise is already clear,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
but how to increase the volume of production in general is a separate conversation.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The fact is that what we are talking about

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
characterizes this plant or this workshop or this site for the production of products.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000
But if there is a second such plant or site next to it,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
also tuned for the optimal volume of production,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
then in total they will produce twice as much production.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
At the same time, each of these sites will be tuned for the optimal regime.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
This is a very important point.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
By printing the optimal regimes,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
the second site, the third, the fourth, the fifth,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
spreading them all over the country, all over the globe.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Pay attention to how McDonald's works.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
McDonald's has not created the only one establishment

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
from which Big Macs are brought all over the globe.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:20.000
No. McDonald's creates points similar to each other all over the globe.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
As a result, each point is tuned for the optimal regime

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
and in total they give a huge amount of products

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
in the optimal regime in terms of profit.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
This is much better than if there was only one McDonald's

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
for the whole globe.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
The same is true here.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
If we have found the optimal production regime for our enterprise,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
then the next step is to copy this production.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Remember the example of McDonald's and decide to move in this direction.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Build a second workshop next to it, a third workshop, a fourth workshop.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
You can build them next to each other.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You can open branches in other cities.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
These are all issues of the same order.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
The most important thing is that each production site

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
will be optimally tuned and will bring you the maximum profit

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
per unit of the produced product.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
This is a very important point.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
This regime has its own name.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It is called the American business regime.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
It is believed that all American enterprises work in the regime

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
of the maximum profit per unit of production.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But this is not the only regime.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
As I told you today that you can move from the point to the right of X2

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
in two different directions,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I meant that there is another possible direction of movement.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
If we are interested in profit,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
we are interested in its absolute maximum amount.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
What happens in this case?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
The absolute amount of profit is the product of the profit per unit of production

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
multiplied by the number of produced products.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Is this question clear?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The conclusion is that the maximum amount of profit

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
can be obtained by the optimal combination of these two quantities,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
the profit per unit of production and the number of produced products.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You can not have the maximum profit per unit of production,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
but have such a large number of products

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000
that their products will give the largest amount of profit.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
This regime was called the Japanese regime.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It is assumed that Japanese enterprises work in this regime.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
They get the maximum profit,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
but the profit per unit of production is not the maximum.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
The work in this regime means the production of a huge amount of products.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Yes, the profit per unit of production is reduced.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Look, this point, which characterizes the Japanese production process,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
is to the right of X2 on our graph.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Yes, the profit per unit of production will be 10% less.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And the production volume will be 50% more.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The production of these two quantities will give more than we had in X2.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That is, working in this second regime, the Japanese production regime,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
gives the maximum profit for the enterprise.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Yes, the profit per unit of production is very small.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
But the value of this profit is huge.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
It is the maximum amount of products that can be obtained at this enterprise.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
If you work in the first regime,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
you need to distribute these products to the workshops,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
to the plots, all over the country, all over the globe.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Working in the second regime does not mean that you will be distributed.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It means that the maximum profit will be taken from this enterprise.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
The profit that can be obtained at this enterprise.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Maybe it is a transition to two shifts.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Maybe it is some other technical solution.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
But the maximum profit will be the total profit of this enterprise.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000
There is a version of why these two regimes of work appeared.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Some countries work in one regime, and some countries work in another regime.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
This version states the following.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
The regime that is called the American regime,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
that is, the maximum profit per unit of production,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
is more characteristic for those countries where the territory allows to build new factories.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
There is no problem with the land.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
You can build many factories.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
The country is huge, there is a lot of space.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You can easily build new buildings, new workshops.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And vice versa.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
In small countries, where each piece of land is worth gold,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
where it is very difficult to build another workshop, another factory,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
there they try to make the maximum profit from the factory that has already been built.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Japan is the best example of this.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Look at the map.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Compare Russia with Japan in terms of territory.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
They are incomparable.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Now imagine that Japan has almost the same population as Russia.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
This small country on the map has almost the same population as Russia.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Not to mention that the production volume in Japan is colossal.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
The land in Japan is worth gold.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Maybe that's why the way to make the maximum profit from the factory,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
from the enterprise, from the land where the products are produced, is very difficult.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
This regime is characterized by the production of a huge amount of products.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
If in the first regime, when the maximum profit is one unit,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
you don't need to produce a lot of products,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
you need to produce the optimal amount of them,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
then in the second regime you need to produce the maximum amount of products.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That's why Japan is famous for the huge amount of produced products.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
With such a huge amount, it is inevitable to develop the foreign market,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
with export to all countries of the world,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
because this is inevitable in this regime of work.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
We have compared two regimes.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It is appropriate to ask now,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
which regime of work do our Russian enterprises work in?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
As an owner of an enterprise,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
who is listening to this lecture now,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
think and answer yourself the question,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
which regime of work is more suitable for us, Russian businessmen,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
the American or the Japanese?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
What are we striving for?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
To get the maximum profit from a single produced product

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
or to get the maximum profit from an enterprise?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
When I asked this question to other listeners at my lectures,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
to the owners of enterprises,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
who were listening to these lectures,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
they all answered me in one voice,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
that the American path is closer to them.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
They say that every Russian enterprise is set up

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
to get the maximum profit from a single produced product.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
But then I ask them the following question,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
if this path is closer to us,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
please tell me, do you market this production?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And they answer, no.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Unfortunately, in our country,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000
the issue of marketing production is not so simple.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It is not so easy for our businessmen

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
to open many branches all over the country.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
It is a difficult issue.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Probably, in the USA it is easier to solve

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
if this method has received a similar name

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and is more difficult for this country.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I would like for our business to be easier to develop branches,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
to create enterprises all over the country,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
since our business is also struggling to get the maximum profit from a single produced product.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Then we will get the maximum profit from a single produced product

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and the maximum profit from a single produced product

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
that is widespread, concentrated,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
closer to the consumer in all corners of the country and the world.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
This is a very important point.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
This is a very important point.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And before we move on,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
you should think again about how your enterprise works,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
what production mode is more optimal for your enterprise.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
If you can market your products,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
open a new branch, a new plot,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000
then the way to get the maximum profit from a single produced product is more acceptable.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But if you cannot do this for one reason or another,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
lack of capital,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
inability to get permission to build a new enterprise,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
then the way is more Japanese.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Then you should try to get the maximum profit from this enterprise.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
But you should not forget once again

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
that as soon as we move along the way of increasing production volume,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
we should agree on this issue with marketologists.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Will we be able to implement this product?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
If we increase production volume in several times,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
it is not a fact that we can easily implement this product.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
It is not a coincidence that these enterprises are concentrated all over the country,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
that is, they are closer to the consumers.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Because to import a product from one point to all corners of the globe

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
is less effective than if production is concentrated all over the globe.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Remember McDonald's.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Imagine a McDonald's point

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
with Big Macs all over the globe.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You come in, order a meal, and wait for Big Macs to be delivered to you from the USA.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
And you do not leave the cafe until it is delivered to you.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
This is what the right production regime means.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
To concentrate production or to produce at one point.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
To produce the maximum profit from a single product

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000
or to produce the maximum profit from the whole enterprise.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Each of you, businessmen,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
current businessmen or those who are going to become businessmen,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
because if you are studying MBA,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
it means that you are ready to advance in business.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It is possible that in the future

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
each of you will become an owner of an enterprise,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
who will manage the enterprise.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And you need to solve this issue for yourself.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
How will your enterprise develop?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Where is the strategic line of development of your enterprise?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
What do you want to get from your enterprise in terms of economy?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
These are the most important questions.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And this graph that you see on the screen now,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
you should remember it very carefully for the rest of your life.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And subconsciously, always increasing or decreasing the volume of production,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000
you should remember the consequences of this in terms of profit.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I want to draw your attention to one more point,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
which exists on this graph.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
The point X3.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
We haven't talked about it today.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
In fact, this is also an important point.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000
This is the point where the revenue and costs intersect again.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
The second time they intersect in these two graphs.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Again, the revenue and costs are equal.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
The revenue is decreasing because the production has become inefficient.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Remember, you have moved to the third shift,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
or you have invited academics to work as workers.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
The enterprise has become economically inefficient.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
The revenue has gone down.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
The costs have increased.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
We have started to pay more.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
The volume of production is not growing as fast as the costs are.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
The enterprise becomes economically less efficient.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And the costs are increasing.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And once the costs become equal to the revenue.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Again, the profit becomes equal to zero.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But pay attention to what is even to the right of the X3 point.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
The costs are higher than the revenue.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
What does it mean?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000
It means that the profit of our enterprise has stopped.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And the enterprise is again in the loss zone.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Thus, increasing the volume of production,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
it would seem that by speeding up the enterprise

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
to unbearable cosmic speeds,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
we have again received losses.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
The enterprise produces an immeasurable amount of products

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
and is in the loss zone.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
If the loss in the beginning,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
when our entire plant was produced with just one pen,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
was still understandable,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
and it was clear that if we increase the production,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
if we leave this initial stage,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
everything will be fine.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The loss we have now

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
is a reflection of our incompetence.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Because knowing that increasing the volume of production to infinity

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
will lead us to the loss zone,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
we would not have accelerated or increased this production.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
That's why we study this discipline.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Today you are armed with knowledge.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Today you know that it is impossible

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
to increase the volume of production to infinity.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Because apart from losses,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
you will not get anything else.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It's a mutually sharp razor.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
It would seem that the more production,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
the more honor, glory, profit, and so on.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
But no.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
There comes a moment when the profit is zero,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
loss, and the enterprise is destroyed.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
With a gigantic volume of production,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
it would seem that this is what you can only dream about.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
That's why we study this science.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Why do we study it?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
We try to understand and choose

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
the most optimal operating regime of the enterprise.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
The point X3

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
has different names in economic literature.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It is called the second point of profitability,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
the threshold of profitability.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I would call it a little differently.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Look, the point X1 is a point without loss.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
There was a loss on the left,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
but we moved and became without loss.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Look at the point X3.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
There was a profit on the left,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
but we moved and became without profit.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Therefore, the point X3 is more rational

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
to call it a point without profit.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
If the point X1 is a point without loss,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
then the point X3 is a point without profit.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
We move from the profit zone to the loss zone,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000
moving from left to right along this graph.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Now we have seen and analyzed all the points

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
on this graph.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Now we can look at it from the bird's eye view.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
We can see the entire graph

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and see how the enterprise should work

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
within this entire graph.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
We move from left to right again,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
from zero to increasing quantity.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
At first, production grows,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
but it grows slower than the costs.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
There are constant costs.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
The cost curve does not start from zero.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It starts from a certain value.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Even if the quantity of goods is zero,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
there are costs.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
You need to build a workshop.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
You can not produce anything in this workshop,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
but you need to build it.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
You need to bear the costs for production.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Then these costs start to grow,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
because variable costs appear,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
and production starts.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
But at the same time, the revenue grows.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
The revenue grows more dynamically

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
than the variable costs.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It grows faster.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And finally, the point X1 is a point without loss.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
The profit is zero.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And in this delta of the loss zone,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
we analyze the behavior.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
We say that at this moment,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
the profit starts to increase,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and it is desirable to produce more goods,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
if we cross the point of no loss.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
This was the first question of our lecture,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
when we were considering all this.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And then the amount of profit increases,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and we get to the point X2.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
This is the optimal point for production.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Our Russian business is getting harder.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
All the sociological polls show

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
that it is getting harder to the point X2.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Even if we are not at the point X2,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
and we are not fulfilling the conditions

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
of the production volume,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
the business wants to be at this point.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It is striving for it,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
to get the maximum profit from the production.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
This is due to the fact that,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
on the one hand,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
there are difficulties with the production volume,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
and on the other hand,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
our Russian business does not have enough capital

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
to produce goods.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
If all the businessmen had enough capital,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
our enterprises would be like McDonald's,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
built all over the globe.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
But not all the businessmen have so much capital.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
But this does not prevent each of them

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
from setting up their very first enterprise

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
for the optimal mode of production.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
To get the maximum profit from the production.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
This is the point X2.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
If you have only one enterprise,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
set it up at this point.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Calculate it.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And hold on to it.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Do not go left or right.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Be at this point X2.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
This will be the optimal point for your production.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
A step to the left or right is worse

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
than being at the point X2.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Except if your capital is so great

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
that you can either start to distribute

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
or increase the production volume

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
on the scale of your enterprise.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
That is, to saturate,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
intensify the means of production

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
to get the maximum profit from the production unit.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
So that there is not a single square centimeter

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
where the production process would not go.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
If you can set it up like this,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
then you will go to the mode

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
that is typical for Japanese production.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
You will squeeze the maximum profit

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
from each square meter of the enterprise.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
But this requires certain efforts

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
and, most importantly, a mental approach.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
For this, the Japanese need to appreciate

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
every square meter of their territory,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
their land or their enterprise.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
But in no case do not allow the transition to point X3.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Remember that it exists.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Yes, it is far away.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
It is not close.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Why not close?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Because it does not mean that if you increased

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
the production unit, you got to the point of loss.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
No.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
The inefficiency of production is not so much expressed.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
But nevertheless, it exists.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
It exists, and you need to remember this.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
You need to remember that you cannot

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
increase the production volume to infinity.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
You can't even set such a goal.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
You should always produce the optimal amount.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
But if you want to produce a lot,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
then print, but the production should be optimized.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
This is the analysis of the chart we have discussed.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
This is the most important chart.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Probably, in today's lecture,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
this is the most important chart.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It is very informationally rich.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
It gives a lot of information,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
allows you to develop the strategy of your enterprise,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
to direct the development of your enterprise.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
It requires, first of all, to determine where you are.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And, accordingly, by determining where you are,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
to develop the direction of movement,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
the direction of further development.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
The most important thing is that you should remember

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
that there is an optimum.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
You should find this optimum and be in it.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
And then your business will flourish.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
You will be happy and satisfied.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And you will tell everyone that thanks to the lectures

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
you have learned in MBA,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
you started to run your business even better than before.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
In conclusion, after we have considered

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
its essence, its logic,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.000
we will stop at the formalized side of this issue.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
The fact is that any logical conclusions

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
always lead to the level of practical use.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
At the same time, a mathematical apparatus is used

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:54.000
that allows to formalize this logic.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Thus, in the issue we have just discussed,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
we have studied the obtaining of maximum profit.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
This is possible with a certain combination

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
of production volume, product price,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
and costs for production.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Maximization of profit is the choice of such production volume,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
where the maximum costs for production

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
and the realization of the product

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
are equal to the maximum profit.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
What is the maximum profit?

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
It is the increase of revenue per unit

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
of the increase of the number of produced products.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:43.000
The production revenue per number of produced products.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
The maximum costs are equal to the increase of costs

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
per unit of the increase of the number of produced products.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
This is also production.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Thus, going back, we can say that

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
the maximization of profit is the production volume

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
where the production revenue and the maximum costs

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
are equal to each other.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That is, neither the income nor the costs

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
grow faster than each other, but are equal.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
When they are equal,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
the maximization of the profit

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000
obtained by the enterprise is achieved.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
The enterprise must expand the production volume

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
until the maximum income is higher than the maximum costs.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:43.000
That is, until the income grows faster than the costs.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And vice versa, stop any expansion

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
as soon as the maximum costs grow faster than the maximum income.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
We have already said that there is an optimal production volume

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
with the maximum profit.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:03.000
How can we calculate the value of the optimal production volume?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000
There are three ways to calculate this.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000
First of all, I must say that there is no ready-made formula

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
that can be substituted and get the result in one second.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The fact is that nonlinear processes

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
are very difficult to describe

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
as a function of the production itself.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Therefore, methods are used

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:38.000
that are difficult to study the process itself.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000
There are three ways to determine the optimal production volume.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Accounting, analytical, graphical and statistical.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Accounting and analytical are in cooperation with accounting information.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Here the maximum income and maximum costs are compared.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And it is compared in the sense that which of them grows faster.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
This comparison will be carried out until we find

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
such a state of maximum income and maximum costs

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
when they grow at the same rate.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
This is the optimal point that allows us to talk

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000
about the achievement of the maximum profit of the production unit.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
That is, the accountant can use this method

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000
and calculate the optimal production volume for us.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
There is a graphical method.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000
It is presented on the slide that you see now.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:50.000
It is a graph in the framework of the production volume and costs.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
The graph is built in which the changes of the maximum costs

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
and the changes of the maximum income are compared.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
We know that if we increase the production volume,

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000
then the increase in the production volume with the increase in each unit will decrease.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Remember the glass of water in the summer heat.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Every glass of water you drink brings you satisfaction,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
but less and less compared to the previous one.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So here you see that the maximum income is decreasing all the time.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
This is the pleasure you get with every subsequent glass of water.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Yes, it is positive, but it is less and less.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
And the maximum costs are the costs that arise

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
with the growth of costs that arise in this production process.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And the maximum costs increase because they become less effective.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Academics start working with a chisel and a hammer.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
And these curves intersect.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Finally, the maximum costs become equal to the maximum income.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And when they become equal,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.000
this is the point at which we reach the maximum income of a unit of production.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And the statistical method.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000
When a table is built in which the different volumes of production are arranged,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
and they look at the costs and the revenue at a given volume of production.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:22.000
The results are compared and they look at the maximum income.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000
The tools that you will consider in the e-book that is attached to this lecture,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
all these methods are considered in more detail.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Examples of calculations are given, and you can now stop the lecture

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
and look carefully at each of these methods

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and choose which one is more preferable for you.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I want to tell you again that there is no single formula

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
in which you can substitute some data

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
and instantly say the point of the volume of optimal production.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Therefore, this is a more complicated process

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
that requires careful research

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
to determine the point of optimal production.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Nevertheless, it is practically feasible,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:23.000
and you can safely give the task to your most responsible economists,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
accountants, to calculate, compare and determine

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
the volume of the optimal volume of production.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And then make the only strategic right decision

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000
that will allow you to work in this mode of optimal production.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.000
OPERATIONAL LEVER

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Now we move on to the third and final question of our lecture.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
The question is about the operational lever.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
The operational lever is also one of the techniques

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:24.000
that allows to judge how economically this enterprise is developing.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
No, it is not some kind of mechanical tool,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
these are techniques of financial management

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
that can be used, that need to be known,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
used in order to use them in practice.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
The operational lever is an opportunity for the enterprise

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
to influence the profit by changing the structure of its cost

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and the volume of production.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
By changing certain parameters within the enterprise,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.000
you can achieve an increase in profit at your enterprise.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
In essence, the operational lever depends

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000
only on the structure of the costs at your enterprise.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And you should remember that you have constant and variable costs.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.000
The size of the operational lever depends on the structure of these costs.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
The effect of the operational lever is that

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
even the smallest changes in the volume of sales

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
after reaching the point of no loss

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
cause significant changes in the economic results.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Therefore, it is very important to reach the point

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
where you compensate all the costs that you have.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Constant costs.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And after that, the movement after this point

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000
begins to sharply increase the profit that you have.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
The effect of the operational lever is determined

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
as the relationship of the shaft margin to the profit.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
This is the formula for calculating this effect.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Enterprises with high operational lever effects

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
have higher profits than enterprises

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
with a small operational lever.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
This is a very important point,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
it should be remembered and we should look carefully

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000
at the effect of the operational lever at your enterprise.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
It is very important to strive for the increase of the effect of the operational lever.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
To do this, you just need to increase the volume of production,

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
it will increase, and with this, the profit will increase.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
However, you should remember that

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
if you have a very high effect of the operational lever

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
and you are proud of it,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
after the slightest increase in the volume of production

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
the profit sharply increases, it is just wonderful.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
But any medal has a downside.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
If, by chance, the volume of production

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
begins to decrease at your enterprise,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000
then at the same rapid pace, the profit will begin to fall.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
The faster it grows, the faster it falls

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
with a high effect of the operational lever.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And vice versa, at the enterprise with a small effect

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
the decrease in the volume of production

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
does not cause such a significant decrease in the profit,

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000
just as it does not cause its significant increase.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Since the profit is very sensitive to the change in the volume of production,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
we can say that for enterprises with a high operational lever

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
the risk in business increases.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
This risk is significant,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
because with the slightest decrease in the volume of production

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
you risk losing a large amount of profit.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Therefore, it is stated that the higher the effect of the operational lever

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
on the enterprise, the higher the risk of entrepreneurship.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000
If you are very close to the point of no loss,

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000
then every percent of the volume of production

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
causes a significant increase in the profit.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
But the further you move away from the point of no loss,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
the more your production volume grows,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
the less the subsequent percent of the volume of production

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
causes a decrease in the profit.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000
The effect of the operational lever decreases.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It does not grow, it does not remain constant,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000
but it gradually decreases as the volume of production increases.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000
We will now fix these data on the example we will consider.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Pay attention to the slide that is now in front of you.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
We have two enterprises that produce the same product.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Two different factories, the same product.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Since it is the same product, the price of this product is the same.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Let's say the price is 200 rubles.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
The numbers are conditional, since the product is the same.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
What is the difference between these two enterprises?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Pay attention.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
The first enterprise has old equipment and constant costs are small.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
It is old, cheap equipment.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
The second enterprise has the latest equipment.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
It is more expensive, more perfect,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
it allows you to have a higher productivity,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
it saves the lives of the workers, but it is more expensive.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
The first enterprise has constant costs,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
the costs that change with the increase in the volume of production,

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
let it be 160 rubles.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
The second enterprise, due to the fact that it has more perfect equipment,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
which increases the productivity of the labor,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
in other words, it requires less workers than the first one.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
More productive equipment.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Therefore, the costs for the salary are less.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Therefore, we say that the costs for the salary are less, 140 rubles.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Both enterprises have the same production volume.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Let it be 25 thousand units, both enterprises produce the same amount of products.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Here is a question.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
In these two enterprises, what is the effect of the operational lever?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Which of these enterprises can use the effect of the operational lever

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
and use it in their business?

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Let's calculate it.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Such calculations will be included in the home task that you will perform.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
This example that we are doing now

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
helps you to complete the home task,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
but this is not the main thing now,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000
this is not a tip for completing the home task.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.000
The main thing is to understand the logic and meaning of the phenomenon of the effect of the operational lever.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
In order to calculate this task,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000
you need to determine the threshold of profitability for each enterprise.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
In other words, you need to calculate the point of profitability for each enterprise.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Why are you asking me?

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Here's the thing.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:56.000
The thing is that our enterprise produces 25 thousand units of products according to the task.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And where is the point of 25 thousand units?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
To the left or to the right of the point of profitability?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
The thing is that if it is to the left of the point of profitability,

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
then our enterprise is at a loss.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
If it is to the right of the point of profitability,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
then it is profitable.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
The management decisions are completely different in this case.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
We calculate the point of profitability for the first enterprise and for the second.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
At first, you see the formula for calculating the point of profitability.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
It is defined as the constant costs on the one hand in the numerator,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and in the denominator, the price minus the variable costs of the unit of production.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
By substituting the value in this formula, we get that for the first enterprise,

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
the point of profitability is 15 thousand units of products,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
and for the second enterprise, it is 20 thousand units of products.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
What does it mean?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:00.000
It means that our first enterprise should produce no less than 15 thousand units of this product,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
otherwise it will be at a loss.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You see, this is a very important point.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
We calculated how much we should produce.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000
And the second enterprise should produce no less than 20 thousand units of this product,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
because the equipment is expensive.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Expensive equipment makes us produce more products.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:26.000
But in our example, both 15 thousand and 20 thousand units of products

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
are lower than the production volume that we produce.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Remember, according to our task, our enterprise produces 25 thousand units of products.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Therefore, both enterprises work in the profit zone and get profits.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.000
After we have determined the point of profitability,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
the point of profitability for each enterprise,

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:02.000
and found out that each of these enterprises works in the profit zone and gets profits,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
we can carry out further calculations and solutions to our task.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
What interests us?

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000
We are interested in the effect of the operating lever.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
This effect is related to the profit.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:30.000
For the first enterprise, this effect is determined by the formula that you see on the slide.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:39.000
In the numerator, the marginal profit is determined as the difference between the revenue and the variable costs.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
200 minus 160, as per our task.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000
And in the denominator, the profit is more difficult to calculate.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:56.000
To calculate the profit, we need to subtract both the variable and the constant costs from the revenue.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
200 minus 160, as per our task.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And we also need to subtract the constant costs.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.000
We will determine the constant costs when we divide the total amount of constant costs,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
remember, according to the task, 600 thousand constant costs,

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
by the production volume.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And the production volume is 25 thousand units.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.000
We divide 600 thousand by 25 thousand, and we get the amount of the constant costs.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
The unit of production.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Thus, in the denominator, we subtract the variable costs from the revenue,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
then the constant costs.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
We get the profit.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Then we divide the marginal profit by the profit.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
It turns out that for the first enterprise, if you do calculations,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
2.5 units is the effect.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.000
The same we calculate for the second enterprise.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:00.000
But in the second enterprise, the variable costs are lower, 140, and not 160.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
The numerator increases.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
But we will have changes in the denominator.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:13.000
In the denominator, the value of the constant costs per unit of production will change.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
First, the total costs have increased.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
They are not 600 thousand, but 1.2 million.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Therefore, 1.2 million divided by 25 thousand,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
we get the constant costs per unit of production.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
We take into account that the variable costs are now 140, not 160.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
We substitute there, and we do the calculation.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:38.000
We get that for the second enterprise, the effect of the lever is 5.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
What do these coefficients mean?

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
The effect of the lever in this case will tell us

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
how many times the profit will increase faster

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
compared to the growth of the volume of production.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
That is, if in the first enterprise,

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000
for every 1% of the growth of the volume of production in the production,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
the profit will be 2.5%,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
then for the second enterprise,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
every 1% of the growth of the volume of production

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
causes a 5% increase in profit.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Both there and there, the volume of production increases by 1%.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Pay attention.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Moreover, the enterprise produces the same product.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
The prices are the same.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.000
The growth of the volume of production increased by 1%.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
But in the second case,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
only because the effect of the lever is more profitable,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
better than in the first enterprise,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
we get 2 times more profit than in the first enterprise.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
With other equal ones.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.000
That is, we see that the effect of the operational lever

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
in the first enterprise allows the enterprise

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
with a higher effect to get a higher profit

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
with the growth of the volume of production.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
With equal efforts, the profits are significantly higher.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
We have noticed here that the operational lever

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
is essentially caused by the change in the structure of costs.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
The second enterprise has more constant costs than variable ones.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
There is new equipment.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And in the first enterprise,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
the constant costs are less.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
There is old, outdated equipment,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
cheap equipment.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Thus, we see that the improvement of the equipment,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
which leads to an increase in the productivity of labor,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
a reduction in the costs of variables,

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000
leads to an increase in the effect of the operational lever

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
and, at the same time,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
the opportunity to get a higher profit

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000
with the same increase in the volume of production.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
That is, if an enterprise wants to get a higher profit,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
it must change the structure of its costs

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
so that the share of constant costs

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000
is greater than the share of variable costs.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Constant costs should be more than variable costs.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Constant costs should be more than variable costs.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
The attitude of constant costs to variable costs should increase.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Then the effect of the operational lever will be stronger

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000
and then the enterprise will get more and more profit

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
per unit of increase in the volume of production.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:47.000
What is the role of the business?

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
After today's lecture,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
you, as a businessman,

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.000
will be interested in optimizing the structure of your enterprise,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
the structure of constant and variable costs,

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
to work in the optimal mode

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
and get the maximum profit per unit of production.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
If you achieve this,

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
if it becomes real for you

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and you can do it at your enterprise,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.000
then I believe that this lecture has achieved its result.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000
And we have not wasted this time in vain.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
You can now take great advantage of it.
