00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
One thing is to provide a credit, and another is to get a debit card on time, not to let it go to waste.

00:12.000 --> 00:22.000
Therefore, all companies, even though they trust their partners, but still strictly monitor the debit card.

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
At every company that uses the credit system, there are employees who are responsible for the status of the debit card.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
This is the main part of their work, and they monitor the status of the debit card every day.

00:40.000 --> 00:52.000
They work with their partners, ask them when they will get their credit back, remind them, ask them to get their credit back on time.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
Therefore, the control of the debit card is the most important part of every company's work.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
If you don't remind your partner that he has to get his credit back on time, he can forget about it.

01:09.000 --> 01:22.000
The thing is that our companies don't always use fines when providing credit.

01:22.000 --> 01:35.000
If fines are not used when providing credit, or even worse, if they are not used, they are not required,

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
then the companies forget that they have to get their credit back on time.

01:42.000 --> 02:00.000
This can lead to a long-term debt, and even without a reward for this, the company can suffer losses.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
The company has to pay additional costs for the service of this debt.

02:06.000 --> 02:16.000
The company has to pay additional costs for the service of this debt.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
The most important thing to remember is that the debit card is a business mechanism.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
It is a necessary element, and it should be used as any other part of the business process.

02:29.000 --> 02:43.000
The company's debit card debt should be in the optimal state, and there should be a certain amount of it.

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
If the company's debit card debt is sharply increasing or decreasing, this indicates a certain process that is taking place in the company.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
For example, if the company's debit card debt is sharply increasing, what does this indicate?

03:01.000 --> 03:13.000
The first thing that should be noticed is that we have to compare the debit card debt with the growth of the production volume, or rather, with the volume of the implementation.

03:14.000 --> 03:28.000
If the volume of the implementation and the volume of the debit card debt grow at the same rate, then a sharp increase in the debit card debt is not a bad sign.

03:29.000 --> 03:47.000
If the volume of the implementation and the volume of the debit card debt grow at the same rate, then a sharp increase in the debit card debt is not a bad sign.

03:47.000 --> 04:01.000
If the debit card debt grows faster than the volume of the implementation, this indicates a non-considerable credit policy.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
This means that the money is being exchanged right and left.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
This is an inefficient operation of the company.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
This is unacceptable.

04:14.000 --> 04:25.000
Therefore, once again, look closely and compare the growth rates of the debit card debt and the growth rates of the production volume.

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
But the debit card debt is not only increasing because of the increase in the production volume.

04:36.000 --> 04:47.000
Sometimes the debit card debt is overdue when the company you gave the credit to does not return the debt.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
This can happen when the company becomes unpaid.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
And we can even talk about bankruptcy of some of the buyers.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
This is a disturbing sign.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
This is unacceptable.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
You need to know the financial condition of your partners, how their business is going.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
Therefore, it is advisable not to let the partners you work with to be in such a state.

05:19.000 --> 05:33.000
And the last case, but unfortunately, sometimes it happens, when the debit card debt is used to wash money.

05:33.000 --> 05:47.000
When the partners are provided with money not for the commercial loan, but to use this money for another purpose.

05:48.000 --> 06:00.000
The sign of this mechanism of using money is that this debit card debt is not planned to be washed.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
It is not trying to be returned.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
It is forever without return, but in three years it can be returned.

06:13.000 --> 06:35.000
If the company has such a debit card debt, it is a reason for the state authorities, in particular the Tax Inspection, to pay attention to the condition of such a debit card debt.

06:36.000 --> 06:48.000
And the most important thing is a reason for the owners of the company to pay attention to how their staff uses money.

06:48.000 --> 07:05.000
If the owner of the company is not aware that the employees use money in this way, then it is a reason to make the corresponding organizational conclusions for the company.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
We were still talking about the increase of the debit card debt.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
And what happens if the debit card debt is reduced?

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
First of all, again, in the same angle from which we started talking about the debit card debt.

07:23.000 --> 07:35.000
If the reduction of the debit card debt is associated with a reduction in the production load, then this is, on the one hand, a normal phenomenon,

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
because we reduced the production load, and subsequently the debit card debt was reduced.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
There is nothing wrong with this, there is nothing good about it.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
But on the other hand, the fact of the reduction of the production load and the reduction of sales is a sign of a decrease in the business activity of the company.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
This is a negative point.

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
That is, the reduction of the debit card debt is not a negative point, but a negative point that the business activity of the company has decreased.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
And the reduction of the debit card debt is just a consequence of this, and cannot be considered as a negative phenomenon.

08:12.000 --> 08:23.000
On the other hand, the reduction of the debit card debt can be considered as a positive phenomenon if it is associated with a reduction in the period of its cancellation.

08:23.000 --> 08:34.000
After all, the total amount of the debit card debt is associated not only with the amount, but also with the period in which these funds are presented.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
Therefore, if the period of cancellation of the debit card debt is reduced, then this is a positive phenomenon.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
It will return faster, and for the enterprise this is a positive point.

08:49.000 --> 09:00.000
Thus, it is impossible to judge unambiguously whether the increase or decrease of the debit card debt is a positive or negative phenomenon.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
Positive phenomena can be found in both increases and decreases, and negative phenomena can be found in both increases and decreases.

09:08.000 --> 09:18.000
The only way to determine this is in the context of the change of the debit card debt, that is, in the discovery of the reason why it happened.

09:18.000 --> 09:28.000
And only from the analysis of why this phenomenon can be said to be positive or negative from the point of view of the enterprise.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
The debit card debt can also be distinguished between normal and overdue.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
The normal debt flows from the business process itself.

09:38.000 --> 09:48.000
The business requires a 30-day period of overdue, so the 30-day debit card debt is normal.

09:49.000 --> 10:03.000
But if the debit card debt is not returned during the period that is stated in the contract, then it goes into the state of overdue debit card debt.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
That is, it is kept longer than in the contract.

10:07.000 --> 10:18.000
The overdue debit card debt is harmful for the enterprise, because the enterprise has lost the money it needs for normal functioning.

10:18.000 --> 10:27.000
And the enterprise begins to actively work to return the overdue debit card debt.

10:27.000 --> 10:36.000
Thus, when the enterprise organizes a service that deals with the debit card debt, this service performs a double job.

10:36.000 --> 10:47.000
It tracks the normal debit card debt and conducts an active work to return the overdue debit card debt.

10:48.000 --> 11:01.000
The debit card debt can be managed, and the service created specifically for this purpose actively manages the debit card debt.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
How is it done?

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
There are two phenomena at the heart of the management of the debit card debt.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
The first is the comparison of additional profit with the costs of changing the policy.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Look, what does it mean?

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
The enterprise could use the money from the bank in two ways.

11:22.000 --> 11:32.000
On the one hand, it can lend them in the form of a credit, and on the other hand, it could deposit them in the bank.

11:33.000 --> 11:42.000
And comparing these two processes, we can see which of these processes is more profitable for the enterprise.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
And, accordingly, in one direction or another, it can send money.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
If working with banks is not profitable, then the enterprise uses the active debt.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
If, on the contrary, depositing money in the bank becomes more and more profitable,

12:00.000 --> 12:08.000
then less and less money is sent in the form of the debit card debt in the form of a credit for the enterprise.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
This is one direction.

12:11.000 --> 12:22.000
The second direction of managing the debit card debt is related to the comparison and optimization of the length of the debit card and credit card debt.

12:23.000 --> 12:33.000
The thing is that we provide the debit card debt, and the credit card debt is provided by us.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
And, accordingly, comparing these two processes, managing them,

12:39.000 --> 12:53.000
we should strive to make the amount provided to us be more or less than the amount we give to our partners.

12:53.000 --> 13:13.000
In order to realize their product, the enterprise actively uses the debit card debt, and, with the help of the debit card debt, the enterprise is provided with discounts.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
Why is this done?

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Discounts are needed to activate the sale process.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
If the enterprise is provided with discounts, depending, for example, on the total volume of the purchase,

13:31.000 --> 13:40.000
then the greater the volume of the purchase, the greater the discount received by the partner on the purchase of the product.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
Thus, discounts are used to increase the volume of the production.

13:46.000 --> 13:54.000
The use of discounts leads to the increase of the volume of the production, to the increase of the debit card debt.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
As a result, with the help of discounts, the debit card debt can be regulated.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Here is the mechanism, the lever of the impact on the debit card debt.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
We want to increase the debit card debt, we want to use it more actively as a tool.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
So, we need to look at the discounts.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
Using the discount mechanism, we can actively use the debit card debt mechanism.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
Why else can we use the discount process?

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
The fact is that sometimes the enterprise is short of cash.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
Interference with cash on the enterprise.

14:34.000 --> 14:45.000
The enterprise is looking for ways to replenish the funds, trying to replenish them in one way or another, but this process is not always very fast.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
For example, it is not always very fast to get cash in the bank, even a short-term loan.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
It takes time, and the money needs to be fast, very quickly.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And then the discounts are used.

15:00.000 --> 15:10.000
With the help of discounts, the price discounts, it is possible to activate sales and additionally get cash on the enterprise.

15:10.000 --> 15:19.000
Discounts can also be used instead of fines.

15:20.000 --> 15:36.000
In fact, usually in contracts, the combination of the loan provided with the fine is used, in case the return date of the money is violated.

15:36.000 --> 15:46.000
But, as practice has shown, this is not the most effective way to manage the debit card debt.

15:46.000 --> 16:07.000
There is a more effective way, which is that the enterprise is offered an additional discount if the enterprise returns the money earlier than in the contract.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
That is, the contract provides for 30 days of the commercial loan.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
After 30 days, if the money is not returned, the fine is as much as the percentage that needs to be paid.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
And an additional condition.

16:24.000 --> 16:39.000
If the enterprise returns all the money in 15 days, then it will get a discount on the product it purchased in the amount of this percentage.

16:39.000 --> 16:48.000
This mechanism, according to international practice, is the most effective in terms of the return of the debit card debt.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
Because the enterprise is a buyer, who wants to reduce his costs of purchasing goods,

16:55.000 --> 17:05.000
and to correctly build up his financial policy in his company, and to strive to pay in advance for the debt he has.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
And due to this, to get additional discounts on the product that he has already purchased.

17:10.000 --> 17:18.000
In what case is it profitable for the enterprise to provide such a discount?

17:18.000 --> 17:26.000
The thing is that here again we need to compare what is more profitable for the enterprise.

17:26.000 --> 17:40.000
To use this money for your own production, to invest in profitability, to use it in your production to get additional profit.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
Or to leave it as a commercial loan from the consumer.

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
Is it more effective to use your own resources, your own financial resources,

17:55.000 --> 18:04.000
than the percentage that you will have to pay for the fact that you will be paid in advance?

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
For example, if your profitability of your business is 40% per month,

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
and you will get a 1% discount for the fact that you will be paid in half a month,

18:16.000 --> 18:24.000
then it is profitable to recalculate one to another, to get a 1% discount.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
Because using your own money, you will create much more profit in your own business,

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
than if you leave this money with the enterprise.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Moreover, the enterprise that takes your commercial loan,

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
has the opportunity to have a monthly discount on the payment of the commercial loan.

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
You do not force it to pay in advance, you just give it an additional opportunity.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
And then the enterprise itself decides what is more profitable for it.

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
So, the practice has shown that using such a mechanism in business

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
is the most effective way to get back the debit debt.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
Therefore, those businessmen who are listening to this lecture now,

19:17.000 --> 19:25.000
take this information into account and try to use this mechanism in your contracts.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
I think it will be very useful for you.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
In addition to discounts, which I actively suggest you to use,

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
you can use other mechanisms to get back the debit debt.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
The mechanism that is used more often than discounts,

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
but which is not actively used, is the mechanism of imposing fines for overdue payments.

19:52.000 --> 20:02.000
The fine should be such that it is more profitable to pay it back than to pay this fine.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
It is desirable to write down the fines.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Many enterprises do not write down fines at all,

20:10.000 --> 20:17.000
because they do not want to spoil the friendly relations with other enterprises.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
In fact, not writing down fines leads to the fact that the enterprise,

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
in quotes, just forgets that it needs to pay back the debit debt.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
It forgets, and then long processes of paying it back begin.

20:36.000 --> 20:43.000
There is an unknown case when for years the debit debt was paid back for one month.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Moreover, there were no fines.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
It would seem that the most friendly relations are simply not friendly.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
For years they were paying it back.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
Naturally, there was no talk of any additional compensations in the absence of fines.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
At least to return the amount that was directly presented in the form of a commodity credit.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
But such a situation, from the point of view of finance, is very unprofitable for the enterprise.

21:15.000 --> 21:23.000
Because money, turned off from the turnover, does not bring any additional income to the company.

21:23.000 --> 21:30.000
The presence of a fine sanction will to some extent secure you.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
Moreover, it will create a possibility in the case of a judicial decision on this issue

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
to demand a fine sanction that will cover the costs that may arise.

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
But if you do not want to quarrel, but want to live in friendly relations,

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
then I can advise you another way to speed up the return of the debit debt.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
This is to make a deal with the use of VEXEL with a percentage for the term of payment.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
What does it mean?

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
You provide a commodity credit, and in exchange you get VEXEL.

22:14.000 --> 22:22.000
Immediately you get VEXEL, which says that you can provide it to the VEXEL provider at a certain time

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
and get the amount you owe.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Thus, you have secured yourself.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
You have a financial document that must be accepted and paid.

22:35.000 --> 22:46.000
And instead of seeking a return of the debit debt, you just submit this VEXEL and get the payment.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
This is also one of the mechanisms, and very effective.

22:50.000 --> 23:00.000
The next mechanism is to apply in the case when you do not know the business partner well enough

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
to whom you are transferring the product you have produced.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
You just do not give it to the commodity credit, but sell it on prepayment.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
Remember, I have already told you today, that in the early 90s all foreign companies

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
provided the commodity credit for Russian businessmen on prepayment.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
This was the norm of business behavior.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
This is the norm for a novice businessman.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
He comes to you, and you do not know him, and no one knows him.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
First, you have to earn a reputation.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
Therefore, with the help of prepayment, a businessman earns his reputation.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
One time, second time, third time, fifth time.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
And on the tenth time, your trust in him gradually increases.

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
And you say, now I can provide you with a commodity credit, and you do not need to prepay anymore.

24:03.000 --> 24:11.000
The last mechanism that can be used to accelerate the return of the debit card debt is the factoring mechanism.

24:11.000 --> 24:21.000
I have already mentioned that factoring is a modern, new, young, growing mechanism

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
for the return of all kinds of debts that are in front of the enterprise, in particular, the debt of the debit card.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
You prepay the commodity, provide it in the form of a commodity credit,

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
sign a triple contract where the third party is the factoring company,

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
provide it with all the documents on the prepayment of this commodity,

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
and the company pays you.

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
It changes the debit card debt to the amount of funds that are owed to you.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
Not for the whole, usually for 90%.

24:59.000 --> 25:09.000
Thus, the mechanism of using factoring has an economic basis,

25:09.000 --> 25:17.000
and does not contain the mechanism of simply pumping money from the bank.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
And it was not a lie to the economic mechanism.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Factoring companies are now developing rapidly.

25:25.000 --> 25:32.000
It is very profitable to use the factoring business for those enterprises that are engaged in production.

25:32.000 --> 25:39.000
Moreover, factoring companies not only provide money,

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
they also perform other additional functions.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
For example, they can track the return of the debit card debt in time.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
They take over the function of tracking the work with the debitors.

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
Moreover, factoring companies insure the non-return of the debit card debt.

26:02.000 --> 26:10.000
And if an unprofitable partner is caught, who did not return his debit card debt,

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
then the factoring company pays for it.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
And then it interacts with the debitor to return its money.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
When working with unknown business partners, this mechanism is also effective.

26:29.000 --> 26:39.000
When you are insured and fully guaranteed that your money will return to you in integrity and safety.

26:40.000 --> 26:53.000
But it should be emphasized that the use of both short-term loans and factoring money is only profitable in one case.

26:53.000 --> 27:02.000
If the profitability of the business is higher than the costs of this scheme.

27:02.000 --> 27:11.000
If the business is low-profitable, then there is no point in resorting not only to factoring,

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
but also to take a loan in a bank.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
You should work only with your own funds.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
And it is even better if your business is high-profitable.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
If your business is high-profitable, everyone works with you with pleasure.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
Banks, factoring companies, employees feel great at this enterprise.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
And you as a businessman are very happy with the state of affairs in your business.

27:41.000 --> 27:50.000
The next question we will consider, perhaps the last question we have in today's lecture, is the management of cash assets.

27:51.000 --> 27:59.000
The fact is that the assets of any enterprise are in the form of money.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Money on the account.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
On the one hand, these money are very much needed by the enterprise.

28:10.000 --> 28:20.000
Because the enterprise has a current operational activity that needs to be covered and the costs that arise from this need to be covered.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
For this, money is needed so that it is there every day to cover such costs.

28:27.000 --> 28:41.000
On the other hand, in the conditions of inflation, keeping an excessively large amount in the form of cash on the account is not profitable for the business.

28:41.000 --> 28:48.000
If there was no inflation, then it would be a completely different conversation.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
But if there is inflation, it devalues money every day.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
It is like a clock, it counts the seconds of devaluation of money.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
And the more money on the account, the more it disappears every second.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
It disappears, disappears and disappears.

29:07.000 --> 29:16.000
Therefore, having a lot of money on the account means losing a lot of money every second because of inflation.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
But if there is not enough money, then you cannot cover your current needs.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
Not covering your current needs leads to a failure of production.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
Imagine, you can't buy stocks of raw materials, production has stopped.

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
Yes, you saved, you did not lose on inflation, but production has stopped.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
So, again, there is a golden mean.

29:44.000 --> 29:55.000
There should not be too much money on the account, but there should be exactly as much as is needed to cover the current needs.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
So that you do not have daily problems in your business.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
What needs are being covered?

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Are all the needs that the enterprise has to cover with money?

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
No, only the primary ones.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
Only those needs that cannot be transferred even for tomorrow.

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
The coverage of which today is more important than their repayment.

30:27.000 --> 30:36.000
These primary needs should be covered by money and these money should be on the account.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
If there is more money on the account, it means that they are not being used effectively.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
They are being lost.

30:46.000 --> 30:54.000
Moreover, even if there was no inflation, we could also talk about the ineffective use of money.

30:54.000 --> 31:04.000
Because this money could be invested in other forms of assets that bring additional income.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
We should pay attention to this.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
At least the minimum is a deposit in the bank.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
There is a deposit in the bank, there is an additional income.

31:14.000 --> 31:22.000
The money on the account does not bring any additional income to the enterprise.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
This should be understood.

31:25.000 --> 31:33.000
And we should understand that the money on the account is the minimum sacrifice that the enterprise is making,

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
but without which it is impossible to function normally.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
To determine the minimum amount of money that should be on the account,

31:44.000 --> 31:50.000
we will use the formula that is presented on the slide that you see now.

31:50.000 --> 31:59.000
The minimum amount of assets needed for the enterprise is determined as the ratio of the estimated payment turnover

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
for the current economic operations in the coming period according to the plan of income and expenditure,

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
to the turnover of cash assets in the following monological accounting period.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
Please note that the numerator here is the estimated payment volume,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
that is, how much you plan for the future.

32:21.000 --> 32:28.000
For example, this year we plan that we will need this amount of money.

32:28.000 --> 32:37.000
And in the denominator, the turnover of cash assets in the same accounting period in the past.

32:37.000 --> 32:47.000
That is, how many times cash assets of this enterprise are calculated per year.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
This is the peculiarity of this formula.

32:50.000 --> 32:57.000
By dividing one into another, we will get what amount of cash assets we need on the account.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
The fact is that the assets that we have on the enterprise are constantly being converted.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Remember the liquidity of the assets, their ability to convert into cash.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
So the assets are constantly being converted from material form to cash form,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
and all the time money appears on the account.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Again and again you are realizing the product.

33:19.000 --> 33:29.000
So this minimum amount should remain not less, but not more than what is required for the current needs.

33:29.000 --> 33:35.000
And the current needs are determined in terms of income and expenditure.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
Here is an important question, that the plan is real.

33:39.000 --> 33:48.000
So that the amounts that must be paid in the current time are reflected there.

33:48.000 --> 33:55.000
And that cannot wait until the additional transition to cash form occurs,

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
and the money is accumulated in order to make payments.

33:59.000 --> 34:07.000
This is the peculiarity of determining the minimum amount of cash assets.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
In conclusion, we will consider an example,

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
with which we will calculate how much cash assets should be on the enterprise's account.

34:18.000 --> 34:27.000
Let's say, according to the plan of income and expenditure,

34:27.000 --> 34:35.000
the turnover on the enterprise per year is provided in the amount of 500 million rubles.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
The turnover of cash assets is 25 times per year.

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
Hence the question, what is the amount of cash assets that should be on the account all the time.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
According to the formula, which we have considered above,

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
we divide the total amount of cash assets, which should be turned over on the enterprise,

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
by the number of turns, which will occur.

35:00.000 --> 35:07.000
We conclude that the minimum amount of cash assets on the enterprise is 2 million rubles.

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
If the enterprise received 2 million rubles, what does it mean?

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
It means that it should make sure that at the beginning of every day,

35:20.000 --> 35:28.000
on the account, the enterprise has such amount of cash assets.

35:28.000 --> 35:36.000
It can be used, but the next day it should be restored.

35:36.000 --> 35:46.000
Thus, within the turnover, this amount should be on the enterprise's account.

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
The enterprise works with it, actively uses it, and it is restored 25 times per year.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
It is restored 2 times per month.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
The amount of cash assets is spent for 15 days.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
After 15 days, it should be restored.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
And again, 15 days are spent.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
And at the end of the cycle, it should be restored and spent again.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Thus, we have determined the minimum amount of cash assets,

36:18.000 --> 36:26.000
which should be on the enterprise's account and used to pay the current payments.

36:36.000 --> 36:44.000
Today's lecture was devoted to the work with the enterprise's own assets.

36:45.000 --> 36:53.000
We have shown that these assets play a very important role in the enterprise's financial life.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
They cannot be left to the self-interest.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
They need to be looked after closely.

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
Because their active use allows to significantly improve the financial position of the enterprise.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
If the enterprise is left to the self-interest, its financial position will be zero,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
up to bankruptcy.

37:17.000 --> 37:23.000
The enterprise's financial service should actively work with these cash assets,

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
monitor them, manage their debt, and the reserves on the enterprise,

37:29.000 --> 37:35.000
and, moreover, monitor the amount of cash assets on the account.

37:35.000 --> 37:43.000
By monitoring these three processes, the enterprise will always be in excellent financial shape.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
This is what I wish to all of you who are listening to this lecture.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
All the best to you. See you next time.
