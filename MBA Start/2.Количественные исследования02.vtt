00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
OK, we've talked about statistics, we've talked about linear programming.

00:08.000 --> 00:17.000
Linear programming assumes that you are in the deterministic world.

00:17.000 --> 00:29.000
When we were solving the problem about nuts, we secretly assumed that all the nut mixtures that we produce would be bought from us.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
And at the prices that we set.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
But are we always so sure?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Of course, not always.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
In fact, it is unlikely that a person can be so seriously sure, except if we are talking about abstract mathematics.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Imagine this situation.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
You are a boy who sells newspapers.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
You buy newspapers from the editorial office for $1 and sell them for $2.

01:03.000 --> 01:14.000
If you fail to sell all the newspapers, the editorial office is so kind to you that they take these newspapers from you for 50 cents each.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
You are a smart boy, and you have managed to calculate that the average demand for your newspapers is 100 pieces a day.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
But this is the average demand.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
And the standard deviation is, let's say, 20 newspapers.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
Under the conditions of this task, what should be the optimal order?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
As usual, we optimize the profit.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
It should be less than 100, exactly 100, more than 100.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
And if it is more than 100 or less than 100, then how much should it be more or less?

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Here a certain uncertainty is involved.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Uncertainty is a concept that is wider than probability, as we have already noted.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
Nevertheless, we will consider that in this case we are dealing not with uncertainty as such, but with its part, probability.

02:12.000 --> 02:22.000
In general, this particular task has a fairly accurate solution.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
But for solving such a task, the so-called Monte Carlo method is used.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
A beautiful and loud name.

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
Everyone immediately imagines a James Bond who sits in Monte Carlo and wins roulette.

02:39.000 --> 02:54.000
But in fact, the Monte Carlo method is a method of numerical solving of tasks by a certain random number generator.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
In Excel, in Russian-language Excel, the function that generates random numbers is called solchisl.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
In general, in all other programming languages, it is called rand, from the word random, from English.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
This function gives the value of the evenly distributed interval from 0 to 1.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Why exactly from 0 to 1?

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
Because the probability can take a value from 0 to 1.

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
Accordingly, the value of the solchisl function is distributed from 0 to 1.

03:31.000 --> 03:48.000
How can we use the solchisl function to create a different distribution, different from the evenly distributed interval from 0 to 1?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
For these purposes, the so-called reverse distribution serves.

03:52.000 --> 04:08.000
In our case, since we believe that the sales of newspapers are distributed normally, we will use the function that in Russian Excel is called normstobr.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Normal standard reverse distribution.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
What will such a function do?

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Normal cumulative distribution looks like this.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
It increases smoothly and decreases to 1.

04:27.000 --> 04:41.000
Thus, the solchisl function, the random number, imagine an interval from 0 to 1, where this function is.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
The random number will give the value from 0 to 1.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Accordingly, we will look for the corresponding point on this graph, horizontally.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
And then we will mark the number of standard deviations on which this point is located.

04:58.000 --> 05:10.000
Generating the random number that has the corresponding distribution, we will repeat this process many times.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
And we will get the result that we can already work with.

05:17.000 --> 05:34.000
In the case of a boy, we will generate the sequence of demand for his product and compare which of the orders will lead to the highest profit.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
It should be noted that this is not a Svender model, this is not the only task that can be solved in this way.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Of course, the Monte Carlo method can solve anything.

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
Therefore, as an example, we will look at the modeling of gambling games.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
Gambling games are a very favorable ground for the implementation of the Monte Carlo method.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
For one simple reason, the uncertainty used there is almost a pure probability.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And, of course, no one is trying to deceive you.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
Yes, the Monte Carlo method lacks elegance and strictness.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
Of course, sophisticated mathematicians will never accept the results obtained by the Monte Carlo method as proof.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
This is natural.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
The solution to the Monte Carlo method may require significant computational power.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Here the so-called curse of dimensionality begins to work.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
Imagine that you are modeling the American option using the Monte Carlo method.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
The American option is an option that can be implemented at any time between the start and the end of its operation.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
You will have to model the duration of the option for 90 days.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
And you want to simulate, do a thousand simulations every time.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
For example, you do a thousand simulations on the first day.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
At the end of the first day, at the end of each simulation, you do a thousand simulations.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
This is already a million.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
On the third day, you do a billion.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
On the fourth day, you do a trillion.

07:17.000 --> 07:26.000
By the 90th day, the computational power of all existing computers will be exhausted.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Unfortunately, yes, sometimes this requires significant computational power.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But, fortunately, not always.

07:31.000 --> 07:39.000
Therefore, the Monte Carlo method is quite effective in some cases and is practically impossible to use in others.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
What else is necessary from the Monte Carlo method?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
It is desirable to have a reliable and reproducible random number generator.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Why should the random number generator be reproducible?

07:48.000 --> 08:03.000
If you change something in your model, you must understand that the result that appeared is primarily due to changes in the model,

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
and not to changes in the fact that you have completely different random numbers.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
Such a thing as reproducibility is a very useful thing.

08:14.000 --> 08:24.000
It should be noted that the random number generators used in the Monte Carlo method are based on simple numbers,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
on a pair of two simple numbers.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
And recently, the calculation of random numbers has become a serious business.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
As I promised, the task is simpler.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Or more complicated, as you like.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
The task is as follows.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
You come to the casino and play such a game.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
The probability of winning is 52%.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
You have a large amount of money with you, 10 thousand dollars.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
Since you know that your game is winnable, you choose which bet to make.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
4% of your prosperity or 15% of the prosperity of what you have now.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
At the same time, since the game is quite strange, you play exactly a thousand times,

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
and your goal is to take as much money as possible with you.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Or, if you want, you can look at it differently.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Two different players come to the casino.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Player 2, who always bets 4%,

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
and Player 1, who always bets 15% of what he has in stock.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Let's see.

09:36.000 --> 09:46.000
Here is a graph of how the amount at the disposal of a particular player will change.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Okay.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, here they are both unlucky.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
Here, despite the fact that the game was winnable,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
both of them lost.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
But pay attention.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
Player 1, who bets 15% of his prosperity, has lost a long time ago and hopelessly.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Player 2 still has some money.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Now I will press the F9 button,

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
and thus every time a new round will be re-read, a new thousand games.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
Here, Player 1 seems to be even lucky.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Player 1 earned more than $ 90,000 at some point.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, that is, 110,000 minus about 10,000, with which he came.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
But in the end, everything returned to its own in the circle,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
and Player 1 went bankrupt.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
While Player 2 fluctuated a little,

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
and in the end remained with a more or less noticeable and acceptable amount.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
So, no matter how many times we press the F9 button,

10:55.000 --> 11:04.000
almost always a player who bets a smaller amount will win.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Pay attention, he is in lilac.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Here, even a decent amount is earned.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
And so on.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
In exceptional cases, under conditions of very high luck,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Player 1 will win.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
But this will be extremely rare.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
The situation will worsen even more

11:30.000 --> 11:45.000
if we change the probability of winning from 52% to, say, 50.2%.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Here, in fact, it is 50.2%,

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I will show that it is really 50.2%.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
Then we need to bet not even 4%, but 0.4%

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
so that our money grows as fast as possible.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Let's see.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
The game is quite boring for the player.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
But if you pay attention, the game of Player 1 is very fun,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
but nevertheless completely unprofitable.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
And of course, we laid some unrealistic assumptions

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
that the probability of winning is 50.2%.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Of course, the probability of winning is never 50%.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
With a probability of winning of 49%,

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
the question of how much to bet has a very simple answer.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, in general, not much.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Although sometimes, as you can see,

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
in some cases, one or another player will either remain practically at 0%

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
or lose a little bit.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
But if you pay attention, a player who bets 15% of his state

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
loses under such conditions guaranteed and very, very quickly.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
This task, in this case, is solved by the Monte Carlo method,

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
simulating the existing values.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Let's return to the task of the newspaper seller.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
As I said, the price of the newspaper purchase is $ 1,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
the price of the newspaper sale is $ 2.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
What is called an underage cost,

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
the under-order price is $ 1,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
the overage cost is $ 0.50.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
That is, the publisher buys the newspaper purchased for $ 1 for $ 0.50.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
The average demand for the newspaper is 100,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
the standard deviation is 20.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
What are we going to do here?

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
We will simulate the demand.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
It will be distributed approximately normally.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
The distribution will be slightly different from the normal,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
but this is not very critical.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
We will simulate the demand

14:40.000 --> 14:51.000
and we will see how the level of the order affects it.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
In this line, we have different boys.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
One boy orders 106 newspapers, the other 108, the third 110, the fourth 112, and so on.

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
We will see how the order amount affects the profit they receive.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
Here is a simple macro that will generate demand.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
We will run it now and leave it for a while.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
We will leave the computer to count for a while.

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
As you can see, we have generated a little more than a thousand different demand values.

15:33.000 --> 15:41.000
We will build a graph of how the order level affects our profit.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
Here are several different order levels and the profit that corresponds to them.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
We will insert a graph here.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
As usual, it will be a point graph.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
We will use our order as x, and our profit as y.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
The graph shows that the optimal order will be somewhere around $108-110.

16:11.000 --> 16:19.000
The optimal order is affected by several conditions.

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
In particular, the fact that we used a slightly shifted distribution.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
In addition, each time we generate a new batch of data, we will fluctuate around the optimal order.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
In fact, the optimal order is somewhere around $112-113.

16:42.000 --> 16:51.000
It would seem that there is not much difference between a person who ordered 124 and a person who ordered 108.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
The difference is literally $3,000.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
But let's think about it.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
There are no other possible expenses on this graph.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
In particular, rent, food, etc.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
Imagine that the necessary expenses are $90,000.

17:12.000 --> 17:20.000
Thus, a person who ordered 124 newspapers gets a profit of just under $1,000.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
While a person who ordered 108 newspapers gets a profit of almost $4,000.

17:28.000 --> 17:38.000
This is almost four times higher than the level of 124 newspapers.

17:38.000 --> 17:50.000
Or, of course, the 100 newspapers will be located at the level of $92,000.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Nevertheless, the difference will be significant.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
If we are talking about profits, not sales, then the difference will be significant.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
Let's look at our distribution histogram.

18:01.000 --> 18:10.000
It looks like a normal distribution.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
Note that the demand was several times lower at the level of zero.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Of course, we limited the demand from the bottom to zero.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
It is unlikely that someone will come and sell a boy a newspaper.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Nevertheless, the demand was several times lower.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Note that our average is only about 100 newspapers.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
The demand was several times higher.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Fortunately, the model of newspaper sellers has a strict solution.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
You can find it in the course application.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The point is not in a strict solution.

18:44.000 --> 18:52.000
The point is that we can solve quite difficult tasks using the Monte Carlo method.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
Traditionally, after the end of the course, there are two tasks,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
and then, after a while, the solution of all six tasks.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
The first task was given at the Moscow City Mathematical Olympiad for fifth-grade students.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Two friends in the park meet.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Hello, hello, long time no see.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Are you married? Yes.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Do you have children? Yes.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Do you have two sons? Yes.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
How old are they?

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
The number of their ages is the number of pigeons on that bench.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
The person thinks and says, I am not old enough.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I forgot to tell you, the older one looks like a mother.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Then it is clear.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
According to the available and the missing data,

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
you should guess how old the sons of the second friend are.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Another task.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Imagine that you have your eyes tightly closed,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
and in front of you on the table is a collection of coins.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Some unknown number.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Of course, you can count them even with your eyes closed.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
It is known that exactly 26 coins lie upside down.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
The coins need to be divided into two piles,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
so that there is an equal number of coins in each pile.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
And you, since your eyes are closed,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
cannot distinguish the top of the head from the tail,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
and cannot distinguish by touch how the coin lies.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
That is, a hint.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
All you can do with coins is count and flip.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
The first task.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
A boat floats in the pool.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
There is a 32-kilogram cast-iron boat at the bottom.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
The boat is thrown into the pool.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
How will the water level in the pool change?

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
The water level in the pool will decrease.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
The fact is that while the boat is in the boat,

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
the boat can hold the amount of water equal to its mass,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
that is, 32 kilograms or 32 liters.

20:41.000 --> 20:47.000
Since the liter was chosen.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
No, the kilogram was chosen.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
Accordingly, when the boat is at the bottom,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
it can hold not 32 kilograms or 32 liters of water,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
but only the volume that it takes.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
It takes about 4 liters.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
The density of cast-iron is about 8.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
32 kilograms divided by 8.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
The total volume of the boat is about 4 liters.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
In the pool, the water level has decreased by 28 liters.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
That is, the water level will decrease.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Next.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
The lever scales on which a glass of water is attached.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
You put your finger in this glass.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Of course, without separating it.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Yes, it seems that you hold your finger yourself.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
However, you probably do not take into account that...

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
And those of you who guessed before, well done, of course.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
You do not take into account that in order to push your finger into the water,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
you overcome some resistance.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Some resistance of water.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
What happens in this case?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
From the point of view of the glass, by the way.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
The water level rises in the glass.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
And from the point of view of the glass,

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
it does not know anything about what is in it.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
The water level has risen.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
The pressure has increased.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The glass honestly transfers this pressure further,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
that is, it presses on the scales.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And the glass will overweigh.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That is, from the point of view of the glass, it has become heavier.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
The task with the bridge.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
Well, most often, the first thing that comes to mind is to send the fastest one,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
and let him run, wear this flashlight.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
This way you will get the result in 19 minutes.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
You can check.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
In fact, there is a general operating principle.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
What exactly?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
The principle is quite simple.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
If you have two long processes,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
they need to be launched in parallel, if possible.

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
Thus, those people who go 5 and 10 minutes should go together.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
How to do this?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Well, of course, they cannot be launched first.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
So, the first ones should be those who pass the bridge in one minute and two minutes.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Then one of them, regardless of which one, should return, give the flashlight.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Then 5 and 10 should go to the other side of the river.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
The second of the first two should return, and again they should pass again.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
Thus, we get 2 minutes there, 1 minute back,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
this is 3 minutes, 10 minutes there, 13 minutes,

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
2 minutes back, 15 minutes, and 2 minutes forward, 17 minutes.

23:21.000 --> 23:30.000
This way we get a decision that is almost 10% better than the decision that comes to mind automatically.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
It seems to me that 5 minutes of thinking is worth 10% improvement in performance.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
The task with the camel.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
There is another general operating principle.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I will tell you which one.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
The first one, how to solve it.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
It becomes clear almost immediately that there is a trap.

23:52.000 --> 23:59.000
If you load a camel with thousands of bananas and let it go to the maximum distance,

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
then, of course, the camel will not deliver any bananas.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Moreover, it will not be able to return even back.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
All this camel tuning, self-loading, self-unloading,

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
the system of cargo sustainability, GPS and the desert serve the same purpose.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
The camel should be able to remove some part of the cargo from itself.

24:22.000 --> 24:29.000
And then return to the same place, knowing that the cargo will remain in safety.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
So, the first step to the solution would probably be, for example,

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
the camel takes a thousand bananas, goes 400 kilometers, throws 200 bananas,

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
returns back, takes a thousand again, goes 400 kilometers, throws 200 bananas,

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
returns back, takes a thousand, goes 400 kilometers.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Here we find that in the place where he left the bananas, 400 bananas are already lying.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And he ate 400 bananas.

24:58.000 --> 25:05.000
He loads 400 bananas on himself, goes the remaining 600 kilometers,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
and thus he can deliver 400 bananas.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Then the question arises, is this quantity maximum?

25:12.000 --> 25:23.000
Maybe you can do something, if, for example, change the first pass of the camel?

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Or maybe you can make more stops, and then the camel can deliver more?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
It turns out that the general operational principle in this case is this.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
If you have equipment, it is desirable that the equipment works with maximum load.

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
That is, we need to divide our thousand kilometers into points so that

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
the camel starts with maximum load from each point, from each new point.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
That is, if it starts with a thousand bananas three times from the first point,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
then from the second point it should start twice with a load of a thousand bananas,

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
and from the third point it should start once, but with a load of a thousand bananas.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
If you write down the equation, it is actually the simplest.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
To get to the first stop, the camel should go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
that is, five times.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
During these five times, it should spend a thousand bananas.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
It is easy to determine the distance it should cover, 200 kilometers.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Now we have 2,000 bananas left at the second point.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
We need to go back and forth, and during this time spend a thousand bananas.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
During this time, the distance should be 333.1 kilometers.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
Thus, from the third point, which is 200 plus 333.1,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
the camel starts again with a thousand bananas.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Well, how many bananas will it eat?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
But it will be able to deliver the same 533.1.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
This is the optimal amount, you can check it in other ways.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
The task of the producer.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
This is a rather interesting task, of course.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
There is information, as you have probably already seen,

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
where it is, and where it is not.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
Of course, the information starts with the phrase

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
that two sons of a preschooler are growing up.

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
We assume that a preschooler is a child who is 7 or younger.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
What happens next?

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
The person says that the number of pigeons is equal to the number of adults

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
around that bench, and this is not enough.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
That is, the solution is two-dimensional.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Let's think further.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
What information is there that the elder looks like his mother?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Well, of course, not that he looks like her,

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
and not that he has a mother.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
The information is that there is an elder.

27:56.000 --> 28:06.000
So, before that, when the first friend said that he did not have enough information,

28:06.000 --> 28:14.000
he was afraid that these sons could be twins.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
But since he was afraid that the sons could be twins,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
this greatly simplifies our decision.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
We will look for an answer in advance among the full squares.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Thank God, there are not so many full squares.

28:26.000 --> 28:38.000
For some reason, you can immediately discard such numbers as 3, 5 and 7.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Let's discuss.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Let's say we take 49.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
There were 49 pigeons.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
What options do we have?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Either 1 and 49, or 7 and 70.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
49 is not the same preschooler.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
7 and 7 are discarded because there is an elder.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Let's go further.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
36.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
What options are there?

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
6 and 6, 2 and 18.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
18 is certainly not a preschooler.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
3 and 12, 4 and 9.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
9 is also not a preschooler.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
25 is the same, since it is a simple number.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
5 and 5, 1 and 25 do not work.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
16 pigeons were possible.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
What options are there?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
1 and 16, 2 and 8, 4 and 4.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
4 and 4, since there is an elder, is discarded.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
2 and 8, 8 is a preschooler.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
The same thing happens with 3 and 3, or 1 and 9.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
9 is not a preschooler.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
1 and 1, there is only one option left.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
They are twins and they are one year old.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
Accordingly, 4 remains.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
2 and 2 are discarded.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
The second son has 1 and 4 years.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Another question about coins.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
The question is quite simple.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Pay attention.

30:00.000 --> 30:08.000
The condition of the question says that the coins should be divided into two piles so that there is the same number of coins in each pile.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
It is not said anywhere that there should be 13 coins.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
It is said that there should be the same number of coins.

30:15.000 --> 30:24.000
Thus, you can use the logic that a double negation is the same as a statement.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Or, to put it simply, minus to minus gives a plus.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
You count 26 coins.

30:29.000 --> 30:37.000
Let's say that among them there was a K, a coin with a cap up.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Then how many coins are left in the second pile?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
26 minus K.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
Now you turn the 26 coins that you counted, in which there was a K, a coin with a cap up.

30:48.000 --> 30:55.000
And now there are 26 minus K coins in this pile.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
That is, the K coins that were with a cap up are now with an eagle up.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
And the coins that were with an eagle up, 26 minus K, in this pile, were in the right pile.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
They are now with a cap up.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
As we remember, 26 minus K remained in the left pile.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
Thus, we got the same number of coins with a cap up.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
There are many such tasks, such interesting tasks.

31:16.000 --> 31:23.000
They need to be solved in order to make your brain work.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
And solving them is very useful.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Thank you.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Thus, the course is over.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
I would like to draw your special attention to such a part as statistics.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
Of course, statistics is not necessarily a recurring thing.

31:40.000 --> 31:47.000
But statistics often allows us in our, of course, stochastic world,

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
to get some more or less definite, if not forecasts,

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
then preliminary results, perhaps.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Let's call it that.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Because it is generally difficult to predict.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
People do not predict well.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
This has been proven many times.

32:07.000 --> 32:15.000
Preliminary results that will help you to cope better with your business.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
If you are engaged in business or with your own work,

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
if you are in some business and you are doing it.

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
Of course, such things as linear programming and Monte Carlo method are also extremely useful.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
But still, I would advise you to pay the most attention to statistics.

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
Of course, the issue of the repeatability of statistics can be very difficult.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
But, unfortunately, we have nothing else left,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
or most often there is nothing else left,

32:50.000 --> 32:57.000
but to believe that the conditions that existed in the past will be repeated in the future.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Study statistics, study its application in business and good luck to everyone.
