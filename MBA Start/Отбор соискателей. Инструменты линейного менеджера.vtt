00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello, my name is Elena Shpak. I am the head of the Department for Selecting Personnel in the Industry and Sales, HR of Human Capital.

00:14.000 --> 00:29.000
Today I want to share my experience on how to conduct an interview, how to find out the candidate in an hour or an hour and a half, how to get reliable information about him and draw a conclusion.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
I will try to offer you an algorithm for solving the task of selection and evaluation.

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
Of course, this is not a dogma. All people are different, and in order to become a professional in this field, of course, you need to learn, collect new technologies and find your own way.

00:44.000 --> 01:03.000
Nevertheless, certain patterns and methods exist here. Our department will be dedicated to selecting and evaluating personnel by linear managers, because all the responsibility for selecting personnel lies on these specialists.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
How to find out the candidate in an hour and a half?

01:08.000 --> 01:21.000
As a rule, an interview is conducted at the level of common sense, and it seems that this is quite enough. But do you know what percentage of information we get in words or text?

01:21.000 --> 01:32.000
Only 7%. 93% is intonation, movement, gesticulation, facial expressions, emotional coloring of what a person says.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
Do you know what percentage of accuracy in an interview, when we conduct at the level of intuition?

01:39.000 --> 01:50.000
So, only 7% to 15% if we are talking about a biographical interview, when the candidate is simply asked to tell about himself, and we just listen.

01:50.000 --> 02:03.000
Behavioral interview, when we ask the candidate to tell about what really happened and how he did it, only 65%.

02:03.000 --> 02:17.000
Assessment center, when for two or three days the candidate is forced to solve different tasks and tested on professional and personal qualities, is only 70% accuracy.

02:17.000 --> 02:36.000
100% is not given by any technology. We know that, as a rule, an average recruiter gives an assessment at the intuitive level. So, usually, in one case out of three, this intuition and assessment are absolutely incorrect.

02:36.000 --> 02:54.000
The cost of replacing one incorrectly selected employee is one year's salary, a whole year's salary. If we are talking about a top manager, then, according to various estimates, such losses of companies can amount to up to three years' salaries.

02:54.000 --> 03:08.000
Interesting numbers. The first selection of specialists occurs after the assessment of their CV. Do you know how many candidates provide their CV with, to put it mildly, distorted information?

03:08.000 --> 03:24.000
So, from 60 to 90% of candidates complete their salary in their CV. More than 65 candidates report incorrect information about their education in their CV.

03:24.000 --> 03:41.000
And from 40 to 60% of candidates report incorrect information about their work. So, on the basis of the accuracy of the information we receive, we allow ourselves to conduct an incorrect interview.

03:41.000 --> 04:01.000
Before we stop at the signs and consequences of an incorrect interview, I want to give one more interesting number. When we hire an employee, in 80% of cases we hire him because of his professional knowledge, skills and skills.

04:01.000 --> 04:25.000
But when we fire an employee, in 85% of cases we fire him because of his work. What is a poorly conducted interview and what are its consequences? The main and most unbearable consequence is the loss of good candidates. Today, the market is full of specialists, and this is simply an unacceptable luxury.

04:25.000 --> 04:42.000
The second point is the poor and incomprehensible feedback on the candidate. If the candidate is good, then his feedback is dazzling and does not say anything. If he is bad, then to say that he does not suit us and I feel this at the level of chemistry is categorically wrong.

04:42.000 --> 05:08.000
In this case, neither the HR nor the internal staff know how to continue the search. The search is simply by touch. Naturally, this leads to a delay in time, financial and time losses. The situation in the department, where the vacancies are still not closed, is also not very good. People work with overload. It is not possible to create a normal working environment.

05:09.000 --> 05:27.000
The consequences of a poorly conducted interview are also the lack of management of the candidate's expectations. There are two aspects. The first aspect is when a person who did not get into the company for work has high expectations. When does this happen?

05:27.000 --> 05:51.000
When instead of an interview, he is given a trusting conversation. The interviewer, the line manager, usually and the candidate simply talk about business, about life, share some impressions. The line manager talks about tasks. At the same time, he reveals certain know-how, some technologies and some completely unnecessary things to a stranger.

05:51.000 --> 06:05.000
The candidate thinks that he has already been accepted. After that, they say to him, sorry, you do not suit us. What happens? Disappointment, resentment, bewilderment. These emotions are taken to the market by the candidate. This certainly spoils the reputation of the company.

06:05.000 --> 06:22.000
The second moment is when the candidate is given a promise at the interview stage, but the candidate still becomes an employee. I want to assure you that everything that the line manager says to the candidate at the interview, the candidate will remember.

06:22.000 --> 06:42.000
And in just a little time, maybe half a year, maybe a little more, the candidate will come and ask, you promised me that in half a year my salary will be indexed. Or you promised me that in a year I will become the manager. You will have to somehow explain to him what it was just to get him into the company.

06:42.000 --> 07:01.000
Another very important point. We are talking about the disadvantages of an interview in a macro sense. When the image is lost, when candidates bring bad information to the market. There is also a moment of an incorrectly conducted interview, directly related to the technology of conducting the interview.

07:01.000 --> 07:27.000
First of all, it is a long time. It is believed that it is normal to conduct an interview for an hour. If we are talking about high positions, then, of course, this time is not enough. And it can be an hour and a half. But you need to remember that after an hour and a half, the interview becomes viscous. People get tired, attention is dulled, and the conversation becomes practically nothing. No new information appears.

07:27.000 --> 07:49.000
The second point. When the interviewer does not take the initiative in his own hands and, as it were, lets go of the interview process. He sits and just waits for the candidate to tell what interests the interviewer. And the candidate is passionate about telling what he knows or wants to tell. It is completely incomprehensible why conduct such an interview.

07:49.000 --> 08:06.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that any interview should be structured and thought out in advance. You need to understand exactly why we asked a question and how we interpret the answer. Otherwise, everything becomes uninteresting.

08:06.000 --> 08:30.000
The form of the interview also seriously affects the quality of the candidate's assessment. In this case, there are two mistakes. The first is an interview interrogation. When the interviewer asks questions to the candidate in a rigid, non-emotional form. Of course, the candidate is stressed and closes. It is almost impossible to get any reliable information.

08:30.000 --> 08:51.000
And the other side of the coin. When the interview turns into a sale. The interviewer, instead of assessing and understanding the candidate, tries to sell the vacancy. He tries to tell as much as possible about the company, the business, the work, and so on. And to keep silent about the shortcomings. This is also completely wrong.

08:52.000 --> 09:17.000
Another mistake is the interviewer's personality. The interviewer, like any living person, is influenced by external factors. For example, by the charm of the personality, by the influence of the brand. It seems to us that if a person came from a large, well-known brand company, then he must have some special knowledge and technologies.

09:18.000 --> 09:38.000
And in the interview, instead of learning about a person's real experience and finding out why he leaves such a company, the interviewer simply talks to him and exchanges impressions. In addition, the interviewer, of course, relies on his life experience. He is trapped in stereotypes and his past knowledge.

09:39.000 --> 10:02.000
Traditionally, it is believed that technologists are calm, reasonable and structured people. And as soon as we see in the resume that such an education is written and a person has been engaged in technology for many years, it seems to us that he should be just like that. But technologists, as well as lawyers or philologists, can be completely different. And unstructured and emotional.

10:03.000 --> 10:21.000
But the most important mistakes that emerge during the interview are still embedded before the meeting with the candidates. These mistakes are associated, first, with the assessment of the requirements for the candidate we want to find and with the mistakes in the assessment of the workplace.

10:21.000 --> 10:49.000
Very often, managers want to get a highly qualified specialist for a certain vacancy, not realizing that, firstly, such data is not needed for this vacancy, he will quickly get bored. And the other danger is that, having gained experience in such a not very high vacancy, he will create a certain discomfort for his manager and his colleagues.

10:51.000 --> 11:04.000
What is the assessment of the candidate?

11:04.000 --> 11:33.000
Before moving on to the topic of technology and the method of conducting an interview, I would like to say a few words about what. The assessment of the candidate that takes place during the interview and the knowledge that we receive about him during the interview is extremely valuable. Because then, when he becomes our employee, this knowledge will help us to manage him correctly, to understand in which areas, at what work, he will be as effective as possible.

11:34.000 --> 11:55.000
I want to focus on some factors of people's efficiency. According to Lee Ikoki, business is ultimately reduced to three concepts. These are people, profit, and product. People in this trilogy are the first. And if you do not have a reliable team, then with the other two factors it is unlikely that something can be done.

12:05.000 --> 12:18.000
The company Panasonic has achieved outstanding results not only thanks to its technical achievements, but also thanks to special social technologies. Social technologies are primarily associated with the disclosure of human potential.

12:18.000 --> 12:38.000
The managers of these companies believe that their main task is to create such working conditions for a person so that when he feels fully fulfilled at work, he would be really successful. And indeed, in such an environment, people show completely unique results of their work.

12:39.000 --> 12:59.000
In other words, the key to the efficiency of the company and the efficiency of production is the ability to work with people. What I want to say is that we employ a person thanks to his professional skills and knowledge. And it seems that if he comes to the company, he must be necessarily effective.

12:59.000 --> 13:28.000
In fact, this does not happen. It has a huge impact on how much he fits into the team, how much the environment in the company will allow him to realize his ambitions. Ambitions can be completely different. This is a desire for professional growth, a career, and independent decisions. It is quite possible that these will be encouragement, awards, and public recognition for some people. This is very important.

13:29.000 --> 13:54.000
During the first stage of the interview, we already receive information about the person's main goals. And if the company, for example, cannot provide a person with professional growth and development, but wants a ready specialist, then it is unlikely that the candidate who says that the development of new technologies and products is the main thing for him, will not fit into the company.

13:54.000 --> 14:16.000
If career growth is extremely important for a person, and he sees a challenge in this, and for him it is an interest and a desire, and in the company people work 5-7 years and it is impossible to become a manager faster, then no matter how professional a person is and no matter how interesting his knowledge and experience are, he will definitely not fit into the company.

14:16.000 --> 14:33.000
Of course, it is impossible to understand all the factors that will affect a person's success in an interview, but some can be understood. I want to list these factors, because this is extremely important information, and we can understand something already at the stage of selecting a candidate.

14:33.000 --> 14:53.000
Let's talk about the factors that affect a person's individual behavior and his successful activity in the company. The first and probably the most important factor is the ability to perform a specific job. Of course, all people have different abilities, and the task of a line manager is to determine these abilities and use them correctly.

14:53.000 --> 15:22.000
When is it extremely important? For example, about the formation of working groups. Imagine that in the marketing department you need to form a working group to solve a task or to carry out a project. All specialists are marketologists, but you need to include a creative marketologist, an analyst who is able to work and analyze a large amount of information, and a person with a strategic vision who can describe the entire project in detail.

15:22.000 --> 15:41.000
This is not an easy, but very important task of a line manager, namely to determine the abilities. The second factor that affects success is the predisposition to a certain activity. In fact, we are talking about the potential of an employee. When is it important? It is important when forming a personnel reserve.

15:41.000 --> 15:56.000
Imagine that a specialist is going to learn management skills, and if a person does not have a predisposition to management, then time, money, and resources will be wasted in vain.

15:56.000 --> 16:16.000
The third factor is the value orientation of a person. Of course, we are talking about what a person values, what is important to him in life, what paths he sees, what he is ready to accept and never step over. The most important factor of a person's success.

16:16.000 --> 16:31.000
The interests of people. The interests of people act as an inciting mechanism for the development of a personality. They push a person to learn something new in his work, to master new technologies, to acquire new knowledge.

16:31.000 --> 16:45.000
Expectations of people must be realized at work, otherwise the work will become uninteresting. The most powerful factor is both the activation of a person's activities and his suppression.

16:45.000 --> 16:58.000
Taking into account the point of view of people's relationships, this factor is the basis of a person's corporate nature, his loyal attitude to his company, corporate culture.

16:58.000 --> 17:26.000
The last factor is the satisfaction of needs. Of course, every company strives to create a symbiosis. When the interests, expectations, and needs of a person are satisfied, the company only wins.

17:26.000 --> 17:48.000
We have understood what factors affect a person's success. In the interview, we try to understand how a company that is accepted by an employee can provide a candidate with the most comfortable conditions for his implementation and successful activity.

17:48.000 --> 18:09.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that when we make this assessment, we are not looking for an ideal candidate. We are looking for a candidate that is most suitable for us, our tasks, our structure, and for us personally, because we constantly interact with him.

18:09.000 --> 18:21.000
There are no bad candidates or bad companies. There are candidates that simply do not fit this company and companies that do not fit the candidate.

18:21.000 --> 18:40.000
We have come to the point of conducting an interview. When a candidate enters the line manager, he goes through two stages of the interview. The first is a general interview in the HR department. The second interview is always conducted in the HR department.

18:40.000 --> 18:57.000
Before understanding the difference between an interview and a line manager, you need to understand what is the difference between an interview in HR, HR staff, and a line manager.

18:57.000 --> 19:14.000
The first is that a person came to the HR department. What are the nuances? For a candidate, coming to the HR department, this is just a moment of an interview. His behavior within the company in the HR department can be fundamentally different.

19:14.000 --> 19:28.000
The HR department can conduct only one interview, and the goal of this interview is to find out the candidate as well as possible, so that he can be successfully sold. The second point is not to replace the candidate.

19:28.000 --> 19:44.000
A specialist in HR can have enough professional knowledge to evaluate a candidate, but you need to understand that this does not always happen. Here the reliability of this check is determined by the level of the agency with which you work.

19:44.000 --> 20:00.000
After this, the candidate gets an interview with the HR manager already inside the company. There are several nuances. The HR manager certainly knows the whole situation in the company very well, unlike the HR department.

20:00.000 --> 20:29.000
The manager knows the special requirements, the special atmosphere, and corporate culture. For him, in principle, there are no questions in terms of who he is looking for and why. But a specialist in HR in the company can not always conduct a professional assessment of the candidate, due to the fact that, as a rule, recruiters are engaged in a huge range of specialists, and they cannot know every area in detail in which they work.

20:30.000 --> 20:59.000
A specialist in HR has several opportunities to evaluate a candidate, unlike HR, where it is traditionally not customary to conduct psychological or other tests. Inside the company, a person can be subjected to a polygraph, psychological, professional testing, security check, and a collection of recommendations. All this information is naturally collected by the HR manager.

20:59.000 --> 21:15.000
And after this, if the candidate has successfully completed these interviews, the person gets an interview with the HR manager. Of course, the opportunity of the HR manager is immeasurable. He can meet with the candidate 2, 3, 5 times.

21:15.000 --> 21:41.000
But, as a rule, the following happens. A huge number of current cases and tasks do not allow the HR manager to spend a lot of time on meeting with the candidate. This happens either very quickly or superficially, and he tries to make an assessment as quickly as possible, instead of spending an hour and a half on thoughtful and structured interviews.

21:41.000 --> 21:56.000
Of course, a line manager, from a professional point of view, is better than anyone who can understand a person. But most likely, in the absence of experience in assessing personal characteristics, this assessment will not be complete and absolutely correct.

21:56.000 --> 22:14.000
The behavior of the candidate also changes dramatically. One thing is the inevitable evil of the HR manager. The second thing is when you just need to skip the manager in the selection service. And the third thing is when you need to make the best impression on the line manager.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
The candidate, I must tell you, can change dramatically from interview to interview.

22:44.000 --> 23:01.000
It seems right if an HR agent who does not have complete information on the vacancy, personal requirements and corporate culture of the company, finds out all the external data from the candidate. What is included in this data?

23:01.000 --> 23:18.000
Of course, the general information about the company in which the candidate works. This is the name, the type of business, the country, the city, the number of companies, the structure of the company. This is very important information to understand from which corporate culture the person came.

23:18.000 --> 23:35.000
Very often, candidates hide information about the location of the company, in which city it was located. Experience acquired by a person in Vladivostok or Novosibirsk may be completely unnecessary in Moscow. They understand this perfectly and do not indicate this information in the resume. And this is important.

23:35.000 --> 23:51.000
The second block of information that a HR specialist can find out is everything related to education. There are companies for which education is one of the most important characteristics of a candidate. And in this case, absolutely everything becomes important.

23:51.000 --> 24:08.000
Daily or evening education? On-site or in-person? What is the average score of a person who graduated not only from the institute, but even from school? An additional education is an important point. Did the specialist study himself or was his additional education paid by the company?

24:08.000 --> 24:29.000
It is important to understand what purpose he received this education. Was he sent to a higher school or institute to receive a second higher education? If a candidate has a degree in scientific development, invention, this can all be asked by an employee of a HR agency.

24:29.000 --> 24:53.000
Of course, based on experience, even if a specialist does not have enough knowledge for professional assessment of a candidate, which happens quite often, he can still find out what projects the candidate had, what results he completed, what failures and successes there were.

24:53.000 --> 25:15.000
Not to mention the place in the structure of his company, level of subordination, number of subordinates. These points are important because in further interviews, specialists can return to this topic again, clarify and check whether the candidate said everything correctly, did not mislead anyone.

25:15.000 --> 25:42.000
A personal information of a specialist is an important part of the interview. It is believed, especially in the West, that it is not very convenient to ask questions about age and family status. Nevertheless, in Russian companies, this remains relevant. And very often, a question, if a person is not married, raises a certain confusion.

25:42.000 --> 25:50.000
Therefore, an employee of a HR agency can easily find out this information in a rather delicate form.

25:50.000 --> 26:04.000
An important topic is motivation. Motivation is the expected level of the candidate's income. And here you need to clarify absolutely everything. What does the candidate expect? Is it net salary or gross?

26:04.000 --> 26:25.000
What currency is he considering his salary in? Is he waiting for a social package from the employer? Compliance with the labor code. Why is this important? Because now, in a situation of a shortage of specialists, candidates with this item of their CV are always misleading potential employers.

26:26.000 --> 26:52.000
A person in a CV indicates one amount, then comes to an interview and indicates another. And when he comes to the final interview, if he is a successful candidate, he can name an amount three times more than the original one. Of course, this is a signal of inadequacy. But if you do not enter this data into the presentation from the HR agency, then it is impossible to understand how the situation in terms of salary changes.

26:52.000 --> 27:06.000
Additional information is also important. The level of knowledge of foreign languages, which the HR agency can easily clarify. The level of knowledge of computers, special programs, and so on.

27:06.000 --> 27:26.000
So, the specialist has gone through the interview at the HR agency. The HR agency has collected all the information I said and makes a small presentation, applies it to the CV. I must say that when the candidate goes from one stage of the interview to another, the CV must be transmitted without changes.

27:26.000 --> 27:42.000
What is this related to? The CV is not just a source of formal information about the candidate. It is a reflection of his personality. The way the candidate tells about his work, what facts and figures he brings, can tell a lot about him.

27:42.000 --> 28:01.000
A very short CV indicates that the candidate is not interested in looking for a job and placed his CV just to see if there will be any market reaction. Or the candidate, on the contrary, wrote his CV on five pages, telling about any trifle he did at work.

28:01.000 --> 28:18.000
This is also a signal of how the candidate is able to assess some strategic things, how he sees the completeness of the project, how he sees the cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, the CV, of course, is transferred with the candidate without changes.

28:18.000 --> 28:45.000
So, the candidate gets to an interview with a HR specialist. We have already said that professional knowledge will not be checked. But what can the HR agency do? Of course, check the candidate's corporate culture, his personal characteristics, how stress-resistant he is, how self-motivated he is, how he can behave in unusual situations and conditions.

28:45.000 --> 28:59.000
Of course, he can sell his vacancy professionally and tell about the company. These are all tasks of the HR agency. And after that, the candidate with two applications in his characteristics gets to the line manager.

28:59.000 --> 29:14.000
The line manager is the most important link in the process of evaluating a candidate. Because it is the line manager who has to work with him, to be responsible for the quality of the candidate, to be responsible for how he will fit into the team, how loyal and corporate he will be.

29:14.000 --> 29:39.000
Therefore, the line manager needs to be evaluated from all sides and understand how comfortable the manager will work with this person. But seeing the previous description characteristics, he can focus on the most important things – professionalism, personal coincidence and the ability to integrate the candidate into the department.

29:39.000 --> 29:57.000
So, let's summarize. There is no technology that allows you to evaluate a candidate with 100% accuracy. This is the first point. The second point is that up to 90% of candidates mislead us in their CV, regarding education, experience and salary.

29:57.000 --> 30:24.000
Therefore, in order to somehow increase the accuracy of the assessment, we divide all the information that we collect from the candidate into three parts – between the HR agency, between the HR manager and between the line manager. This gives us the opportunity to clarify and double-check the most important and most subtle points of the candidate's biography several times.

30:27.000 --> 30:39.000
What is an interview?

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
So, we have come to the topic of conducting an interview.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
What is an interview?

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
An interview is a conversation between two or several people.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
The goal of this conversation is only one – to get to know the candidate as much as possible.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
To evaluate him from the point of view of whether he fits our vacancy or not.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Interviews have no other goal.

31:03.000 --> 31:14.000
In order for an interview not to turn into a friendly conversation, the interviewer must listen for as long as possible, and the candidate must speak.

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
The time ratio of the candidate's conversation and the interviewer's conversation is 80 to 20.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
This is a well-known rule.

31:22.000 --> 31:30.000
It is believed that if the interviewer speaks more than 20% of the time, the interview is not conducted by him, but is conducted with him.

31:30.000 --> 31:39.000
During the interview, we must determine the skills and experience of the candidate, the compliance of the vacancy, and understand his threats.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
I really like the matrix that can be formulated as follows.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
This is the candidate's matrix – wants, can, controls, safe.

31:47.000 --> 31:59.000
If during the interview we get answers to all four questions – can the candidate do this job, does he really want to do this job, does he control the process of work,

31:59.000 --> 32:10.000
and is he safe for the vacancy – these answers to these questions allow us to make a final and argumented decision on the candidate.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Yes, he fits us, no, he doesn't fit us.

32:13.000 --> 32:21.000
I must tell you right away that if there is at least one no in this matrix, the candidate certainly does not fit us.

32:21.000 --> 32:28.000
Because it is most likely that it is not necessary to talk about the possibility of accepting an unsafe or uncontrolled candidate for work.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
So, let's analyze all categories in sequence.

32:31.000 --> 32:38.000
The first, probably, the main category is related to the professional experience, skills and knowledge of the candidate.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
This category is – can.

32:40.000 --> 32:50.000
We determine how a candidate is able to perform the planned duties from the point of view of the existing competencies or acquired in the future.

32:50.000 --> 33:03.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that here we determine not only what a person already knows, but also his potential for learning, how much he can be taught to do this job.

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
For example, if he takes some additional courses, or a training center, or something else.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
The category can includes experience, ability to learn, and success.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Why do I want to draw your attention to success?

33:17.000 --> 33:27.000
Because very often a person has been doing a job, and maybe even for several years, but there have been no breakthroughs, no results, no success.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
I will give a simple example. I had such a candidate.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
An amazing resume, two foreign languages, and personal charisma.

33:34.000 --> 33:41.000
For about six years, he was engaged in sales on the B2B market and sold complex equipment.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
Everything was great for my client, he was candidate number one.

33:45.000 --> 33:56.000
But when I began to find out in great detail what he was selling and with what success, it turned out that he had never sold anything during these years.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
The reasons for the failure of sales were very clearly argued to them.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
The first time it was super-new equipment, and the market was not ready at all.

34:06.000 --> 34:16.000
The second time, it was super-expensive equipment, and the market was not ready to buy such equipment when there were a lot of cheap competitors.

34:16.000 --> 34:24.000
The third time he got into a business that was turned down by the government, and again his sales were unsuccessful.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
Of course, my client and I refused such a candidate.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
Success is the most important indicator.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
How can we determine all these three indicators?

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
Well, a person's experience is determined by direct questions related to his work.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
For example, if we want to evaluate a sales manager, the most direct questions are asked.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
Have you ever won new territory for yourself?

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
If you once opened a branch, please tell us how you did it.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
How do you turn a random customer into a permanent one?

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
What is your database? What clients are your priority?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
This is the first question.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
The second is the ability to learn.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
This is a slightly more difficult question, because you need to understand, in addition to what a person is capable of,

35:17.000 --> 35:23.000
but does he have a desire to develop, expand his professional knowledge and gain new experience?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
These questions can be somewhat different.

35:26.000 --> 35:34.000
For example, tell us how you did it when you realized that you didn't have enough knowledge to solve the problem.

35:34.000 --> 35:42.000
Or give us an example when you took on more responsibility than you had.

35:42.000 --> 35:48.000
How did you do it? Why did you do it? What experience did you get from it?

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
And the success category is again based on the example of a sales manager.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
Tell us how many clients were in your database when you joined the company?

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
How many clients did you have? How many active clients were in your database?

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
How much time did you need to create such a database?

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
Or maybe a question with a slightly more indirect sound.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Tell us about your most interesting project.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Tell us about the most successful.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Maybe about the most unsuccessful.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
And about how a person will tell, with what intonation.

36:24.000 --> 36:32.000
We can draw a conclusion as to how much he is ready to receive such, let's say, negative experience.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
What conclusion does he draw from this? What lessons does he learn?

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
The category can be used very well with the help of the case interview technique.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
What is it? Cases are the construction of certain tasks or situations.

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
When we offer a candidate to fantasize a little, how he would behave in a given situation.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
There is a slightly different category of cases that test his professional skills.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Then he must tell how he behaves in this situation.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
Of course, it is necessary to understand that when we give a candidate such a task,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
then, of course, we hear socially desirable answers.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
And even if he does not do so in life, answering our question,

37:14.000 --> 37:22.000
he will try to tell how he would have behaved if he had the opportunity to replay everything.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Here we look at the emotional coloring of the solution to this task.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
And yet, despite the fact that he gives a socially desirable answer,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
there is a certain accuracy of this assessment.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
All cases can be divided into three parts.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
The first case is the one that tests the candidate's professional skills.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
These are very simple cases related to solving tasks.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
What can it be? For example, tell me, please,

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
how would you act if you had to open a branch in a foreign city?

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
And the candidate tells what is the algorithm for opening branches,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
how would he act in a given situation.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Another question, for example, related to this.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
Tell me, please, you have received a task to develop a marketing plan for a new product.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Please, what will you do?

38:10.000 --> 38:16.000
These are professional cases, and we immediately see how the candidate reacts,

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
how quickly he reacts, how he gives several ways out of the situation.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
We understand his professional knowledge, and variability of thinking,

38:27.000 --> 38:33.000
and the speed of thinking, and readiness to solve complex tasks in an interview state.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
This is still not a standard situation.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
The second category of cases, I would say,

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
are cases related to assessing a person's personal values,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
his certain priorities.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
What can be the cases in this case?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Very simple. Let's put it this way.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
We ask the candidate,

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
you found out that your colleague speaks ill of you.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
This is very disturbing for you to work, and creates a bad atmosphere in the team.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
Tell me, what will be your actions?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Or another case.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
You found out that your colleague, not a subordinate, not a boss,

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
constantly commits unkind acts towards the company.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
They do not hurt you in any way, but you know about it.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Tell me, how will you behave?

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
What can we understand from these cases?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Of course, the candidate's values.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
On the one hand, he commits actions, like in the second case,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
towards his colleague,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
and it seems that the actions are bad,

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
but it is also traditionally unkind to knock.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
And because the candidate will consider this situation,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
what outcomes he will look for,

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
we will see his values, his decency,

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
his loyalty to the company, his priorities.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
And another large group of cases,

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
which are well used when we assess the candidate's personal characteristics.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
I should draw your attention to the fact that there are personal characteristics

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
that are strictly related to the category of can.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
For example, for sellers, the ability to find a way out of conflict situations

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
is an absolutely professional skill.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
The same as the ability to negotiate.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The same as stress resistance.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
The same as the personality trait creativity,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
absolutely necessary for a marketer.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
For example, I will give you such cases,

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
which we define the ability of the candidate to find a way out of a difficult situation.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
For example, you and your colleague, we say to the candidate,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
come to a large presentation to your client.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
A very important event,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
and your colleague should hold the presentation.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Suddenly, before entering the client,

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
you know, I'm so nervous that I'm just not able to focus.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Your actions.

40:51.000 --> 40:57.000
And we look at how our candidate will behave in this situation.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
What will be the accents?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
He will try to transfer the presentation.

41:01.000 --> 41:08.000
He will try to persuade his colleague to gather him and help him to tune in to the presentation.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Or he will just take the situation on himself and say,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
it's okay, I know what to talk about.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Because the main thing for him will be the goal.

41:15.000 --> 41:21.000
Here we will see, in addition to stress resistance and the ability to find a way out of a difficult situation,

41:21.000 --> 41:27.000
we will also see such a characteristic as a desire to achieve the goal.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
There is a slightly different situation.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
For example, you came to a foreign city.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
Also such a case, probably even interesting.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
You came to a foreign city, go to a conference,

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
you find out that you have neither documents nor money, nothing at all.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Your actions.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
How will you act?

41:46.000 --> 41:53.000
Sometimes when I have to interview personal assistants to the first persons of the company,

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
I ask such a question and it turns out that, in general, very often personal assistants are lost.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
The question is very simple.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
Imagine that for a long time, for example, a week,

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
you agreed to meet your boss with a very high official, for example, a deputy minister.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
The meeting is very important and you know about it.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
And on the day when the meeting is to take place, your boss leaves the office an hour later.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
It is quite clear that he is late.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Your actions.

42:23.000 --> 42:29.000
And you can imagine that there are personal assistants who rush to protect their boss,

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
tell him that the plane has just arrived, the weather conditions did not allow him to arrive earlier.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
And there are personal assistants who say that they will call, apologize,

42:39.000 --> 42:49.000
ask to cancel the meeting and somehow try to adjust to the high official to whom their boss is going.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Different characteristics.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Such a simple case.

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
I should draw your attention to the fact that if with the help of cases we check non-professional knowledge,

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
when a person should think, concentrate, weigh and say,

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
and check stress and stability, the ability to get out of conflict situations,

43:06.000 --> 43:13.000
certain reactivity, quick decision-making, then we should hurry the candidate.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
Not just sit and listen when he comes up with and tells us a case,

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
but constantly adjust it and say further, and then, and why, and why.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
This creates some artificial stress,

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
but it will allow us to better understand how a person really has such characteristics.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
So, we have disassembled the category of can.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Now let's move on to the category of wants.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
What is wants?

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
This is how motivated the candidate is to perform the proposed work,

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
and most importantly, why he wants to work in this particular company.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
What questions can we ask to understand how motivated the candidate is to perform the work?

43:55.000 --> 44:04.000
Of course, the question is what prospects do you see for yourself in our company or on our vacancy?

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Why did you decide to consider this vacancy?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Are there any questions about it?

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that asking such a question,

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
and whether the candidate has a question on the proposed vacancy, is necessary.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Because if the candidate has no questions, and he has already come to the interview,

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
then most likely the candidate is not interested in this vacancy of the company,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
and he just wants to leave his current job.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Agree, this is absolutely not the same.

44:33.000 --> 44:39.000
An important question is what your current employer could do

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
so that you do not leave the company, so that you stay.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
Today, an important question must be asked,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
especially since the situation of counter-offers,

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
when the candidate goes through all the interviews, receives an offer in the company,

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
returns to his employer and says,

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
I received such and such an offer, but you can leave me, increasing my salary.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
Today the situation is just typical.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Although a year ago, this was very rare,

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
and was considered as an improper behavior of the candidate.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
A good question is what else do you not like in your last job?

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
A traditional question is why do you want to leave your company?

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
Or a question based on previous experience, why did you leave your company?

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It is best, of course, to ask the question,

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
what interested you in a new company and in a new job?

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
The category wants to check very well with design methods.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
We will dwell on them in more detail.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
This is a good technique,

45:43.000 --> 45:51.000
because the candidate is asked to assess an abstract situation that is not related to him.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
I remind you that if in the case he decides the situation,

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
being inside the situation, as an active person,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
he tells about his possible actions,

46:00.000 --> 46:05.000
then in design technique he assesses and says in general.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
An example of a design question.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Tell me, please, why do people make a career?

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
Or why do not specialists steal?

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
A good question is why do people continue to work actively

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
when their boss leaves for a business trip or vacation?

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
A person does not talk about himself, he talks about other people.

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
At the same time, he relaxes and becomes more open.

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
Of course, design technique gives a lower probability of socially desirable response.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
When using design techniques,

46:37.000 --> 46:43.000
it is necessary to remember that the key thing when we assess the candidate's response

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
is his emotional color of the response.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
Just like in the case, we must ask the candidate to answer faster

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
and give several options for answers.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
In the case when he talks about other people, this is not very difficult.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
When are design techniques used?

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
Certainly, in the assessment of the true motivators of the candidate.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
Of course, material and non-material motivation is important.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
The second point is the attitude of the leader and the employee.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
All questions related to what the leader should be,

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
what a great employee should be,

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
what should be the company of your dream.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
This works very well when we understand

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
how much the candidate's expectations can be realized in our company.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
Of course, the value system, which I have already mentioned.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Why employees do not steal, why they work honestly.

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
Let's look at the true motivators of the candidate.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
This is a very important point, and we need to understand

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
how much a person corresponds to our corporate culture,

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
how much he is ready to correspond to it,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
and what is important for him.

47:55.000 --> 48:02.000
What is hidden behind the words I want a new job, I want a white salary, or something else?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I will give you a few examples.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
We ask the candidate a question.

48:07.000 --> 48:14.000
Please tell me what is the most important thing for an employee in work.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Why does a person work diligently?

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
Why does he strive to work successfully and for a long time in the company?

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
Maybe a few questions, they can be formulated in several ways.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
And we hear the following answer from the candidate.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.000
A person works effectively in a company when he has clear goals.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
What does this mean?

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
This means that if an employee does not see a clear goal,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
and he has a blurred area of responsibility,

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
then most likely he will not be effective.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
When we understand such a feature of an employee,

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
we need to know that it is very important for him to set clear goals,

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
to set check point,

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
and to make him report at certain moments,

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
and he must see the ultimate goal of his work.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
Maybe another answer is heard.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
When a person works effectively,

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
then when work is interesting for him.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
An interesting signal, because it is not clear

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
what a person means when he says the word interesting work.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
It is necessary to clarify.

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
If for a person creative work, interest is really important,

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
then it is necessary to understand that it is not suitable for routine work.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
This specialist should be used in creative projects.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
Routine will just suck him in and he will lose instant interest.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
I had such an example of a candidate who came to work in a large holding,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
and he really wanted to work there.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
He wanted so much that after receiving a task from the company

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
to develop a case in order to try to take a vacation,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
he did not sleep all night and at 8 am he stood at the door of the holding

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
with the completed task and waited for the manager who passed by him

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
and said, oh, you have already made a case.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
He got into this company, for about six months he worked 12 hours a day,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
building his department.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
After that, the department was built, the connections were established,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
there was a great structure of interchange.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
And how did it all end?

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
This specialist is of a very high level, well-educated,

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
but extremely creative, just bored.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
And when I talked to him, he spoke quite frankly.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
My working day ends at 5 pm.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
Until 8 pm, when it is convenient for the manager of my level to leave work,

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
I read books, sit on the Internet and do not know what to do.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Complete loss of interest.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
Of course, for his senior manager, this is a task.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
Such a specialist needs to be used in complex, interesting projects

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
that would be a challenge for him,

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
and where he could really fully implement his non-standard approaches

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and skills.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
Often we hear in interviews, when we ask the question,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
what do you want from a new job,

51:14.000 --> 51:20.000
people talk about independence, responsibility, some powers.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
Of course, for these people, it is necessary to understand

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
that after a while they will need a career step.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
It may not be very high,

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
but, for example, a specialist will become a leading specialist,

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
a leading specialist will become the head of the group.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
So when we talk and ask such a neutral, seemingly, question,

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
why do people work effectively and what motivates them,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
we get very serious, deep motives of the candidate,

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
why he himself wants to work and what is important for him in his work.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
Analysis of the true motivation of the candidate

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
is important not only at the time of the acceptance of the candidate for work

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
and for understanding his entry into corporate culture,

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
but, as I said, this is extremely important information

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
for the management of the candidate in the future,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
when he becomes a company employee.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
The third point of our matrix is controllability.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
A fairly complex category,

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
which is difficult to understand and difficult to determine.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
What is controllability?

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
It is the readiness of the candidate to follow the rules, regulations,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
the regulations adopted in the company.

52:33.000 --> 52:39.000
And additionally, it is enough for the candidate to develop self-criticism,

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
the ability to admit his mistakes, to learn lessons.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
How to determine the controllability of the candidate?

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Direct questions, how you did it,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
most likely it is very difficult.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
To determine the controllability,

52:53.000 --> 53:00.000
we will use a new technique called behavioral questions.

53:00.000 --> 53:06.000
Or in other sources, such questions are called competence interviews.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
What is this technology?

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
Here we ask a person a question about his experience,

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
but not just tell me and that's it.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
We start to dig very deeply into the situation.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
If we say, please tell us your actions,

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
with which you managed to implement the idea,

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
with which your manager disagreed,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
then we do not just let go of the situation,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
the candidate tells us how he managed to implement this idea,

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
but we ask clarifying questions.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
How did you understand that your manager disagreed?

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
What do you think, why did he disagree?

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
What attempts did you make to convince him and to incline him to your side?

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
Of course, by the way a person tells how he got out of this situation,

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
how he negotiated with his manager,

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
how he defended his plan, project,

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
we understand how controllable this person is.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
Very often there are cases when a candidate says that

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
I offered him 1, 2 and 3,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
I proved the correctness of my plan,

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
my manager disagreed, I wrote a resignation letter.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
Of course, this is not a very good characteristic of the candidate's controllability.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
Good questions on controllability are related to the work discipline.

54:26.000 --> 54:32.000
How much a person will be ready to accept the rules of the discipline adopted in the company.

54:32.000 --> 54:39.000
If in the company, traditionally, all training programs are held in the off-work hours,

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
then it is necessary to find out how a person will treat the fact that he will study in the off-work hours.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
And you need to ask this several times,

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
so that he does not give a socially desirable answer,

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
yes, of course, he treats it perfectly.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
A simple question with business trips.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
We know that on the vacancy, on which we are looking for candidates,

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
a person will spend 70% of the time on business trips.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
And, accordingly, the question to the candidate,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
what do you think about business trips?

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
He will answer, I treat it normally.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
But we need to understand that he is not just treating them normally,

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
but that the candidate wants to go on these business trips,

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
that this is an interest for him, a challenge for him.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
He sees in this the possibility of his development,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
he finds new connections,

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
contacts, expands both the professional sphere and the sphere of some personal interests.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Therefore, of course, such questions related to controllability,

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
they are not very simple.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
As I said at the beginning of my story,

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
there is such a trick, tell about yourself for 10 minutes,

55:45.000 --> 55:51.000
and 80% of the candidates will not be silent in 10 minutes.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
There is another trick, tell about yourself in categories,

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
there was a situation, you held an event,

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
got some results.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
We give the candidate a statement that we are interested in the story,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
in such categories.

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
Surprisingly, a huge number of candidates pretend that they do not hear these statements.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
Accordingly, it is difficult to talk about their controllability.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
A good question to clarify the controllability is,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
how do you think, are you successful?

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
Let's say, a sales manager, a topic close to me.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Are you a successful seller?

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
And listen carefully to what the candidate tells us.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
What signals of danger can cause our tension here?

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
The candidate only says that he decided so.

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
I think so, I am sure of it, I see my results.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
If he says all the time that he is confident in his success,

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
because this is his knowledge,

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
then this is a signal that this candidate is not very controllable.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
And the last category in our matrix,

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
wants, can, is controlled, is safe, is security.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
The last in line, but not the last in significance.

57:06.000 --> 57:11.000
Especially today, when alcoholism and drug addiction have become the reality of our day.

57:11.000 --> 57:18.000
Determining security is a complex and extremely important thing when evaluating a candidate.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
What is security?

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
This is the ability to solve problems with the candidate

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
in a conflict situation in the system of employee-employee.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
And also, how much the future employee can control his actions, speech,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
that is, what we usually call his adequacy.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
Before talking about how to determine the security of the candidate in an interview,

57:40.000 --> 57:47.000
you need to look at what signs of an unsafe candidate may be.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
The first sign is that the candidate comes to the company with his database

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
and considers it a serious competitive advantage.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
You need to understand that after some time,

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
having worked in your company, if you have taken such a candidate,

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
he will go to a new employer with a new database.

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
Of course, in an interview, the candidate is always respected.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
For example, I suggest that you go to a competing company,

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
they answer as follows.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
You know, they say, I worked very well in my company.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
I know all its pros and cons.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
And everything was going well.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
The fact that I want to move does not mean that I want to damage my company.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
This, of course, always causes respect and trust for such a candidate.

58:37.000 --> 58:45.000
In addition, I always warn my clients who ask to find them specialists from competing companies.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
Simple questions that I ask.

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
Please tell me, if this person leaves his company and goes to you,

58:54.000 --> 58:59.000
what motive does he have, except for a very high salary that you offer him?

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
And what can he do tomorrow in your company?

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
And where will he go with your database?

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
Therefore, the question of the database is very serious,

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
which requires special attention when interviewing with a candidate.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
The second point.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
The candidate does not respond well to his employer.

59:19.000 --> 59:23.000
Of course, it is very difficult to talk about a company in good words,

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
where an unnormative lexicon was adopted,

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
where the manager allowed himself, for example, to throw ashtrays at his subordinates,

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
or where there is an official six-day working week.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
This, by the way, exists today.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
But it all depends on how the candidate talks about it,

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
how he behaves and what assessment he gives to what is happening.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Another alarming signal of an unsafe candidate

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
is the discovery of completely commercial information about the company.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
Without asking questions, he suddenly begins to talk about the fact that

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the company has been rejected, how much they are being done and to whom.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
He talks about the people interested in a company,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
about projects that may have been asked by clients and not to name.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
This is always a serious signal of the danger of the candidate.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Of course, information that the company has adopted a gray form of payment

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
is also not a very good signal.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Another signal that I would like to mention is

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000
if a candidate suddenly says that he is ready to leave his current job

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and move to a new one within two days.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Of course, the question arises, what kind of specialist is he,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
who can really leave his job within two days?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
What kind of project is he leading?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And what is the situation in the company when this can happen?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Most likely, this person either no longer works

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and just talks about being in the company,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
or he is already in the dismissal stage,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and he really ends his work.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
We definitely do not conclude that this candidate is dangerous and does not suit us.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But of course, this is a topic for discussion.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Another topic that must always be clarified is

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000
if a candidate suddenly agrees to a sharp reduction in his position or salary.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.000
For example, a person was a manager of a sales department or a commercial director,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and suddenly he agrees to the position of key account manager.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
There can be completely objective reasons.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
For example, a person came from the region to Moscow

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and, of course, it is not very correct and almost impossible to count on the same high position as he had there.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And then a person chooses such a path for himself

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
that he goes to the company for a lower position,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
but he absolutely understands that after a while,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
with his hard work and implemented projects, he will prove his worth.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Such people are visible right away, they talk about it.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Or, for example, a person was a commercial director in a small structure,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
and he goes to a very large structure with a reduction.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Then you can also understand that the experience of a small business and the experience of a large business are completely different things.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And his motivation for transition is clear.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
If there is no such motivation, this is a topic to be surprised.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Why, all of a sudden, what did not work out in the company?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
What are the reasons? What are the problems? What are the conflicts that force a person to do so?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Of course, the point I was already talking about is an inadequate increase in salary compared to what is indicated in the resume.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
We read the resume and see that a person is considering a salary of, for example, 3 thousand.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
He comes to our interview and suddenly calls 5.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000
In this case, I always ask a very simple question, especially if the resume is not relevant, for example, 2 or 3 months ago.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I ask my candidates a question.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Please tell me what happened in your life that your market value has increased so much?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You received a super education, you participated in an incredibly complex and interesting project.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
What happened to you?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:21.000
The way a person reacts to my question and how he responds is a signal of his adequacy and correct perception of reality.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Another source of information about a candidate, as we all know, is a collection of recommendations.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
So, if a candidate blocks the receipt of recommendations in every possible way,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:43.000
motivating him not to want the information that he is looking for a job to go to the market, this is also a signal of tension.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Of course, we do not collect information and recommendations about a person who works in his current company.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Of course, this is not ethical and you do not need to create problems for the candidate.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
But why can't you get his recommendations from the previous job?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
It is completely incomprehensible.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Of course, we know that if a candidate indicates recommendations in a resume or calls them during an interview,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
then, most likely, these are the recommendations with which a certain agreement has been reached.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It must be said that now there is such a practice.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.000
If a candidate is very unsuccessful and a conflict has occurred, or he has not passed the probation period, or something else has happened,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and the company does not want to have problems with this candidate or does not have the formal ability to fire him,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
then there is such an agreement.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The candidate does not demand from the company any gold parachute, no compensation, nothing.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
He leaves peacefully, despite the fact that there was a conflict.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
The company, on its part, gives him good recommendations.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
As a rule, they are written.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
But we understand that written recommendations still make sense to recheck.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:06.000
The resume of this moment is that you should pay attention to how a person treats the ability to give recommendations.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Sometimes we ask them, even realizing that we will not call these recommenders, because the candidate is quite transparent.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
But the readiness of a person to call these people, the openness of information, the evidence that, in principle, he has nothing to be afraid of.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So, having determined all the signs of an unsafe candidate, the question arises, how can we understand this during an interview,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
if these are the signs that I just mentioned, still no.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
We need to talk.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Two techniques work very well here.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
The first is provocative questions.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
And the second is the stress interview technique.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I will say right away about the stress interview, because the usual maximum number of questions on evaluation techniques is related to the stress interview.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:02.000
For ethical reasons, a stress interview is an extreme measure that should not be carried out for no reason, without serious grounds.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Of course, if the candidate works in a very unfavorable environment, sometimes in another country, or in a state of strong psychological pressure,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
then a test at the stage of the stress interview can be useful.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
But you can't use this technology without knowing how to.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
The peculiarity of the correct stress technology is when the candidate is prepared for it.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Therefore, if there is a need to check his stress resistance, then you need to warn him that you will use the stress interview.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You need to warn him on what day and say whether you agree with this evaluation technology.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And after conducting a stress interview, the person needs to relax, thank him for agreeing to this procedure,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:58.000
that he was brave, that everything was fine, and that you had no personal complaints.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You didn't want to offend or insult him in any way.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Therefore, stress interviews should be conducted only in the most extreme cases when other evaluation technologies simply do not work.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
What can be attributed to stress issues?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It is not necessary to personally insult a person.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Most likely, this is an unacceptable thing, but it is often used.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
You can ask absolutely unpleasant work questions.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Again, from the same database.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
The question is, why are you sitting here with your database and not going to your competitors?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
This is a rather unpleasant question.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Probably, this is not quite stress, but nevertheless.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Or such a question.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The whole market is working on rollbacks, and you want to say that you are not working?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Well, tell me, tell me.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Such a question is more personal.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
You know, we have 15 excellent candidates on our vacancy.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Why did you decide that you have a chance to get this position?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Unpleasant questions.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:09.000
When we ask a candidate, if the candidate is adequate and safe, then most likely the reaction will be absolutely adequate.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
A person will either try to answer normally, he will not rush to shout, he will not insult each other,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
do not knock on the door, do not demand any compensation.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Most likely, this will be a normal, healthy reaction.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It is good if a person can joke and somehow play this situation.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But, of course, you should not expect such a reaction.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:41.000
A much softer and probably a little less effective technique to determine a safe candidate is provocative questions.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:50.000
When a person, on the one hand, wants to show himself on the bright side and hide some things,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and on the other hand, he understands that if he starts to draw a little, it will be insincere and also quite obvious.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Therefore, provocative questions can be as follows.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
For example, do you consider a service romance permissible?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Again, the question I asked, why do not the employees steal?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
What serious failures at work happened to you?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Explain their reasons and how you got into them.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Also, questions to determine the safety of the candidate.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
For example, such a property.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Please tell me, are you an example for yourself?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Who are your role models?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Is it profitable to be in good relations with your colleagues or just with people?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Tell me, what could your employees accuse you of?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Not very comfortable questions that require a certain approach, disclosure and courage to answer these questions.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
So, we have analyzed all four categories of the matrix.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Want, can, safe, manage.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
How do we draw a conclusion about the candidate?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
The conclusion will be much easier if we structure all the information we have.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
It can be structured in the form of a table, in the form of some points.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:23.000
For example, I give two forms, this is for the choice, and everyone determines for himself how it is convenient for him to draw conclusions on the interview.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Maybe a summary of the candidates' table, which will include strong sides, weak sides, the possibilities of the candidate and threats.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Under each item, it is signed what we understood about the candidate.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:50.000
If we work on the matrix, want, can, manage, safe, then this is the same table in which we write down why the candidate wants, what he can, manage and safe.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Once again, I want to draw your attention to the fact that at least one is not, and the candidate does not suit us.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But if we put the interview results in the table and argue each decision, then at the end we have a very clear assessment of the candidate.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
For example, the candidate does not fit because he does not have enough motivation.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
We talk about the category wants and write that the only motivation of the candidate is to get a white salary.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
This is clearly not enough for a person to be hired.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Or, for example, the category can. We write that the candidate does not fit because he has no experience of successful sales, or, in principle, his sales experience is not enough to solve our tasks.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:47.000
We do not manage. Again, the argument is that he left the previous job because he had continuous conflicts with his boss and he could not agree.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And it is safe, respectively, that the candidate is not safe because he came from his database and he has a very frequent change of work.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
He does not work in one place for more than one year.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Naturally, filling in this table, we think over the results of our interview.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
We get an absolutely logical, structured and justified answer.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
If the candidate suits us, we can always say why.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:26.000
If the candidate does not suit us, we say exactly why he does not fit and give feedback to the staff for another search, for a corrector.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
So, I want to summarize what we get.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Each interview that we conduct with a candidate must be prepared and structured.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:44.000
In this case, it is very easy to evaluate the candidate and compare several candidates to the same position.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:58.000
If we ask questions that fit into the system of whether we want to manage it or not, we will not ask questions that do not bring us any information load or that we simply cannot interpret.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I will give you some examples. Sometimes we ask a question that we think will show the intellectual level of the candidate.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And we say to him, please tell me what you read.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And the candidate answers us, I read Spanish literature.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Or, because of a lack of time, I read books in English.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Please tell us what this gives us to determine his professional skills or to determine his safety.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Therefore, when interviewing a candidate, you need to prepare.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Traditionally, it is believed that you need to ask 20 key questions and 2-3 clarifying questions for each question.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000
The time it takes to answer these 20 questions will take up to 1.5 hours.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000
But at the end of the interview, we get very clear information.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I have a suggestion that can be designed as follows.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
A table of three columns.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.000
In the first column, we describe the characteristics that we want to understand from the candidate.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
For example, the category can.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:12.000
We learn professional experience, results, achievements, projects, and also those personal qualities that are included in this characteristic.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Ability to negotiate, convincing communication, independence, determination, and so on.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
The second part is all the characteristics that belong to the category wants.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
These are true motivators.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000
This is readiness to work in a team, to work in this company, to accept its cultural values, and so on.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Manageability and safety are what we have already talked about.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Manageability, for example, for a company, readiness for overtime work.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
This is also managability, how much a person is ready to accept this system.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Readiness to fly on a business trip, to study in a short time, and so on.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And safety.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
His adequate behavior during an interview, his reaction to provocative questions.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
We got this.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000
In the second column, near each question, we make short notes on the candidate's answer.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
First, we will not forget this at the end of the interview or the next day.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Secondly, this will give us an understanding of his compliance with what we require.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And in the third column, when we analyze the interview, we put the scores.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The scores can be in a system that is convenient for you.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
For some, it is convenient from minus 2, it is very bad, up to plus 2 is very good.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
For some, a 5-point system is convenient, adopted at school.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
For some, a 10-point system is convenient.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
The system is variable, but whatever the assessment system we adopted,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
at the end of our table, we will definitely get a certain numerical answer.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And if we have 3, 4 or 5 candidates for this vacancy,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
then we can easily compare the numerical answers,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
understand which candidate is the best for us.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And the task for us is to find the best, the most suitable,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
the most consistent with our requirements and our vacancy.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Thank you for your attention.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I wish you success in such a difficult matter as selection and assessment of staff.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And I really hope that only the most suitable, the most suitable and the most correct employees will work in your company.
