00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Good day, dear colleagues.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I am Oleg Yevgenievich Boksansky,

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Professor of the Russian Academy of Economics of the Plekhanov family.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
The topic of our meeting today is the analysis of perception and control of sensations.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
A person lives in a sea of information all the time.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
We constantly hear something, see something, pay attention to something,

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
highlight what interests us, formulate any aspects of this perception,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
engage in interaction, communication with other people,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
and receive feedback from this interaction.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Naturally, the questions of perception are very interesting,

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
and psychologists paid a lot of attention to them

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
in order to understand how the perception of information happens,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
what contributes to the perception of information,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
what prevents the perception of information.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
We will divide the acquaintance with perception into two main parts.

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
First, we will talk a little about what perception as a psychological phenomenon is,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
and then, during the main time of our interaction,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
we will analyze what social perception is.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Because the perception of information and the perception of information from other people,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
the perception of other people, the perception of interaction with other people

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
are two different disciplines that have their own laws,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
have their own patterns.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
They are closely interconnected, of course,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
and we will look at this in more detail.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
What are sensations?

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Psychologists define sensations as a kind of initial processes

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
of perception of different objects of the surrounding world.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
A person has several main sensory systems.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
First of all, this is the visual system, that is, our vision.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
Through the vision, we receive about 90% of all the information that surrounds us.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
And the auditory system, or hearing.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
As for hearing, this is also a very important system for a person.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
And we receive about 8-9% of the information that comes to us from the surrounding world.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And the third system is the kinesthetic system.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
This includes taste, smell, tactile sensations.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
Usually, for a person, this system is less important than the visual and auditory system.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
And traditionally, we receive useful information from it, not more than 1-2%.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
It is worth paying attention to the fact that all these percentages are statistical values.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Naturally, if a person is blind,

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
then he receives more than 80% of information about the surrounding world through hearing.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
The rest, 10-15%, are related to the kinesthetic system.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Depending on the conditions we find ourselves in,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
depending on how our sensory organs function,

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
how well they work, depending on the needs that are presented to us,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
we will include certain sensory systems.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
The data I mentioned regarding the hearing and kinesthetic vision

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
are the averaged values that we usually use in our everyday life,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
when interacting with other people,

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
when working, when analyzing, when searching, when considering certain problems.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
But we must pay attention to the fact that

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
the sensations themselves are the simplest elements of obtaining information from the surrounding world.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
If we look at the surrounding world, we see flowers,

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
cars, people, and those or that figures.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
But we do not perceive them separately, we perceive them in the system.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
Perceiving the elements individually is something that exists only in the laboratory environment,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
in our everyday life.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
We perceive the surrounding world as a holistic system.

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
That is why psychologists usually say that if the sensations are the initial, primitive process of analyzing information,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
then the perception is already a kind of a combination of sensations

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
that are based on our previous experience

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
and give a person an idea of what he sees, what he interacts with,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
and gives him a certain picture of reality in which he can orient himself.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Again, if we find ourselves on the street,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
we perceive a huge number of elements,

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
but we only select those elements that are important to us now.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
A traffic light, the presence of cars, the presence of a crossing,

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
that is, those elements that we need specifically for our actions, to cross the road.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
This is how it happens all the time in our life.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Depending on the tasks that lie ahead of us,

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
we focus and direct our perception to those or other aspects

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
that suit us in terms of solving those tasks that lie ahead of us.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
In other words, we can say that perception is a conscious process of analyzing information

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
that comes to us from the surrounding world,

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
and this very perception is a kind of organizing of the elementary sensations

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
that come to us from our senses.

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
Scientists analyzed the human ability to perceive from different points of view,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
and several different theories were proposed

06:09.000 --> 06:19.000
that would try to explain how our consciousness perceives those or other phenomena of the surrounding world.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Let's briefly discuss these approaches,

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
because they will come in handy later when we try to analyze and understand social perception.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
The perception that we are talking about now is the most general approach.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
The main topic that we will focus on in the future will be social perception, as we have already mentioned,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
that is, the interaction of people with each other.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
And here we will need the theories that we will mention now.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
The first theory of perception was actually created by Wilhelm Wundt,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
the founder of psychology at the end of the 19th century.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
Wundt came to the conclusion that our perception is an analysis of elementary sensations.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
We see different kinds of elements, we perceive them separately,

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
and then we try to bring these elements into some structure

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
in order to understand what kind of whole image is hidden behind them.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
For example, when we look at a traffic light, we see three signals there,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
red, yellow, green.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
These signals are in certain devices,

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
and by perceiving all these signals, we gradually assess for ourselves that this is a traffic light.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
That is, perception is a decomposition of elements.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
This was the very first approach that was used for the analysis of perception.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
This approach turned out to be very fruitful,

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
but, of course, the further and the more we analyzed and studied the problem of perception,

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
it became clear that it was not so simple from the point of view of the analysis of the work of our psyche

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
on the perception of different kinds of information.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
The main question that remained unclear was how we can perceive the whole system,

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
how we can distinguish different elements from the same images.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Different people see the same objects,

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
but different people in the same objects pay attention to different elements.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
How does this happen?

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
On what basis do we distinguish certain nuances of the image?

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
At the beginning of the 20th century,

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
an entire field of psychology, which was called Gestalt psychology,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
began to respond to this question.

08:45.000 --> 08:54.000
As for Gestalt psychology, it was engaged in the analysis of sensations and perceptions.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
Gestaltists fundamentally disagreed with structuralists and said that

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
no matter how many elementary sensations we study,

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
we will never be able to make a holistic image out of these elementary sensations.

09:11.000 --> 09:19.000
Our psyche does not work just like a camera that captures certain approaches,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
certain images, certain pictures.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Our psyche is something more.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
The Gestaltists' motto was that the whole is not the sum of its components.

09:31.000 --> 09:42.000
That is, if we take an object and start to distinguish its color, shape, mass, size,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
its location relative to other objects,

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
we still will not be able to determine what kind of object it is.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
Psychology works a little more difficultly than structuralism.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Gestaltists proposed their own approach to perception.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
The term Gestalt is a translation of the German term.

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
It is something holistic, something fundamental, something indisputable.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
Gestaltists came to the conclusion that when we perceive any object or phenomenon,

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
we distinguish the basic elements of the Gestalt,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
which are perceived and assessed by our nervous system,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
and it is these elements that are recognized.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
A little later, when we talk about specific Gestalt approaches,

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
we will focus on the factors that the Gestaltists distinguished.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
But despite all the successes that Gestalt psychology has achieved,

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
it has achieved great success because all the laws of perception and sensations

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
that were discovered by Gestalt psychologists have found their confirmation,

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
and today they are included in the Golden Fund of Psychological Knowledge without raising any questions.

11:12.000 --> 11:21.000
Nevertheless, the Gestalt approach was still unable to analyze and assess all the nuances of perception.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Of course, new theoretical ideas were proposed,

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
which tried to explain the problem of perception sensations

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
with a wider spectrum than both structuralists and Gestaltists.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
The next approach is the one that was named constructivism.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
As for constructivism, it is again the 1920s and 1930s,

11:48.000 --> 11:56.000
and the constructivists came to the conclusion that the main thing we need to start from is experience.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
Our nervous system, our psyche, works with empirical data.

12:01.000 --> 12:12.000
Therefore, perception is not just an analysis of the irritant that affects our retina,

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
our ears, or our kinesthetic organs.

12:17.000 --> 12:27.000
Perception is a kind of interpretation of these processes,

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
and the signals of the outside world affect our vision, hearing, and kinesthetics.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Then the brain interprets the result of this effect

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
and tries to construct what we saw based on the irritant analysis.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
What colors were there, what shape was there, what background objects were there.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
It tries to construct the picture that affected our senses.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
For some people, this reconstruction is successful, for others it is less successful.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
But again, depending on our interpretations,

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
we are more or less successful in terms of analyzing the objects that affect us.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
We can say that the constructivist approach was very popular in the second half of the 20th century.

13:25.000 --> 13:38.000
It was able to answer many questions that were not solved by structuralists or representatives of Gestalt psychology.

13:39.000 --> 13:48.000
Nevertheless, this approach found its critics and opponents

13:48.000 --> 13:58.000
who believed that perception and sensations should not be considered as complex cognitive processes.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
Thinking is a complex cognitive process, and intellect is an even more complex process.

14:03.000 --> 14:12.000
As for perception, it is the most basic stage of the work of our psyche, and it should not be deliberately complicated.

14:12.000 --> 14:25.000
The main proponent of this idea, including the researcher who did a lot to justify this point of view, was James Gibson.

14:26.000 --> 14:35.000
In the middle of the last century, he was the founder of the ecological approach to perception.

14:35.000 --> 14:45.000
As for Gibson's ecological approach to perception, he understood the word ecology in a somewhat different sense than we understand ecology today.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Gibson came to the conclusion that when we look at the world around us,

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
there is enough information in this world for us to be able to perceive what we see.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
We assess the location of objects relative to each other.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
We assess the texture of the surface.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
It is rough, flexible, smooth.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
We assess colors, shapes, and figures.

15:14.000 --> 15:29.000
And this is enough for us to get complete information about what surrounds us without any cognitive interpretation processes, as the constructivists said.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
At the same time, Gibson concluded that if we take the same vision,

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
and as for the vision, all his research was mainly devoted to the visual system,

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
then the vision is present in different representatives of the animal world,

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
which we cannot see due to the large and advanced consciousness.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
And yet, they are well-oriented in this world.

15:55.000 --> 16:05.000
Ants, bees, that is, the simplest living organisms that do not have a developed brain,

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
but yet vision plays a big role in their lives.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
If we follow the point of view of the constructivists,

16:12.000 --> 16:24.000
then we will not be able to understand how they can so successfully orient themselves with the help of the vision of the simplest representatives of the animal world.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
After all, if we go from the point of view of the constructivists,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
then the constructivists necessarily assume the presence of a fairly developed psyche.

16:32.000 --> 16:44.000
And Gibson emphasized that since these simplest living organisms are able to perceive all the objects that are important to them,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
and are able to survive,

16:47.000 --> 17:00.000
then this is evidence that the whole world carries enough information for this information to be perceived and assessed.

17:00.000 --> 17:08.000
And here neither experience nor any buildings are needed.

17:08.000 --> 17:21.000
If there are external stimuli that act on the retina, the eye, receptors, perception,

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
then this is more than enough to perceive these phenomena.

17:26.000 --> 17:39.000
Gibson's ecological approach was very fruitful from the point of view that when they began to try to model human perception,

17:39.000 --> 17:50.000
then quite large successes were achieved with the help of this approach from the point of view of analysis and perception of the surrounding world.

17:51.000 --> 18:00.000
But, of course, not all researchers agreed with this ecological approach.

18:00.000 --> 18:10.000
And, accordingly, they continued to look for new ideas from the point of view of perception analysis.

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
The next approach that was developed was developed by David Marr and was called the information approach.

18:17.000 --> 18:27.000
David Marr tried to return to the ideas of structuralism and combine them with the approach of Gibson.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
Marr was based on the fact that all the external stimuli that exist in the surrounding world,

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
they really contain enough information for us to interpret them, to make them meaningful.

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
But, as for Marr, he thought about what are the elementary elements.

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
He wanted to highlight those elementary elements of objects, those elementary elements of structures that exist in this world.

18:55.000 --> 19:05.000
And his success was that he managed to highlight the elements of texture that exist in this world

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
and that are able to be reflected in our psyche.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
Lines, segments, angles, all kinds of contours, movements, other signs.

19:16.000 --> 19:25.000
David Marr's approach was very successful, again, due to the fact that Marr was engaged in computer science.

19:25.000 --> 19:35.000
His task was to model the perception of those or other external objects using electronic computing.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
In this case, it was about the recognition of the same text.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
And the successes that we all face, for example, FineReader and other programs,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
are largely attributed to David Marr.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
It is not mentioned very often, but in fact, it was Marr who was the founder

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
who laid the foundations for all modern text recognition.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
Marr's approach was a really informational approach and a technical approach,

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
because it allowed to identify those elements of external structures

20:10.000 --> 20:17.000
that are necessary and sufficient to be perceived and recognized by our psyche.

20:17.000 --> 20:26.000
As the success of human brain recognition increased,

20:26.000 --> 20:34.000
researchers began to develop a new approach, which was called neurophysiological.

20:34.000 --> 20:45.000
As for Marr, he was engaged in perception regardless of the senses, regardless of the functioning of the brain.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
But as for the researchers of the end of the 20th century,

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
they already came from the fact that it was necessary to find a connection between those or other parts of the brain

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
and their perception of various objects.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
On the one hand, it was another return to structuralism,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
but only at a more advanced level,

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
connected with great successes achieved from the point of view of psychology and neuropsychology.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
Brain areas were identified that were responsible for the perception of various objects,

21:25.000 --> 21:34.000
that were responsible for the perception of movement, tilt, those or other angles, those or other forms.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
And, accordingly, they tried to create a definite correspondence.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
What cells are activated from the point of view of external stimuli?

21:43.000 --> 21:51.000
Again, as for this approach, it has already begun to develop in close connection with the creation of the theory of artificial intelligence,

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
because the perception of information is the first initial stage from which information begins to work.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
And after perceiving this information, we can focus on it,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
we can turn to memory and compare it.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
We see a new object, or this object is similar to something.

22:07.000 --> 22:16.000
We can build different kinds of mental images, and then build logical figures, and so on, based on the perceived material.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
The modern state of this approach is, in fact, the creation of cognitive neurology.

22:22.000 --> 22:32.000
As for cognitive neurology, it tries to explain the physiological foundations of the theory of perception.

22:32.000 --> 22:42.000
Cognitive neurology consists of the fact that the perception of information is the very first initial stage of working with it.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
Then, after the perception of this information, the recognition of the perceived occurs.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Here we already see a close intersection with constructivism.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
We have perceived this or that information, and now we begin to recognize it.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
What did we perceive? How useful is this information for us?

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
How new and old is this information for us?

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
After this recognition of information, we focus our attention on everything that we have perceived.

23:13.000 --> 23:22.000
From all perceived objects, all figures, sounds, elements, our sensations, we perceive what we are really interested in.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
For example, a phone call, if we are waiting for it.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
For example, a time signal, if we are waiting for lunch.

23:31.000 --> 23:40.000
We focus our attention on those elements, those components, those circumstances that we need, depending on our needs and capabilities.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
After we have focused our attention on something, we turn to our memory.

23:46.000 --> 23:57.000
How much do we perceive the objects, events, facts, new and old, what do they mean, what should we be ready for, what should we expect?

23:57.000 --> 24:04.000
After we have turned to our memory, we can already build different kinds of mental images.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
We are able to represent information.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Everyone does it in their own way.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
Someone represents information in a more visual way.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
It is those or other pictures, those or other colors, shapes.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
Someone perceives information more often by hearing.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
He perceives where and when he heard it.

24:28.000 --> 24:35.000
Where and with what sensations, from the point of view of hearing perception, it is connected.

24:36.000 --> 24:44.000
There are people who prefer to recall those or other sensations that are connected to them, depending on this information.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Tactile sensations.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Are they painful, pleasant, tense?

24:49.000 --> 24:58.000
As for our perception, about 60-70% of people think visually.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Again, these are statistical data.

25:01.000 --> 25:13.000
But it is necessary to keep them in mind, because depending on how a person prefers to represent information, we will have to build our interaction with this person.

25:13.000 --> 25:23.000
About 20-25% of people prefer to represent information in a hearing form.

25:23.000 --> 25:31.000
About 10-15% of people think visually.

25:31.000 --> 25:42.000
If we want to communicate with different people and we want them to understand us, we must consider a typical way of presenting information.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
We will talk about this in more detail later.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
What conclusion can be drawn from this set of different approaches to perception?

25:52.000 --> 26:00.000
Each of the concepts considered is somehow successful, in some ways it is less successful.

26:00.000 --> 26:12.000
And most likely, if we really want to understand how the perception process is implemented, we should take into account the approaches of these different theories.

26:13.000 --> 26:27.000
At the same time, it is very often useful to consider the patterns of perception that were identified by the Gestalt psychology.

26:27.000 --> 26:36.000
When we talk about social perception, it is necessary to keep in mind that we never perceive a person just like that.

26:36.000 --> 26:48.000
We perceive a person based on the background of other people, we perceive a person based on his activities, we perceive a person based on the feedback that we have about this person.

26:48.000 --> 26:58.000
And in fact, our opinion about a person, our attitude to him is formed on the basis of many factors that need to be taken into account.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
From the point of view of perception, these factors were analyzed and considered by the Gestalt psychologist.

27:07.000 --> 27:15.000
Let's stop at these factors now, and then, when we move on to social perception, we will take them into account.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Basically, these factors are presented on the slide.

27:18.000 --> 27:29.000
As we have already said, and I will often emphasize this, because this is really a basic idea of perception, we do not perceive factors separately.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
We perceive factors as a whole picture, in their interrelationship with each other.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Therefore, the first factor of perception is the factor of proximity.

27:38.000 --> 27:49.000
It indicates that objects located close to each other tend to be perceived as part of something as a whole.

27:49.000 --> 27:56.000
And, accordingly, this is necessary to keep in mind when we create a certain perception.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
When we see a person for the first time, we see how he is dressed, we see how he behaves, we see how he walks.

28:03.000 --> 28:13.000
And on the basis of all these factors directly related to the object we are interested in, we form our initial idea.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
The next factor is the factor of similarity.

28:17.000 --> 28:25.000
It is that we strive to group elements according to some general groups.

28:25.000 --> 28:34.000
In this regard, if we perceive many objects, then the fact of being perceived has, first of all, objects that we are already familiar with.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
New objects are, accordingly, unexpected for us.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
We do not know how to compare them, and therefore we kind of postpone their perception a little later.

28:45.000 --> 28:56.000
But we perceive those objects, those elements that we are already familiar with and that we know how to relate to.

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
The next factor is the so-called factor of good continuation.

29:03.000 --> 29:11.000
We always try to perceive objects located on one line or forming a particular figure.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
A triangle, a square, a rectangle.

29:15.000 --> 29:23.000
Because what concerns the images that arise in our psyche, they strive to be economic.

29:23.000 --> 29:33.000
And, accordingly, instead of taking many different objects located in different elements, it is easier to create a certain single image.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
On the basis of which we can already draw conclusions about what we have perceived.

29:37.000 --> 29:49.000
By the way, this factor of good continuation finds its implementation in the so-called mnemonic rules, that is, the rules for memory.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
We remember objects, trying to bind them to well-known other objects.

29:55.000 --> 30:04.000
Many elements of the analysis of our cognitive system, our memory, come from this factor.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
The next factor is the so-called factor of common fate.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
Please note that in this case such common names are used.

30:13.000 --> 30:23.000
And this is not surprising, because what concerns the Gestalt psychologists, they, in turn, came from the fact that we do not need to use all kinds of big scientific terms.

30:24.000 --> 30:34.000
If we are talking about the simplest objects, about the perception, the Gestalt psychologists considered one of the simplest functions of our psyche, then we must speak in simple words.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
We must use metaphors, we must use analogies.

30:37.000 --> 30:51.000
And as for the factor of common fate, in this case, it means that the idea that, if, for example, we have a number of moving objects,

30:51.000 --> 30:59.000
and we see some other objects, first of all, we will perceive those objects that move in the same direction as others.

30:59.000 --> 31:07.000
We will not pay attention, initially, to those elements, those details that stand out.

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
We first try to organize, systematize, generalize the whole set of perceived objects.

31:15.000 --> 31:22.000
Our psyche is so arranged that we try to find some standards everywhere, to find some common approaches everywhere.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.000
Because there are a lot of objects for perception.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
And we cannot perceive all these objects.

31:32.000 --> 31:42.000
As psychologists proved, a person can work with a family of plus or minus two objects at the same time.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
That is, we can work at the same time with five to nine objects.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
This is called the Miller number, because it was Miller who justified this number experimentally.

31:55.000 --> 32:08.000
And, accordingly, the idea is that a person at the same time cannot consciously grasp more than nine elements.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
Again, this is a statistical idea.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Someone can grasp eight, someone eleven, someone twelve.

32:17.000 --> 32:27.000
But the statistics are that at the same time, consciousness can focus not more than on nine objects, from five to nine.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
Of course, you can do special exercises and develop this volume of perception.

32:31.000 --> 32:38.000
But physiologically, we have five or nine objects with whom we can work at the same time.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
The next fact that was highlighted by the psychologists in terms of perception is the factor of symmetry.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
Again, I think that here we will all agree that it is easier for us to perceive symmetrical objects.

32:50.000 --> 33:00.000
We just need less information in order to perceive those elements that have a certain general structure.

33:00.000 --> 33:08.000
If there is symmetry, then, accordingly, you can highlight a certain general element, which is then focused in different directions.

33:08.000 --> 33:15.000
Again, in this regard, we can talk about the next factor closely related to the first one.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
This is the closedness factor.

33:17.000 --> 33:25.000
The fact is that if we have many objects for perception, then we try to group them

33:25.000 --> 33:32.000
and perceive those elements that are closest to each other.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
That is, we form a closed figure.

33:35.000 --> 33:45.000
Just because a closed figure is a kind of border that is placed on objects and makes it possible to perceive them as a whole group.

33:45.000 --> 33:53.000
The next element, the next factor of gestalt perception, is the so-called factor of one-type connection.

33:54.000 --> 34:04.000
This is the fact that if we highlight a certain pattern, a certain connection, the simplest one,

34:04.000 --> 34:14.000
for example, all objects of the same dark color, all objects of the same oval shape, all objects of the same complex shape,

34:14.000 --> 34:23.000
then, having highlighted this common connection, we begin to perceive those objects that this connection is suitable for.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
In fact, having highlighted a certain element, we create a filter for ourselves.

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
And through this filter, the perception points, we look at those elements that satisfy this filter.

34:35.000 --> 34:45.000
The next element, the factor of perception, characteristic of the human psychology, is the so-called law of pregnancy or the law of good shape.

34:51.000 --> 34:58.000
If we see, for example, some kind of punctured figure, then we always perceive it as something holistic.

34:58.000 --> 35:06.000
We will not say that this is a set of punctures, we will say that this is either a rectangle or a square.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
And we can see examples of this on the slide.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
These are the main factors of gestalt perception that were highlighted by gestalt psychologists.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
These factors continue to open, modify, generalize.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
But perhaps these are the original data that we will need later.

35:27.000 --> 35:35.000
For now, this will be enough for us to understand the aspects of social perception that occur here.

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
So, we have considered the general approaches to perception, which try to describe the process of perception inherent in any person.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
The main problem of perception

35:54.000 --> 36:01.000
But perhaps the greatest interest for us now will be to present the problem of perception of people to each other.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
We, a person, are constantly interacting with other people.

36:05.000 --> 36:19.000
We are friends with someone, we work with someone, we relax with someone, we quarrel with someone, we get into a conflict with someone, we express our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with someone.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
A person is a social being, always interacting with other people.

36:23.000 --> 36:29.000
In this regard, the main quality inherent in a person is communication.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Communication with other people.

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
When we communicate, it starts with perception.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
We must perceive the person we are communicating with.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
And this perception, as you understand, is not a visual perception, to recognize a person.

36:48.000 --> 36:55.000
This perception is connected and carries with it the whole loop that this person calls us.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
What do we know about him?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
What relations we had with him before?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
What problems we had with him?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Can we rely on him?

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Should we avoid communicating with him?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
And so on.

37:07.000 --> 37:13.000
When we talk about communication, three main elements are usually highlighted in communication.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
First of all, it is communication.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That is, we directly exchange information.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
Why do we interact with another person?

37:20.000 --> 37:30.000
We interact with another person in order to learn something, to share something, to get some consultations, and so on.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
This is the informational side of communication.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
The other side of communication is interaction.

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
Already when we greet a person, when we greet him, we engage in interaction.

37:43.000 --> 37:51.000
We see another person, we show those or that signs, another person reacts to us, we enter into some kind of contact, some kind of interaction.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
We are constantly in contact with other people.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Whatever we do, whatever we do,

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
the very fact that another person enters our field of vision and we enter the field of vision of another person

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
is already a sign that the process of interaction has begun.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
We smiled, we walked by, we pretended not to recognize each other.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
We asked something.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
This is the interaction that begins between us.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
And the third side is perception.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
We perceived a person.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
We took those or other steps towards him, steps away from him.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
We made our opinion, our idea about this person.

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
And, accordingly, we either want to continue interacting with this person,

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
or we will be sure that we can get the information we need from this person,

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
the information we need about the work, the information we need in our personal life, and so on.

38:49.000 --> 38:56.000
Thus, before we start communicating, we must perceive another person and realize

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
how pleasant it will be for us to communicate with this person.

39:01.000 --> 39:08.000
This is where the elements of perception arise, or what constructivism is talking about.

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
Very often we experience what is called an indomitable feeling of attraction to a person.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
We cannot even explain to ourselves why it exists.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Nevertheless, this is a problem of perception.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
We perceived this person.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
He reminded us of someone.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Or he caused pleasant memories for us.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
And we want to continue communicating with him.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
On the other hand, we do not know the person yet, we imagined him,

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
and we already have negative impressions about him.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
We cannot explain to ourselves why this is so.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
We cannot understand what is happening, how it is happening.

39:44.000 --> 39:51.000
We will not open up to others, and we will strive to turn away from communicating with this person.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
How? Why does this happen?

39:54.000 --> 40:00.000
After all, all these questions are very important, especially in business.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
We go to negotiations.

40:02.000 --> 40:09.000
We see the person we will negotiate with, depending on how we build our relationship with this person.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Depending on whether we like him, depending on what we know about him.

40:13.000 --> 40:20.000
We already have certain expectations of whether the negotiations will be successful,

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
whether it is worth conducting them, whether we want to conduct them, how to conduct them.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
Conduct them from the point of view of cooperation, from the point of view of competition.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Conduct them aggressively, conduct them constructively.

40:32.000 --> 40:40.000
Accordingly, when we build social interaction, our task is to understand

40:41.000 --> 40:49.000
how we can achieve the desired perception of us, the person we are negotiating with,

40:49.000 --> 40:55.000
and accordingly, if we are conducting negotiations, how we can perceive a person without negativity,

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
without prejudice, in order to conduct a constructive agreement,

40:59.000 --> 41:06.000
to separate objective circumstances from subjective preferences.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It is a very difficult task.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
I have no doubt that each of you has encountered this many times in your activities.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
We made mistakes, we made the right actions.

41:17.000 --> 41:24.000
Can we clarify those elements of perception that are fair

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
and, on the contrary, avoid wrong ideas?

41:27.000 --> 41:33.000
If we did not like a person, we did not work with him, we did not interact with him,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
and he turned out to be a very good specialist, and our opinion was wrong,

41:37.000 --> 41:48.000
we made wrong actions, which may later affect our actions as businessmen.

41:48.000 --> 41:55.000
These are lost benefits, these are unfulfilled projects, these are wasted funds.

41:56.000 --> 42:05.000
Scientists, of course, very often and a lot, analyze the problem of social perception,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
that is, the perception of people by each other,

42:08.000 --> 42:15.000
precisely because it is of such an important importance for our everyday activities.

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
Many different approaches, many different concepts were proposed,

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
which would try to explain the perception that is happening.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
We will not dwell on them.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
Today we will talk only about the causal theory of the Garland-Kelley attribution.

42:34.000 --> 42:40.000
Just because this concept has received a very good experimental justification.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
It is relatively simple and it is viable,

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
because the ideas, the aspects that are embedded in it, which are implemented in it,

42:49.000 --> 42:54.000
are the aspects that we face in our constant communication.

42:54.000 --> 43:01.000
The attribution is, in fact, the reason,

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
and the causal attribution literally means attributing reasons.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
As for Garland-Kelley, he noticed that when people interact with each other,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
even without sufficient reasons,

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
they already come to different conclusions about the actions of another person,

43:23.000 --> 43:29.000
about why he does something, why he does something, what he wants to get in the end.

43:29.000 --> 43:35.000
When we communicate, we always want to know the motives of the actions of another person.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
And we are so arranged that, right or wrong,

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
based on reliable information, based on unreliable information,

43:44.000 --> 43:54.000
we build for ourselves an idea of why a person behaves in one way or another.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
We attribute the reasons for his behavior.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
At the same time, of course, very often we cannot ask another person

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
whether we are explaining his behavior to ourselves correctly.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
And all our subsequent interaction with him, subsequent communication,

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
subsequent communication, we build on the basis of these reasons.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
If we attribute them correctly, our communication turns out to be successful,

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
or we are able to avoid negativity towards us from the side of this person.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
But, unfortunately, often the situation arises

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
when we make mistakes in the reasons that we attribute.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
And thus we behave completely inadequately,

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
because a person cannot understand where the aggression comes from.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
After all, it seems that he has not taken any action,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
it seems that he has not yet had time to say anything,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
and we are already aggressive.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
In fact, for some reason we think that this person is facing a Taliban threat.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
And if the threat arises, we are naturally preparing to respond to it.

45:01.000 --> 45:10.000
Gerald Kelly, of course, was not the first to study the theory of attribution of reasons,

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
but the results he received, the research he received, the school he created

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
had a very big impact on the entire social psychology.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
This is one thing, but on the other hand,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Gerald Kelly was engaged in the advertising aspects.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
And the results he received were very successful in business processes,

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
in negotiations, in interaction with clients, in the theory of sales.

45:34.000 --> 45:41.000
Therefore, a large number of practical materials, practical trainings,

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
which are in demand, which are used in business, have been built on the theory of causal attribution.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
What are the main ideas of Gerald Kelly?

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
The first type of attribution that Kelly highlights is personal attribution,

45:55.000 --> 46:02.000
which is that a person commits an act,

46:02.000 --> 46:09.000
we see what he does, and try to explain the reasons for this act.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
For example, why does a person agree with everyone?

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Why does a person constantly argue with the leadership?

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
Why does a person constantly strive to prove his importance?

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
We see his behavioral aspects and try to explain to ourselves,

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
it is very important, depending on the reason for the behavior of a person,

46:31.000 --> 46:38.000
this includes what we expect from this person,

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
how we communicate with him, what impression he makes.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
Personal attribution is the most common attribution.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
If we see another person who does something,

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
the first thing that arises, we try to explain why he does it.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
Is he competent? Is he not competent?

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
Does he really know something?

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Either he is trying to attract our attention in some way,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
or he is trying to portray himself as who he is not.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
The second type of attribution that Kelly highlights is so-called object attribution.

47:14.000 --> 47:22.000
The thing is that a person's actions are always associated with some objects of the outside world.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
We are driving a car, we are speaking at some meeting,

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
we are sitting at some table,

47:33.000 --> 47:39.000
and, accordingly, a person's behavior is always directed at something,

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
including when we are negotiating as an object,

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
the opposite side is acting, the side with which we are negotiating.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
This is the object that our actions are directed to,

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
our manipulation, our influence, our interaction.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
And, of course, we are interested in understanding

48:02.000 --> 48:10.000
the possible causes of the action of the object of our interaction,

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
what to expect from it, and how to improve, correct, and optimize this interaction.

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
This is the object attribution when we try to understand

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
and assign the causes of the functioning of the object we interact with,

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
another person with whom we have this or that contact.

48:32.000 --> 48:38.000
And, finally, the third type of attribution is the circumstantial attribution.

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
The thing is that we always interact with another person,

48:43.000 --> 48:49.000
we always communicate, we always do something in certain conditions.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
We are surrounded by some facts and circumstances,

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
a lack of time, a lack of information, envy, ambition, career aspirations.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
Naturally, the interactions that occur do not occur in a vacuum,

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
as we have repeatedly said, they occur in the world,

49:08.000 --> 49:13.000
they occur among other people, they occur in a certain surrounding reality.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
And, accordingly, we strive to assign the meaning to these circumstances,

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
how much these circumstances interfere with or contribute to the achievement of certain actions,

49:25.000 --> 49:32.000
certain conditions, certain efforts, how useful they will be in the implementation of our plans,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
how much they will help me in the implementation of my aspirations,

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
and how much they will interfere with the implementation of certain tasks.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
The distinction of the three types of attribution, personal, object and circumstantial,

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
is very important because it reflects three circumstances that always exist.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
There is another person with whom I interact, there are circumstances of this interaction,

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
and there are reasons for this interaction,

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
which exist both on my side, on his side, and on the side of circumstances.

50:03.000 --> 50:09.000
As for the theory of attribution, Keller considered a lot of examples, a lot of circumstances,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
made a lot of summaries.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
And, in particular, one very important summary that he made,

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
even got a special name, as the Fundamental Mistake of Attribution.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
As for the Fundamental Mistake of Attribution, it got such a name for a reason,

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
because almost any of us makes this mistake.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
As for this approach, Keller paid attention to one obvious fact.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
I don't think that many of you will argue with me.

50:41.000 --> 50:47.000
Let's assume that we evaluate the successes of another person.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
It doesn't matter what kind of person he is, it doesn't matter what kind of relationship we have with him.

50:53.000 --> 51:01.000
The majority of people who will evaluate, explain, attribute the reason for the success to another person,

51:01.000 --> 51:13.000
will primarily look for the circumstances that helped the person achieve a certain result.

51:14.000 --> 51:24.000
They won't look for the reasons that are typical of a person, his knowledge, his efforts, his efforts.

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
They will primarily pay attention to the circumstances that surrounded him.

51:30.000 --> 51:36.000
And they will consider that this success is not due to the characteristics of a person,

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
no matter what kind of relationship we have with him,

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
but to the circumstances that helped him achieve a certain result.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
He was in the right place at the right time.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
He is not like that. He is lucky.

51:50.000 --> 51:56.000
A completely different situation arises when we start to evaluate our failures, our failures.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
If we are talking about our loved ones,

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
no matter how objective and experienced we are,

52:06.000 --> 52:13.000
we believe that the reason for our failures is due to external circumstances.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
We didn't bring the goods on time,

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
the boss didn't pay attention to me,

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
the phone didn't ring,

52:24.000 --> 52:30.000
and, accordingly, the reasons for my failures are due to external circumstances.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
If I consider my achievements,

52:35.000 --> 52:41.000
the undisputed reason for my achievements is that I am so good.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
I made an effort.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
I put in the effort to achieve the result.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
And no matter what circumstances prevented me,

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
despite them, thanks to my personality, qualities, willpower, I achieved the result.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
This is a fundamental mistake of attribution.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
And even knowing about it, people...

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
Today, a lot is written about causal attribution.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
It is studied in many MBA courses,

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
it is studied in many trainings,

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
but still, in fact, it is really a distinctive feature of a person.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
If I see the success of another person,

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
I attribute the success of another person to the circumstances that led to it.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
If I see the failure of another person,

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
I say that no matter what circumstances led to it,

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
he would still have achieved nothing.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
I attribute the personal reason for his failure.

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
When it is about me, I act in a completely different way.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
My achievements are my personal qualities, I am so good,

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
and my failures are external circumstances.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
This is a fundamental mistake of attribution.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
It is a simple thing.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
And, of course, Kelly was not the first person to pay attention to it.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
This approach has been known for a long time,

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
we can read it in a huge number of books,

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
both in artistic literature and in historical literature.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
But as for Kelly, he experimentally justified and proved it.

54:19.000 --> 54:24.000
After Kelly, there was already such a large experimental base

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
that really recorded that a person in his social perception is so.

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
This is how a person's impression is formed.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
All my successes are my achievements, all his successes are circumstances.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
And vice versa, all my failures are circumstances,

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
all his successes are circumstances that he was lucky.

54:49.000 --> 54:56.000
This mistake is manifested in business, in power, in politics.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
It is made again and again.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
They know it, but they still make it.

55:01.000 --> 55:08.000
Perhaps this is the human weakness that we have.

55:09.000 --> 55:16.000
But the fact is that when we interact,

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
when we form a social communication,

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
and try to analyze it,

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
try to analyze the causes of our achievements, our failures,

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
we need to keep in mind this approach of causal attribution,

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
because it often seems useful and interesting to us.

55:38.000 --> 55:46.000
This is what concerns those ideas that can be highlighted in social perception

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
in terms of the formation of an impression.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
But at the same time, we need to pay attention to one more fact.

55:52.000 --> 55:59.000
When people interact, we often use verbal communication.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
We talk about something, we discuss something.

56:02.000 --> 56:07.000
We use speech, we use those or other sound forms of communication,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
which exist.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
However, in addition to verbal communication,

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
there are a huge number of non-verbal approaches,

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
non-verbal ways of conveying those or other sensations

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
that are analyzed, that are perceived by another person.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
The mimics that are written on our faces are related to non-verbal communication.

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
What concerns this mimicry,

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
it can often coincide with what we say.

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
We smile because we are really glad that we met someone.

56:46.000 --> 56:53.000
But it often turns out that the mimics go against our words.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
We say that we are glad to see someone,

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
but we bend our lips, turn away, look away.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
And at the same time, the person we interact with notices all this.

57:08.000 --> 57:17.000
And he sees how our verbal phrases go against what we really experience and experience.

57:17.000 --> 57:25.000
Moreover, if we control these things in terms of verbal phrases,

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
then our facial expressions, our emotional reactions are usually not controlled by a person.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Just because he doesn't pay attention to it.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
In addition to facial expressions, we also have gestures, poses, movements.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
In the end, as far as our speech is concerned,

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
we also have various intonations, various exclamations,

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
various whispers, various intermediates, various pronouns,

57:51.000 --> 57:58.000
which, again, tell our real attitude towards a person,

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
our real attitude to the actions he takes,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
our real attitude to what we say.

58:06.000 --> 58:14.000
This is the situation when we talk one thing, think another, and strive to do the third.

58:14.000 --> 58:20.000
As for non-verbal communication, this is a separate and very interesting topic.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
Naturally, in order to master your non-verbal skills,

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
you need to at least study your usual ways of expression,

58:29.000 --> 58:36.000
facial muscles, see yourself in the mirror, as it is called.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
There are special non-verbal communication trainings,

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
but we will not talk about it in more detail today.

58:45.000 --> 58:54.000
We will focus our attention on the ways of analyzing verbal information,

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
because verbal information, from the point of view of social interaction,

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
is the most significant and the most interesting.

59:02.000 --> 59:08.000
When we talk about the impressions that people have during communication,

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
it is often based on the words that we say,

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
in the sense that we insert.

59:16.000 --> 59:28.000
And, accordingly, we will focus our attention on the analysis of what verbal communication is,

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
and what verbal methods of controlling impressions are.

59:32.000 --> 59:38.000
So, when people talk about something,

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
they use the usual communication methods in words.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Someone speaks quickly, someone speaks slowly,

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
someone speaks aggressively, someone strives to find a compromise in interaction.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
As the research conducted by cognitive psychologists shows,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000
there are certain ways of verbal communication of people.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Thanks to the work of Bateson, Grinder, Diels,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000
the most significant elements that characterize our verbal communication methods were highlighted.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Now we will consider different approaches to verbal communication,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
and at the same time we will analyze how these approaches can be useful

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
in the process of communication, in the process of interaction.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And in the situation when we need to form a certain impression about another person,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and when we need to control the impression,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:52.000
so that we get the desired impression of another person.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
As for the metaprograms,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
metaprograms are a set of verbal tools

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:14.000
inherent to each person in terms of focusing attention on certain ways of expressing their thoughts.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Usually, we do not pay special attention to the formation of certain metaprograms.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
They are formed depending on our upbringing,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
they are formed depending on our education,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
depending on the communication with those people who surround us, who teach us, who are significant to us.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:45.000
We usually look at the person who has achieved the results that we also want to achieve

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and try to model his behavior.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And in general, unconsciously, unconsciously,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:59.000
we also model his behavior, his way of speaking, his way of presenting verbal information.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000
As for Grindr, Bates, and Nandil,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
they conducted an analysis of the verbal communication of a huge number of people.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
These are successful people, unsuccessful people, ordinary people, outstanding people.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And they were able to identify common approaches and common ways that they use

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
in order to form a certain impression

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and achieve the impression that was formed by other people.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000
As for these elements,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
they highlighted basically 7 elements.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Again, it should be said that, of course, after these works were published,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:00.000
after other researchers did analysis, repetition, optimization of the same studies,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
they proposed other elements of metaprograms,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
other ways of focusing attention on one or another information,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
on certain nuances, on ways of presenting and interpreting information.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
But, in principle, I think these questions, these nuances are not so important to us.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Let's focus on the original schemes that were developed.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
So, when we talk about metaprograms,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:38.000
the first thing to pay attention to is the ways of classifying information about the world.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
If a person says something, if a person interacts with someone,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
has verbal contact, then he is engaged in transmitting information.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It can be completely different information that concerns different aspects of life,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
different aspects of reality.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
At the same time, people usually pay attention,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
in their story they focus attention on quite specific approaches.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So, on what elements can this information be classified?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Well, there are people who prefer to pay attention to the staff first of all.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
They don't say that something has been done, the results have been achieved.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
They say specifically, this person did this, another person did that.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Each action they highlight, each event, each circumstance they talk about,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:48.000
they always say who did it, who should be focused on,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
who is the authority in a particular area.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
This is the classification of the world by staff or people.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And, accordingly, if we interact with such people,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and we see that it is important for them to demonstrate the knowledge of those or other people

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
who dealt with these issues, then we should build our communication in the same way.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
We should also show our attention to staff, to people,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
if we want to get in touch and communicate with representatives of this type of metaprograms.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Other people pay more attention to the values.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Why do we do something?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Why do we go to work?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Why do we pay taxes?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Why do we study?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Why do we sign contracts?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Why do we make agreements?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
For these people, it is not important who signs the contract,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
who signs the contract, what it is about.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
For these people, it is not important where it is done, when it is done.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
For these people, the values are important.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
The values, from the point of view of the answer to the question, why?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
If I do something, then I must have a goal.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And all my actions must be aimed at the realization of this or that goal.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
For these people, the values are important.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
If we want to get in touch with such a person and get an understanding with him,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000
because the metaprogram is a way of understanding in our verbal interaction with another person,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
if we understand the accents that he highlights,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
and he focuses his attention on, then we can find mutual understanding with him.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
If a person we are talking to is always thinking about values,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
why am I doing certain actions,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and for us it is important who is doing these actions,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
we will not get into mutual understanding.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
This is what is called, he is talking about one thing, and I am talking about another.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I ask him about the goal of our meeting,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and he tells me that this person advised me to meet him.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
We do not have mutual understanding.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
We speak the same language, but in fact we speak different languages.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
We focus our attention on different aspects.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And if we focus our attention on different aspects, then, accordingly,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
we will no longer have mutual understanding.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
We speak different languages.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Another category of people can attract attention

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
either through processes or procedures.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That is, in fact, a question of how we do something.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Again, for someone the process is important,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
the procedure itself is important.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And he will list what needs to be done,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
what dangers to avoid,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
what results to achieve,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
what to get, how to get,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
how to do it.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
These are the doers.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
For these people the procedure itself is not important.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
For these people the result is not important.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Here we are talking about what?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It is the process of doing.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Accordingly, when we interact with such a person,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
we should not strive to pay attention to the final result that we want to get.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The execution of the plan, the achievement of such and such indicators.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
These people need to be told about the process.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
How will the logistics of the cargo be carried out?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
How will its distribution be carried out?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Where will it be implemented?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
What processes, what forms,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
what are the possibilities, what are the dangers?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
These are, in fact, the doers.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Here we are talking about the procedure.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
We are the doers.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Naturally, if we are talking about mutual understanding,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
we must understand the person's desire.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Because these are questions that are important to him.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And, accordingly, we must also go to this procedural level.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Naturally, this is the art of negotiations.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Of course, it is difficult for us to move away from our schemes.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
But the difference between a good negotiator and an ordinary one

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
is that he can always adapt to the classification,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
to the nuances that he has from the person he is communicating with.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Other people may pay attention not to the processes,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
but to the actions, to the things.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
What will be the result?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
If the process of doing concerns the process-makers,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
and the longer and better you will schedule this process,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
the longer and better you will talk, the more calm it will be,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
the more those who are focused on the actions and the things are interested in the result.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
What exactly will I get as a result of this process?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And here, very often, there is a contradiction.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
If there is a process-maker and a classifier in action,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
they will not understand each other.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
For a person will ask,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I am now signing a contract, I am paying this money,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
then I transfer it, what and when I will get in the end,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
and he will start to answer in the verbal order,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
that we will deliver this, we will convert this, and so on.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
People again speak different languages,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
these are their languages, but they do not have an understanding between them.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Again, another way of classifying the world is by time.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
There are people, and they are not so rare,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
for whom the time aspects are important.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000
If we do something, how much time will it take us to do this operation?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
What time should the contracts be signed?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
When should the goods be delivered?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
In fact, these are people who are focused on the time frame,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
and for whom such a parameter as time is important.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
These are people who value their time,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
these are people who know how to work and know how to operate with time.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And if this person asks you questions

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
about the time of implementation of certain actions,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
the time of implementation of certain processes,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
then it makes no sense to speak to him in a procedural language.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
He does not need to know what you will do,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
he is interested in how long it will be done.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
He does not care about the result,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
what you do is very important,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
he cares about the time when this result will be achieved.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Again, it does not matter whether it is about values or people who will do it.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Time. What?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
We have signed a contract.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
On the 23rd, all our agreements must be fulfilled.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
How will it be done?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Who will do it?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Why will it be done?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
These are the second, third, fourth, fifth questions.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I am interested in time.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
If I want to make an adequate negotiation,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I must switch to this language.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The next element in the classification of the world is the place.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Where will everything be implemented?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Where will the products be delivered?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Where will the contract be signed?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Where will the deal be made?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Neither time nor values are important,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
nor the process, nor the result, nor the procedure.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
The place is important.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Again, I want to draw your attention to the fact that,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
as usual, when we list the schemes,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
it does not mean that all people are divided into six categories.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Of course, we are all normal people,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and we are all interested in all of these points.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But!

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Of all these points,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
we may be more or less interested in some of them.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
It does not mean that there are people who only classify the world

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
by people, by values, by processes, by actions, by time, by place.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
There are people who can classify time by processes

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and the time of the implementation of the process.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
There are people who can classify the world by people and the implementation of the process,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
by values and the place of the implementation of the process.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
When we interact with someone,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
we need to listen to him carefully and understand these important elements for a person.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
The scheme of the meaningful model that we are talking about now

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
essentially sets out the criteria

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
that we need to be able to pay attention to

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and which will allow us to take one of the steps

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
to build mutual understanding.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
If we are negotiating, we need to understand the other person.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
If we want a person to have a certain impression,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
then, accordingly, we will be interested in speaking to this person in the same language.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So, this is the first metaprogram

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
that was considered, that was built.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And you can judge that

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
what concerns this metaprogram,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
again, there is nothing new in it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
These are all obvious things.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
But, unfortunately, or fortunately,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
all those successful elements that appear in different people,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.000
they are that they are able to focus their attention

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
on what is important, on what is relevant for another person

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and to meet him in interaction.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
The next element of the metaprogram

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
is the style of information organization.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
What is meant in this case?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
The fact is that the first element of this style

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
is the size of the generalization that we do.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Different people are used to doing different kinds of generalization.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Someone likes to speak, someone has a fairly large generalization.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
We have a large scale.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
If we speak about the Motherland as a whole, about the planet as a whole,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
about the Universe as a whole, about business as a whole,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
we will not go into such details

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
that concern the city, the district, the person.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
In this case, we are talking about a global approach.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Globalists are strategists.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Another style of information development is the small size.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I do not argue that patriotism is good.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I do not doubt that we should think about the Motherland.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
But still, I am sorry, here is my company,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
here is my money, here are my results.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And I am not interested in what will happen in our country.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I am interested in what my company,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
specifically, in a week, specifically,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
in Moscow will receive from our contract.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
When two people meet with different information distribution,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
very often they speak about their own,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
but they do not understand each other.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
They speak the same language, they speak about the same contract,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
they speak about the same interaction.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
But one person speaks about the prospects of the business as a whole,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and the other person speaks specifically about his own tasks and problems.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The fact is that, again, each of us is used to think in different categories.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
This is a habit that has entered our blood.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
This is what we do not realize.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And when we try to understand,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
but we do not see this understanding,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
we can again misjudge the impression that is created in us by another person.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Maybe he is mocking us,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
maybe he manipulates us, maybe he wants to deceive us.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
The problem is that we have different ways of communication,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
which exist when we give the same information,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
which is equally interesting to both of us.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But, in addition to the size of communication,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
there are also different ways of thinking.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It has long been a common phrase that all people are different,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
that everyone has different intellectual approaches,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
different ways of thinking.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
But as for cognitive science,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
it has managed to highlight three ways of thinking

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
that can be used to develop people.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Again, these methods have long been known in logic,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:21.000
but no one has tried to apply these ways of thinking to practice,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000
to our specific business contacts, business analysis, business interaction.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
As for these ways of thinking,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
the first way of thinking is deduction,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
deductive way of thinking.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
In this case, we go from general to private.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
First, we analyze common ideas, common concepts,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
and then from these common ideas,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
depending on what tasks arise in front of us,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
we are already trying to draw private conclusions.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.000
This deductive way of thinking is very widespread and is used in mathematics.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Another way of thinking is induction.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
This is a way of thinking when we go from private to general.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Despite the fact that Sherlock Holmes called his way of thinking deductive,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
in fact, it was induction from a logical point of view.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
He selected details, he selected elementary approaches,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and then, based on these small facts,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
he drew a general conclusion about the motive of a crime, about the place of a crime.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
From a logical point of view, this is an inductive approach.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Again, many of you may remember those people

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
who can be stopped by every little thing,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
who are very modest, who are very pedantic.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And if you want to get an understanding with them,

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
you must be ready that every detail

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
will be considered from different points of view,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
that it will be broken, that it will be messed up.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And this is simply because a person is so used to thinking,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
that a person is so used to approaching these issues.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
This is his way of analyzing information, this is his way of thinking.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It makes no sense to say whether he is bad or good.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
You can think deductively, you can think inductively,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
and get equally good results.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
To someone, as usual, to someone, as good.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And the third way of thinking that stands out

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
is the so-called analogy thinking, or the translation, as it is called in logic.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Such a person does not need to draw conclusions from the general to the private,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
from the private to the general.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Such a person needs to draw some kind of analogy,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
that if we conclude this contract,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000
we will get a situation similar to the one that happened at Ford factories in the 1930s

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
and contributed to the formation of the middle class in America.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You drew an analogy.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And this is understandable for a person.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
This is a person who thinks metaphorically,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
who thinks using analog schemes,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
who wants to either imagine something,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
either to hear something,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
or, in the end, to feel something.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Here, generalization or reasoning are not important.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
The analogy is important.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
A person does not understand something.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
And we must make up a metaphor,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
make up any analogy that will help him understand the process.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
If we get into this analogy that a person has made,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
we conclude the contract, we have a successful negotiation.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
If we cannot deny it, then we say everything is absolutely correct.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
We do not make mistakes.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
But a person does not understand us.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
He does not understand the wise words that are spoken here.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And it is not clear why he needs it.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
He needs examples.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:59.000
There are a lot of people who need to be given a good example from his life,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
from the life of people important to him,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
from the life of those he is guided by,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
in order to convince him that the impression that we are trying to achieve,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
the idea that we are trying to achieve,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
is really interesting to him.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
In addition to the way of thinking,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
when we talk about the style of organization of information,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000
the representative system that is important to a person is also very important.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
This is what we talked a lot about at the very beginning of our meeting today.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000
A person either sees something,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and this is a visual system for him,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
a person either hears something,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
and this is an audio system for him,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
or a person tries to do something with his own hands, to feel.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
This is a kinesthetic system.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
This is very important to know when we make representations.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
We have already talked about the visuals,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
which is about 60% of people,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
and the ideal is 20-20% of people,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
and the kinesthetic is 10-15%, but this is a statistic.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
If you come with a wonderful presentation

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000
to the owner of the company with whom you want to conclude a business contract,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and you start showing it,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
and the presentation is very good,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
you really put a lot of effort into it,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
it reflects all aspects of your contract,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
the person doesn't understand.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And he doesn't understand because he doesn't need to see what you show him on the slides,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
but to hear what you say.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
To tell the same thing,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
instead of saying, look at the slide,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
read it to this person,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
talk to him,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
no matter how strange it seems to you.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
It seems like, why would I read it, he doesn't know how to read himself.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
He knows how to read, but he is used to listening to information.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And when you say, here is a chart,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
he looks at it, he sees it,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
but this is not a significant way of presenting information to him.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
And if you say the same thing in words,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
then he will hear and understand what you want to say to him with this chart.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000
If you come and make a wonderful speech presentation,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000
where you show some kind of feedback

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
about your company,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
about your problems,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
about your approaches,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
and the person is visual,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
you can speak brilliantly for 2-3 hours,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
with good diction,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
with good intonation,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
he will hear everything, he will understand everything,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
but this is not him.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
He is sorry for those 3 hours he spent on you.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Give him a chart,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
where you drew a chart,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
where you showed the growth of the indicators he will achieve.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
This will be enough for him,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
and it didn't take 2-3 hours.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yes, of course.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
When you come to assist in negotiations,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
you may not know the partner you are working with,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
but here you need to know how to orient yourself.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
This is what this program is for,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
this is what the cognitive approach is for,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
in order not to give these recipes once and for all,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
but to make you, when you communicate with a person,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
look at his reaction and see if he hears you,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
sees you, feels you,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
and gets the results he needs.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
If you see that your drawings don't reach the person,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
voice them,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
and you will see for yourself

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
how much the perception of everything you say has changed.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
All these elements in the style of the organization of information

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
must be constantly taken into account,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
because brilliant presentations,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
brilliant efforts of the whole departments

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
collapse for one simple reason.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
You made a beautiful drawing,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
a three-dimensional graphic,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
but you didn't make the necessary audio accompaniment,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and the person didn't hear what you wanted to show him.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
As for the visuals,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
they very often use the words

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I see, I understand,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
and, accordingly, I am clear.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
And the audio speakers say,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I hear,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I listen,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I am deaf.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
So, those particular phrases

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
characterize the representative system that works.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
The most difficult thing is with the visual aesthetics,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
because these are people who feel,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
who can speak about a rough thought,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
who can speak about a flat idea,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and this is not a judgmental judgment.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
They translate their kinesthetic sensations,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
the sensation of hands,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
the sensation of taste,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
the smell that is familiar to them.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And since the kinesthetic sensations of a person...

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
We use the description of these sensations first.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
As for our psyche,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
it works visually and audibly,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
so it is the most difficult to work with the kinesthetic.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
But it is also interesting,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
because if you can communicate with him

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
in the language of his representative system,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
in the language of his perception organs,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
and he naturally understands perfectly

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
that as few people can do it,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
you immediately arrange a conversation.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And it doesn't matter what you came with.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It is important that you give him pleasure

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
to talk to him in the rare kinesthetic language.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And this is worth it.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So, this is what concerns the style of information organization.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
The next element of the metaprogram

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
that is worth talking about

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
is the focus of comparison.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
We provide information,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
and when we provide information,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
we always try to make different kinds of comparisons.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
How does our proposal differ from the proposal of a competitor?

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
How is our proposal better than the proposal

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
that another company makes?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
As for the focus of comparison,

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
there can be two things.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Either we focus on similarity,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
that is, we try to find common elements that exist,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
or we focus on differences.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
What is the difference of our proposal?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
This is a very important element,

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
because if you come to him with your business portfolio,

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
with a very interesting proposal,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and it is important for a person to find out

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
what he or she thinks about it,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
then you come to him with different proposals.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
But if this person likes to distinguish

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
what your proposal is different from what he or she has already heard,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and you, on the contrary, think that it is better to talk about similarity,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
that my proposal is slightly different from what you have in your company,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
you immediately talk to him in different languages.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
He needs a difference.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
He knows himself what is happening in his company,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
how it is happening.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But what is the difference between what you propose

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
and what he or she owns now?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
If you catch this focus of comparison,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
and if you, when providing information,

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
when forming impressions,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
or when changing impressions,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
which occur between people,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
focus on this attention,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
then, accordingly, you speak the same language.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And if you speak the same language,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
then, accordingly, you immediately enter into a mutual understanding.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
After all, what is our verbal interaction?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
It doesn't matter if we speak Russian, English, Chinese, Japanese.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Our verbal interaction is that we want to be heard.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000
We want to be spoken to not just in one language,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
but in our metaprograms.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
So that from all the information that is dropped on us,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
it is what I am used to distinguish.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I can distinguish exactly those points,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
exactly then and exactly there,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
how I am used to do it.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And, accordingly, when I see the same accents,

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I feel the soul of my relatives.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And since it is the soul of my relatives,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
it means that my attitude towards this person changes completely.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
This is what concerns the focus of comparison.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.000
The next element of the metaprogram is motivation.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
As for motivation,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
it is always the reason for a person's behavior.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
What do I want to do?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And why do I want to do it?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
When we talk about motivation,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
two aspects are usually highlighted.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
The first is the direction of motivation.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000
We list the advantages of a particular proposal

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
and say that if we sign this contract,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
we will get a particular result.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And here the direction is important.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
What is important for a person?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
The result we are approaching,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
or the negative result we are moving away from.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
What will I get from this proposal?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Further development of my business

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and the seizure of the market segment,

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:07.000
or I move away from my company,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
from my competitors.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Different people are oriented to different aspects of life.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Someone is looking forward to what is waiting for him.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And of course, we always strive to see the positive ahead.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Our motivation is directed forward,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
to what is waiting for me,

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
to the positive.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
A normal person will not strive for the negative,

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
he is not a suicide.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
The other person, on the contrary,

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
pays attention to all the negative things,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
which may be the main task for him.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Not striving for the possible positive.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I can seize more market shares,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I can lose the one I have.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
In this case, this person strives to avoid negative trends.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
He is not oriented forward, not to the positive,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
but to what I already have.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And this is what I should be driven by.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Moreover, I know a lot of unsuccessful examples.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I know how a company ceased to exist,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
how it merged with someone,

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
how this company was sold.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I know a lot of unpleasant cases,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
which I don't want.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And that's why it's important for me

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
not to avoid the next turtle,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
but to avoid the negative,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
which may be, which I have already avoided.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
And that's why you came to me with an agreement.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I want to know now

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
how much more I will get rid of the negative,

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
which I have managed to get rid of.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
This is the direction of motivation.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Again, when we talk to a person,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
we should listen to what interests him.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
What to go to or what to go from.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
No matter how funny it is,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
what does he use more often?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
What is the preposition?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I want to try to build my speech

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and my proposal in the dominant prepositions

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
for this person.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
This is the direction of motivation.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
But on the other hand,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
there is another aspect of motivation,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
which is activity.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
There are active people,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
they are interested in what I should do

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
for their fulfillment.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
What should others do?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
What should my activity be?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And there are other people,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
who are interested in my proposal.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Okay, I have already reached certain limits,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I have already reached a certain position on the market.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Will it shake my position?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Will it make me do something again?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
The difference between active and passive.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Someone is an activist, someone is a stabilizer.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Give the activist a direction.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Tell him what to do.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And accordingly, it will be his motivation

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
to do what no one has done before.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
And the stabilizer, on the contrary.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I already have this stability.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
How can I strengthen this stability even more?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
It doesn't matter.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And it's not about what is good or bad,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
to be active or passive.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
People are divided by their ways of motivation in information.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And if you want to get their understanding,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
you don't need to give an assessment to the person,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
how he does something.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
It's important for you to understand

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
whether he likes to do or stabilize.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And talk to him in his language.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
These are the aspects that are important to understand about motivation.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
But in order to understand this,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
you just need to listen to what the person says,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
