00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
In order to make an investment decision, we will need to familiarize ourselves with the four basic rules that are applied in this process

00:13.200 --> 00:19.600
The first rule is related to the pure given value, abbreviated as NPV

00:19.600 --> 00:24.800
Next, the Internal Revenue Rate, IRR

00:24.800 --> 00:28.600
Next, the profitability index and the period of purchase

00:29.200 --> 00:37.000
The last two parameters are familiar to us from the standard procedures of the economic analysis of the enterprise

00:37.000 --> 00:42.600
But they are used with an amendment to the discount

00:42.600 --> 00:52.800
The first two, NPV and IRR, are entirely and completely built on the model of assessing the value of a financial asset

00:53.400 --> 00:58.800
We will also consider a couple of points in this section, but more on that later

00:58.800 --> 01:17.200
So, the pure given value, abbreviated as NPV, is the difference between the discounted investments in the project and the discounted cash flows from the project

01:17.600 --> 01:32.400
Remember, when we work in the standard economy, when we operate with accounting, we take the expenses per nominal and the income per nominal, and find the difference

01:32.400 --> 01:40.800
In our case, we use the expenses and income in the same way, but only after the discount

01:41.400 --> 01:50.200
So, if you discount, returning to the example of determining your value

01:50.200 --> 02:03.200
If you discount all your expenses that you will have to make in the next year, and all your income that you will have to get in the next year

02:03.600 --> 02:16.200
You will get two numbers, then subtract the expenses from the income, you will get a difference, either positive or negative

02:16.200 --> 02:26.200
And this will be evidence that you have income for this year, or vice versa, you do not have it and you will be in debt to someone

02:27.200 --> 02:32.200
Let's go back to our slide. The rules of using NPV

02:32.200 --> 02:40.600
You can accept a project for execution, for financing, if the NPV is greater than zero

02:40.600 --> 02:47.200
You can, if you have several projects, accept a project for execution, whose NPV is the largest

02:47.200 --> 02:49.200
These are simple rules

02:49.200 --> 02:55.200
But I would like to ask you a question. What if the NPV project is zero?

02:55.200 --> 02:59.200
Should you accept such a project for execution, if there are no others?

02:59.200 --> 03:04.200
There are situations when such a project can be accepted for execution. Why?

03:04.200 --> 03:10.200
Because thanks to such a project, you can save your capital

03:11.200 --> 03:18.200
Your capital will not decrease, but it will not grow. It will remain at the same level, and this is already an achievement

03:18.200 --> 03:22.200
You were able to save it over the past year, not lose it

03:22.200 --> 03:27.200
So in some cases, a project with a zero NPV can be accepted

03:27.200 --> 03:37.200
At the same time, I will draw your attention to the fact that a project with a zero NPV will certainly have an accounting profit

03:37.200 --> 03:44.200
Let's look at a more detailed example. The following slide shows the calculations

03:44.200 --> 03:50.200
So, the investment in the project is 100 units

03:50.200 --> 03:56.200
Let's assume that these investments are made at once, at the current time

03:56.200 --> 04:02.200
They do not need to be discounted. At the current time. We do this to make the example easier

04:02.200 --> 04:14.200
The project is designed for 5 years, and its cash flows are 20, 20, 20, 30 and 30 units

04:14.200 --> 04:23.200
If we add them up by the nominal, we get a profit of 120 minus 100, the income is certainly higher than the expenses

04:23.200 --> 04:30.200
The discount rate is 10%, in other words, the market value of the resources is 10%

04:31.200 --> 04:43.200
Then we substitute everything in the formula. NPV, we take the investment in the project with a minus sign, because it is the cash flow

04:43.200 --> 04:49.200
Everything else we take with a plus sign, because it is the inflow of cash

04:49.200 --> 04:57.200
Please note that the discount rate is not in percents, but in dollars

04:57.200 --> 05:06.200
So, if we calculate by this formula, for example, a computer or Excel can do it very quickly

05:06.200 --> 05:12.200
Then we get that NPV is equal to, look, the second line

05:12.200 --> 05:19.200
20 units of income received a year later today cost us 18 kopecks

05:19.200 --> 05:26.200
20 units of income received two years later today cost us 16 kopecks

05:26.200 --> 05:38.200
Then 15 and income of 30 units per year we turn into today's 20 and 18

05:38.200 --> 05:45.200
If we add them all up, we get only 88, almost 89 units

05:45.200 --> 05:53.200
This is not enough to get to zero NPV, we get a negative NPV

05:53.200 --> 06:04.200
In fact, if we take up the implementation of this project, and even if we successfully implement it, we will incur a financial loss of 11 units

06:04.200 --> 06:06.200
This is an absolute value

06:06.200 --> 06:18.200
In the absence of other information, we can say that this project should be rejected

06:19.200 --> 06:24.200
The next rule is related to the so-called period of payback

06:24.200 --> 06:33.200
This is a period that is required to reimburse investment, but taking into account the discounting procedure

06:33.200 --> 06:37.200
Let's look at an example, it is shown on the slide

06:37.200 --> 06:45.200
The same initial 100 units of investment, the same 5 years for which the project is designed

06:46.200 --> 06:56.200
If we take the already discounted cash flows, let them be equal to 25, 25, 25, 25 and 30

06:56.200 --> 07:00.200
4 times 25, the last year 30 units

07:00.200 --> 07:05.200
And check the NPV, yes, there are 30 units

07:05.200 --> 07:14.200
Now about the period of payback, our initial 100 units will pay off exactly in the first 4 years

07:14.200 --> 07:17.200
There is no formula, everything is quite obvious

07:17.200 --> 07:23.200
You add up the cash flows until the amount does not exceed the initial investment

07:23.200 --> 07:34.200
If our investment amount was not 100 units, but 110, what would be the period of payback?

07:35.200 --> 07:37.200
Now the answer

07:37.200 --> 07:45.200
In order to get the required amount of 110 units, we will have to wait 4 years

07:45.200 --> 07:50.200
25, 25, 25, 25, 100, and we need 110

07:50.200 --> 07:58.200
4 years with the last 5 years will bring us 30 units of income

07:59.200 --> 08:05.200
We need to get 10 more units of income to pay back the investment

08:05.200 --> 08:08.200
Therefore, it is 1 third of the amount

08:08.200 --> 08:18.200
Thus, we can say that the period of payback in this case will be 4.1 years

08:18.200 --> 08:24.200
The next rule is the use of the profitability index

08:24.200 --> 08:30.200
The profitability index is almost the same as the NPV, but expressed in percents

08:30.200 --> 08:42.200
If we found a difference between the investment in the project and the income from the project

08:43.200 --> 08:53.200
In this case, we need to find the relationship between the two amounts

08:53.200 --> 08:56.200
You can see an example here

08:56.200 --> 09:07.200
If the income from the project is 130 units, our investment in the project is 100 units

09:07.200 --> 09:11.200
The profitability index gives us 130%

09:12.200 --> 09:16.200
The rule of application is very simple

09:16.200 --> 09:21.200
If the index is greater than 1, we accept the project, if it is less, we reject it

09:21.200 --> 09:26.200
If it is greater than 1, it means that the NPV is greater than 0

09:26.200 --> 09:29.200
If it is less than 1, it means that the NPV is less than 0

09:29.200 --> 09:36.200
There are situations when you compare different projects, but with different amounts

09:37.200 --> 09:42.200
The profitability index allows you to move away from absolute numbers and move to relative numbers

09:42.200 --> 09:48.200
Now about the internal profitability rate

09:48.200 --> 09:50.200
This is the next slide

09:50.200 --> 09:56.200
It is quite interesting and the moment when many people start to get confused

09:56.200 --> 09:59.200
Although there is nothing complicated there

10:00.200 --> 10:05.200
The internal profitability rate is a percentage rate

10:05.200 --> 10:08.200
In which the NPV of the project is 0

10:08.200 --> 10:13.200
Of course, it should be a project with a positive NPV

10:13.200 --> 10:19.200
Then the internal profitability rate will be positive

10:19.200 --> 10:24.200
The internal profitability rate cannot be negative

10:24.200 --> 10:30.200
Any percentage rate cannot be negative

10:30.200 --> 10:34.200
Look at the slide

10:34.200 --> 10:37.200
At the formula that is written there

10:37.200 --> 10:41.200
You see that the example with an investment project

10:41.200 --> 10:44.200
Where we have 100 units of investments

10:44.200 --> 10:48.200
And for the first 4 years and the last 30 years

10:48.200 --> 10:50.200
Our cash flows

10:50.200 --> 10:53.200
What about the indicators?

10:53.200 --> 10:56.200
The indicators have the same value

10:56.200 --> 10:57.200
IRR

10:57.200 --> 11:05.200
Unfortunately, there is no mathematical formula to calculate IRR

11:05.200 --> 11:12.200
The easiest way is to find this rate in the computer

11:12.200 --> 11:18.200
For example, IRR is 9.0%

11:18.200 --> 11:23.200
This means that at the cost of resources on the market

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
At the cost of money

11:25.200 --> 11:28.200
9.0%

11:28.200 --> 11:30.200
9.18%

11:30.200 --> 11:33.200
Your project will have a zero NPV

11:33.200 --> 11:40.200
But if you have a rate that you can discount

11:40.200 --> 11:42.200
A rate at which you attract money

11:42.200 --> 11:46.200
Or a rate at which you must work

11:46.200 --> 11:51.200
Less than 6%

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
7%

11:52.200 --> 11:56.200
Then you will definitely have a positive NPV

11:56.200 --> 12:00.200
So, if IRR

12:00.200 --> 12:02.200
Internal profitability rate

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
This is the rule

12:03.200 --> 12:06.200
If IRR is more profitable

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
More market profitability

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
Or required profitability

12:08.200 --> 12:11.200
The project can be accepted

12:12.200 --> 12:23.200
We can also say that IRR is a kind of indicator of the project's strength, reliability, and stability

12:23.200 --> 12:26.200
It is a kind of a reserve of the project's strength

12:26.200 --> 12:30.200
The greater the difference between IRR and market profitability

12:30.200 --> 12:35.200
The more stable your project will be in the future

12:35.200 --> 12:37.200
The more reliable your project will be in the future

12:38.200 --> 12:41.200
We make investment decisions

12:41.200 --> 12:45.200
We are forced to predict the future, which is not determined

12:45.200 --> 12:53.200
Therefore, the more stable the project is in relation to the risk of changing the interest rate in the future

12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
The better

12:55.200 --> 12:59.200
Therefore, when making a decision, you must focus

12:59.200 --> 13:02.200
When making a decision, when choosing investment projects

13:02.200 --> 13:06.200
You must focus on the NPV, its absolute value

13:06.200 --> 13:08.200
The period of profitability

13:08.200 --> 13:09.200
The profitability index

13:09.200 --> 13:11.200
And IRR

13:11.200 --> 13:13.200
All these parameters together

13:13.200 --> 13:15.200
Will give you information

13:15.200 --> 13:18.200
About how profitable this project is

13:18.200 --> 13:20.200
How much it will increase capital

13:20.200 --> 13:23.200
How quickly it will pay off

13:23.200 --> 13:26.200
And how stable it will be in the future

13:27.200 --> 13:32.200
Each of these parameters should not be used separately

13:32.200 --> 13:33.200
Only together

13:33.200 --> 13:36.200
Another question arises

13:36.200 --> 13:40.200
Since IRR and NPV intersect in something

13:40.200 --> 13:43.200
Which of these two parameters is better?

13:43.200 --> 13:49.200
Can't we use one parameter to assess the investment project?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.200
Why use a lot?

13:51.200 --> 13:54.200
There are such situations, there are such questions

13:54.200 --> 13:56.200
What is better?

13:56.200 --> 14:00.200
The absolute value of NPV or the relative value of IRR?

14:02.200 --> 14:06.200
The question is controversial, there is no definite answer

14:06.200 --> 14:08.200
But here we need to clarify

14:08.200 --> 14:12.200
That IRR, unlike NPV, is a capricious lady

14:12.200 --> 14:14.200
And has its nuances

14:14.200 --> 14:17.200
Before we talk about these nuances

14:17.200 --> 14:21.200
It should be clarified that there are different types of money flows

14:21.200 --> 14:25.200
And depending on the type, there can be nuances related to IRR

14:25.200 --> 14:29.200
There are three main types of money flows

14:29.200 --> 14:32.200
Traditional money flow

14:32.200 --> 14:35.200
This is, look at the next slide

14:35.200 --> 14:38.200
Traditional money flow, borrowed money flow

14:38.200 --> 14:44.200
And several types of non-traditional money flows

14:44.200 --> 14:46.200
Let's start with the traditional

14:46.200 --> 14:48.200
Traditional money flow

14:48.200 --> 14:51.200
It means that you spent money at first

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
That is, you have a flow at first

14:53.200 --> 14:56.200
And then every period you have a flow of money

14:56.200 --> 15:01.200
Borrowed type of money flows

15:01.200 --> 15:04.200
It assumes that you have attracted resources from somewhere

15:04.200 --> 15:09.200
And then you spend them gradually every period

15:09.200 --> 15:14.200
Finally, non-traditional is a combination of the first two

15:14.200 --> 15:17.200
But in a situation where over time

15:17.200 --> 15:20.200
Your money flows change signs

15:20.200 --> 15:25.200
That is, today you invested money, it is a flow

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
Then you had inflows for three years in a row

15:28.200 --> 15:33.200
And then, for example, in 2004 you had some problems

15:33.200 --> 15:35.200
You have a flow of money resources

15:35.200 --> 15:37.200
And then again an inflow

15:37.200 --> 15:39.200
It will be a non-traditional money flow

15:39.200 --> 15:45.200
And it leads to the fact that you have not one IRR, but two

15:45.200 --> 15:47.200
Oddly enough

15:47.200 --> 15:50.200
So, what do money flows look like?

15:50.200 --> 15:55.200
The next slide shows us what a traditional money flow looks like

15:55.200 --> 16:00.200
Pay attention, with the growth of profitability, the NPV is reduced

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
This is quite natural

16:02.200 --> 16:05.200
With the growth of profitability, the NPV is reduced

16:05.200 --> 16:16.200
And IRR, you see, is the point where the line of our project intersects with the horizontal axis

16:16.200 --> 16:20.200
The money flow of the borrowed type is the reverse line

16:20.200 --> 16:23.200
By the way, the lines may not necessarily be curved

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
The project line can be straight

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
So it's just a drawing

16:27.200 --> 16:33.200
NPV, in this picture you see, grows with the growth of profitability

16:33.200 --> 16:36.200
This is a money flow of the borrowed type

16:36.200 --> 16:39.200
Finally, a non-traditional money flow

16:39.200 --> 16:41.200
One of its varieties

16:41.200 --> 16:44.200
In this case, it is a borrowed money flow

16:44.200 --> 16:49.200
You see that with the growth of profitability, the NPV grows

16:49.200 --> 16:53.200
Then comes the moment, the point of X-interruption

16:53.200 --> 17:01.200
After which, with the growth of profitability, the NPV begins to fall

17:02.200 --> 17:06.200
In this case, we will have two IRR in the project

17:09.200 --> 17:18.200
In principle, the maximum number of IRR is the number of times that the money flows change the sign from positive to negative or vice versa

17:18.200 --> 17:26.200
It is obvious that with the multiplicity of IRR in the project, its use is not purposeful

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
There is nothing to talk about

17:28.200 --> 17:32.200
But if for some reason you want to have this parameter

17:32.200 --> 17:38.200
You can do the calculation and get rid of negative money flows

17:38.200 --> 17:45.200
And thus bring your project to the traditional or borrowed type

17:45.200 --> 17:47.200
How can this be done?

17:47.200 --> 17:52.200
Let's look at the next two slides

17:52.200 --> 17:56.200
So, this will be an example of a calculation

17:56.200 --> 18:04.200
We have a project in which we spend 100 units in the first year

18:04.200 --> 18:09.200
Then in the second year we get 60 units of income

18:09.200 --> 18:12.200
Then we get 70 units of income

18:12.200 --> 18:19.200
And in the last year, for some reason, we have a flow of money in the amount of 10 units

18:19.200 --> 18:21.200
In other words, some additional investment

18:21.200 --> 18:25.200
What does this mean?

18:25.200 --> 18:27.200
This means that we will have two IRR

18:27.200 --> 18:29.200
But not very good

18:29.200 --> 18:32.200
How can we get rid of this?

18:32.200 --> 18:38.200
To do this, you need to get rid of minus 10 units

18:38.200 --> 18:42.200
From the sum where we have minus 10 units

18:42.200 --> 18:52.200
To do this, you need to bring minus 10 units of the money flow of the fourth year

18:52.200 --> 18:58.200
To the form comparable to the money flows of the third year

18:58.200 --> 19:02.200
And in the next slide you will see how we do it

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
Pay attention

19:04.200 --> 19:08.200
Minus 10 units is money from the fourth year

19:09.200 --> 19:15.200
You can get rid of them if you compare them to the third year

19:15.200 --> 19:17.200
The next year, the fourth

19:17.200 --> 19:19.200
So, what are we doing for this?

19:19.200 --> 19:23.200
We must discount minus 10 units for one year

19:23.200 --> 19:28.200
We discounted minus 10 units, we got, for example, minus 8 units

19:28.200 --> 19:31.200
This is not a principal value, but for example, minus 8

19:31.200 --> 19:39.200
Then our formula for determining NPV will look like this

19:39.200 --> 19:44.200
Two last sums, 70 remains unchanged

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
1 plus R to the third degree

19:46.200 --> 19:49.200
But the fourth sum has already changed its appearance

19:49.200 --> 19:53.200
This is minus 8, 1 plus R to the third degree

19:53.200 --> 19:56.200
The third and fourth sums are comparable

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200
They can be reduced

19:58.200 --> 20:04.200
As a result of the reduction, 70 minus 8 remains 62

20:04.200 --> 20:07.200
Thus, pay attention

20:07.200 --> 20:13.200
We got a formula, we got a new money flow, so to speak

20:13.200 --> 20:19.200
In which there are minus 100 units of spending at the moment

20:19.200 --> 20:21.200
During the current year

20:21.200 --> 20:26.200
And two positive money flows for the next two years

20:26.200 --> 20:37.200
This is the equivalent of the money flow that we considered at the beginning

20:37.200 --> 20:42.200
Namely, 60 after 2 years, 70 after 3, minus 10 after 4

20:42.200 --> 20:51.200
Thus, we got rid of the minus and brought our calculation to the traditional money flow

20:51.200 --> 20:54.200
Now we will have one NPR, it can be used

20:54.200 --> 20:56.200
One more nuance

20:56.200 --> 21:02.200
To discuss it, we will return to the CIPM and VACC model

21:02.200 --> 21:06.200
It would seem, if we know the profitability of our project

21:06.200 --> 21:08.200
10%

21:08.200 --> 21:11.200
Then you can calculate VACC

21:11.200 --> 21:15.200
And depending on the capital expenditure

21:15.200 --> 21:20.200
Say if this income is suitable for us or not

21:20.200 --> 21:27.200
For example, our capital expenditures are 12%

21:27.200 --> 21:30.200
12% is our capital expenditure

21:30.200 --> 21:33.200
Our project's profitability is 10%

21:33.200 --> 21:37.200
In theory, it seems that we should refuse it

21:37.200 --> 21:39.200
But this is not the right approach

21:39.200 --> 21:41.200
We can't say it without an operation

21:41.200 --> 21:48.200
First of all, because VACC does not take into account the risk factor

21:48.200 --> 21:51.200
There are no elements of discounting

21:51.200 --> 21:54.200
Pay attention to the next slide

21:54.200 --> 22:00.200
It shows two lines

22:00.200 --> 22:05.200
The first horizontal line shows us the VACC rate

22:05.200 --> 22:10.200
It does not change depending on the project's risk

22:10.200 --> 22:16.200
In this case, the risk of the financial asset is expressed in the beta coefficient

22:16.200 --> 22:21.200
No matter how the risk changes, VACC remains unchanged

22:21.200 --> 22:27.200
At the same time, the calculation of the CIPM model

22:27.200 --> 22:32.200
This is the second horizontal line, it is called SML

22:32.200 --> 22:42.200
The CIPM model shows us how the risk and profitability of the financial asset are related

22:42.200 --> 22:48.200
Now, pay attention to the gray field on the right

22:48.200 --> 22:50.200
It says, a non-profitable project

22:50.200 --> 22:55.200
If there is a dot with the word non-profitable project

22:55.200 --> 22:59.200
If there is the profitability and risk of our project

22:59.200 --> 23:02.200
Then it turns out to be an interesting picture

23:02.200 --> 23:06.200
The profitability of our project is higher than the VACC value

23:06.200 --> 23:09.200
It would seem that we should accept it

23:09.200 --> 23:13.200
But no, such a project should not be accepted

23:13.200 --> 23:15.200
Only because it is higher than VACC

23:15.200 --> 23:19.200
The fact is that it is less than the CIPM

23:19.200 --> 23:23.200
Which takes into account the ratio of risk and profit

23:23.200 --> 23:30.200
In other words, with this value of risk, which is marked with a dot

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
Under the name of a non-profitable project

23:32.200 --> 23:36.200
With this value of risk, the profitability should be much higher

23:36.200 --> 23:43.200
Having passed this project, we take on a high risk of non-profitability

23:43.200 --> 23:50.200
The other field is on the left, also a gray field

23:50.200 --> 23:53.200
It is marked with the inscription, a profitable project

23:53.200 --> 23:57.200
If we take a project located in this area

23:57.200 --> 24:01.200
It certainly gives less profitability than VACC

24:01.200 --> 24:03.200
It would seem that we should refuse it

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
But this is not true

24:05.200 --> 24:11.200
The fact is that this project, with the level of risk it has

24:11.200 --> 24:17.200
Has much more profitability than it should be, according to the logic of things

24:17.200 --> 24:22.200
This is a profitable project, and such a project should be accepted

24:22.200 --> 24:28.200
We have disassembled the basic rules of assessing investment projects

24:29.200 --> 24:33.200
I remind you that the assessment of investment projects is mainly a decision

24:33.200 --> 24:36.200
To accept the project for investment or not to accept it

24:36.200 --> 24:38.200
There are four main parameters

24:38.200 --> 24:41.200
This is NPV, the net value

24:41.200 --> 24:44.200
IRR, the internal income rate

24:44.200 --> 24:49.200
And also two parameters that use the element of discounting

24:49.200 --> 24:53.200
This is the term of the purchase and the profitability index

24:53.200 --> 24:56.200
These are the basic parameters

24:56.200 --> 25:02.200
We also considered the situation related to the multiplicity of the internal income rate

25:02.200 --> 25:07.200
And the interaction of the CAPM and VACC models

25:07.200 --> 25:11.200
I hope you remember what we talked about

25:11.200 --> 25:16.200
I would ask you to get distracted from the video course

25:16.200 --> 25:20.200
And solve the tasks that are presented in the work conspect

25:20.200 --> 25:23.200
And then we will move on to the next topic

25:23.200 --> 25:28.200
Which is related to some nuances of decision-making

25:44.200 --> 25:46.200
We continue

25:46.200 --> 25:50.200
Now I am addressing people who are in the topic

25:51.200 --> 25:58.200
We move on to study how our basic rules, our basic logic

25:58.200 --> 26:01.200
Can affect the adoption of certain current decisions

26:01.200 --> 26:06.200
For example, decisions in the part of the financial, in the part of the borrowing policy

26:06.200 --> 26:10.200
For example, in the part of the policy of balance sheets

26:10.200 --> 26:14.200
For example, in the part of the selection of sales volumes

26:14.200 --> 26:19.200
You can also talk about the credit policy

26:19.200 --> 26:26.200
Whether to provide or not to provide commercial credit to your partner

26:26.200 --> 26:31.200
You can also talk about the choice of the device

26:31.200 --> 26:36.200
Most suitable from a financial point of view for this project

26:36.200 --> 26:46.200
So, we will start this section with a question that sounds like this

26:46.200 --> 26:50.200
Which borrowing policy within the horizon of planning is better?

26:50.200 --> 26:52.200
There are two options

26:52.200 --> 26:58.200
The first option means that you attract long-term borrowing funds

26:58.200 --> 27:02.200
In the maximum volume

27:02.200 --> 27:08.200
That is, in such a maximum volume that covers all your needs with a surplus

27:08.200 --> 27:15.200
In this case, when you have free funds, and they will be most of the time

27:15.200 --> 27:24.200
In this case, you are temporarily free resources, invest in high-liquid financial assets

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
Maybe the second option

27:26.200 --> 27:31.200
When you attract long-term investments at a minimum

27:31.200 --> 27:40.200
And at the time when you have a need for borrowing funds

27:40.200 --> 27:44.200
And it will almost always arise, that is, there will be a certain shortage

27:44.200 --> 27:51.200
In this case, you will attract short-term borrowing resources from the market

27:51.200 --> 27:55.200
Both of these policies are reflected in the following two slides

27:55.200 --> 27:58.200
Pay attention, the policy of maximum

27:58.200 --> 28:02.200
That is, when you attract resources in the maximum volume

28:02.200 --> 28:08.200
So, the amount and time are reflected in this graph

28:08.200 --> 28:12.200
I mean the need for investment

28:12.200 --> 28:14.200
It is more, then less, more, then less

28:14.200 --> 28:20.200
There is a certain peak, you can attract long-term financing at this peak

28:20.200 --> 28:25.200
All that is less than this peak, but higher than the needs of your project

28:25.200 --> 28:28.200
These are temporarily free funds that you need to do something with

28:28.200 --> 28:31.200
They need to be invested in high-liquid resources

28:31.200 --> 28:37.200
The following graph shows us the policy of the minimum

28:37.200 --> 28:44.200
It means that you choose a minimum limit from your investment needs

28:44.200 --> 28:49.200
And on this minimum limit you attract long-term borrowing funds

28:49.200 --> 28:53.200
But all that will be higher, pay attention

28:53.200 --> 28:57.200
Except for one case, in all other cases on the graph

28:57.200 --> 29:01.200
You will need to attract additional borrowing funds

29:01.200 --> 29:05.200
These will be short-term, for example, bank loans

29:06.200 --> 29:10.200
The choice of two policies, which one to choose

29:10.200 --> 29:13.200
The policy of maximum or policy of minimum

29:13.200 --> 29:17.200
Depends on the cost of these resources

29:17.200 --> 29:19.200
On your costs for these resources

29:19.200 --> 29:23.200
Here the recommendation can be only in words

29:23.200 --> 29:30.200
You need to calculate the costs for one policy, the costs for the second policy

29:30.200 --> 29:33.200
Keep in mind that in the first case, the policy of maximum

29:33.200 --> 29:38.200
You will also have a profit from reinvesting in temporary funds

29:38.200 --> 29:42.200
Somewhere between these two policies will be the golden mean

29:42.200 --> 29:45.200
Where you need to choose by the method of selection

29:45.200 --> 29:50.200
How, taking into account your costs for borrowing funds and repayment from them

29:50.200 --> 29:58.200
I draw your attention to the fact that you will have a certain gap in interest rates

29:58.200 --> 30:02.200
Namely, the interest rates on which you will invest

30:02.200 --> 30:09.200
Will differ from the interest rates on which you will attract, even short-term resources

30:09.200 --> 30:11.200
And the last thing on this topic

30:11.200 --> 30:16.200
Why do we generally divide long-term investment and short-term?

30:16.200 --> 30:18.200
Why do we highlight two policies?

30:18.200 --> 30:21.200
The fact is that, I think it should also be obvious to you

30:21.200 --> 30:24.200
That the interest rate on long-term resources

30:24.200 --> 30:27.200
And the interest rate on short-term resources

30:27.200 --> 30:29.200
Are different from each other

30:29.200 --> 30:35.200
Due to the fact that there is less risk in short-term loans

30:35.200 --> 30:40.200
Therefore, the interest rate there should theoretically be lower than in the long-term

30:40.200 --> 30:45.200
The next point is related to the management of balance sheets

30:45.200 --> 30:49.200
The basic question that sounds here is the following

30:49.200 --> 30:53.200
What should be the desired level of money on the accounts?

30:53.200 --> 31:01.200
This intersects with the previous question regarding the choice of financing policy

31:01.200 --> 31:08.200
There are a number of models that suggest you calculate

31:08.200 --> 31:14.200
What should be the recommended balance sheet balance

31:14.200 --> 31:18.200
Please note that here and in the Work Consultation

31:18.200 --> 31:28.200
There is a set of formulas that you can use in your work

31:28.200 --> 31:32.200
I will only add one point

31:32.200 --> 31:35.200
I will not comment on the formula, it is quite obvious

31:35.200 --> 31:37.200
I will only add the following

31:37.200 --> 31:47.200
It makes sense to determine the time when you have a profit or a deficit of funds

31:47.200 --> 31:54.200
After you determine this, discount them all

31:54.200 --> 31:56.200
Calculate their given value

31:56.200 --> 32:03.200
Determine the NPV, the NPV analog for the deficit and the proficit of funds on the account

32:03.200 --> 32:08.200
Then you will find out, in general, on the horizon of planning

32:08.200 --> 32:11.200
Do you have excess or lack of resources?

32:12.200 --> 32:22.200
If you break this period into separate parts, you will see when you need to create a reserve

32:22.200 --> 32:25.200
If you have a deficit ahead

32:25.200 --> 32:35.200
Or there is an opportunity to invest resources if you have a profit of financial resources ahead

32:35.200 --> 32:39.200
In any case, the general approach is the same as in the previous item

32:39.200 --> 32:46.200
You discount the deficit and the proficit and try to find the NPV analog

32:46.200 --> 32:54.200
If you consider these two points preparatory, then now it's more interesting

32:54.200 --> 33:01.200
More interesting is called providing or not providing a loan to a client

33:02.200 --> 33:07.200
This is a topic that concerns all enterprises without exception

33:07.200 --> 33:18.200
Many times enterprises face the fact that the client asks for a loan for some reason

33:18.200 --> 33:22.200
And sometimes the client leaves without receiving a loan

33:23.200 --> 33:31.200
Sometimes, after receiving a loan, the client is so happy that he buys more or becomes a regular client

33:31.200 --> 33:39.200
Let's consider two situations related to credit policy

33:39.200 --> 33:44.200
For both situations, we will have some general parameters

33:44.200 --> 33:50.200
Please pay attention to the slide related to credit policy

33:50.200 --> 33:53.200
We will have several variables

33:53.200 --> 33:55.200
The first is the price of the product

33:55.200 --> 33:59.200
We will take the figure of 35 units for calculation

33:59.200 --> 34:01.200
The price of the product is the digit P

34:01.200 --> 34:03.200
V is the variable costs

34:03.200 --> 34:08.200
The letter P is the probability that the client will not pay it after receiving the loan

34:08.200 --> 34:10.200
I repeat again

34:10.200 --> 34:14.200
This is the probability that the client will not pay it after receiving the loan

34:14.200 --> 34:17.200
And finally, R is the profitability

34:17.200 --> 34:20.200
Let's look at the debitor's debt

34:20.200 --> 34:22.200
The first situation

34:22.200 --> 34:27.200
The client will buy only if he receives a loan

34:27.200 --> 34:30.200
This is a tough situation

34:30.200 --> 34:34.200
The client will buy only if he receives a loan

34:34.200 --> 34:36.200
Otherwise, he will refuse

34:36.200 --> 34:39.200
What does the company have in this case?

34:39.200 --> 34:42.200
It has two situations

34:42.200 --> 34:46.200
In the first situation, it has two ways to develop the event

34:46.200 --> 34:53.200
The first is that the company refuses to provide a loan to the client

34:53.200 --> 34:57.200
who wants only a loan, otherwise he will refuse

34:57.200 --> 34:59.200
The company refuses

34:59.200 --> 35:03.200
In this case, it has no increase in cash flows

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
Everything is zero

35:05.200 --> 35:11.200
The second situation is when the company goes to meet this client and gives him a loan

35:12.200 --> 35:18.200
In this case, the company spends only the variable costs

35:18.200 --> 35:26.200
but plans to get a certain amount of cash flow in return

35:26.200 --> 35:28.200
Pay attention to the slide

35:28.200 --> 35:38.200
The cash flow is 1-P multiplied by the price of the product

35:39.200 --> 35:43.200
Again, 1-P multiplied by the price of the product

35:43.200 --> 35:50.200
This is the calculated amount of cash flow that the company will receive from the client

35:50.200 --> 35:52.200
given that the client may not pay

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
We have a probability that the client will not pay in the amount of P

35:56.200 --> 35:58.200
I repeat again

35:58.200 --> 36:03.200
If the company gives a loan, it risks its variable costs

36:03.200 --> 36:08.200
but in return, it receives a price of the product multiplied by 1-P

36:08.200 --> 36:13.200
This is the calculated revenue from this client

36:13.200 --> 36:19.200
Now, if we put all these numbers together, we can build a formula

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
Pay attention to the slide

36:21.200 --> 36:26.200
The logic is the same as everywhere

36:26.200 --> 36:30.200
NPV is the difference between income and expenses

36:30.200 --> 36:33.200
Our expenses are the current variable costs

36:33.200 --> 36:35.200
They go with a minus sign

36:35.200 --> 36:37.200
Minus V

36:37.200 --> 36:38.200
Plus

36:38.200 --> 36:43.200
Next is the discounted payment

36:43.200 --> 36:44.200
I repeat again

36:44.200 --> 36:49.200
This is a one-time client who will refuse to buy if he is not given a loan

36:49.200 --> 36:51.200
but may not pay

36:52.200 --> 36:59.200
So, a one-time client who pays us money for this deal

36:59.200 --> 37:03.200
In the end, the NPV of this decision

37:03.200 --> 37:05.200
whether to give him a loan or not

37:05.200 --> 37:07.200
looks like this

37:07.200 --> 37:11.200
If we use the numbers we had

37:11.200 --> 37:17.200
we get the line that says NPV is equal to minus 15 and so on

37:17.200 --> 37:22.200
If we take a 30% number

37:22.200 --> 37:28.200
Let's say 30% of clients do not pay even after receiving a loan

37:28.200 --> 37:30.200
They refuse to pay

37:30.200 --> 37:36.200
30% of clients are not reliable

37:36.200 --> 37:41.200
Even in this case, the NPV of this decision will be greater than 0

37:41.200 --> 37:46.200
So, if you give a loan

37:46.200 --> 37:48.200
often enough

37:48.200 --> 37:52.200
to consider it a statistically significant action

37:52.200 --> 37:57.200
then even with 30% of non-payers

37:57.200 --> 38:00.200
you will still have a positive flow of resources

38:00.200 --> 38:03.200
This decision will be correct

38:04.200 --> 38:11.200
By the way, to fix this moment

38:11.200 --> 38:15.200
you can pause now and calculate

38:15.200 --> 38:20.200
Try to determine at what value of Pi

38:20.200 --> 38:22.200
that is, the number of non-payers

38:22.200 --> 38:25.200
at what value of Pi the NPV will be zero

38:25.200 --> 38:28.200
That is, above what value of Pi

38:28.200 --> 38:31.200
non-payers cannot give a loan

38:31.200 --> 38:33.000
Please, calculate
