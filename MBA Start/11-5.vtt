00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What is B2B?

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
It is an unusual industry called B2B or industrial marketing.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Many companies are engaged in this business.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
It is from this business that the business of medium and small businesses in the regions of Russia began.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
Companies began to sell raw materials, components, machines, equipment, tractors and much more.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
So, B2B marketing.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
A few words about the specifics of positioning, but first the definition.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
Industrial marketing is a concept describing the marketing of goods and services, organization for organization, business to business.

00:41.000 --> 00:51.000
Organization in this case means the organization of all types, commercial, non-commercial, private, public, state, manufacturers and sellers.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
There are features of the buyer's behavior in industrial marketing that determine how the positioning should be built.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
The first feature is that potential buyers can be individually identified.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
We know exactly who will buy from us, unlike B2C marketing, where we do not understand who will come to the store and who will take our product off the shelf.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
The second difference is that the decision-making process is organized.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Each company has certain procedures in accordance with which the company makes decisions.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
When we talk about marketing, for this industry, we must understand that it must help us make decisions in our favor.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
The third feature is that the purchase is carried out professionally.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Of course, this cannot be said about all companies that buy our products.

01:43.000 --> 01:54.000
But in general, we assume that when we sell an industrial product, we face a system in which people participate, who call themselves professionals.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
They use some criteria that are important to them.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
And the fourth is the high probability of a repeat purchase.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
Maybe this is the happiest time when the company has come to the point that its customers have become permanent customers.

02:10.000 --> 02:23.000
The efforts to find new customers are slowing down, and the company receives current revenues without increasing its efforts and energy to find new customers.

02:23.000 --> 02:38.000
This slide shows the specifics of marketing, industrial and consumer, and shows the future of Russian companies that work in both marketing.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
Look, from the point of view of the product, the development of products in the system of industrial marketing is linear.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Computers are improving, their capacity is increasing, the production of equipment is increasing.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
In consumer marketing, everything happens in a cyclical manner.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Men wear suits with three buttons, then two, then one, then three again.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
This cyclicity is repeated with slight fluctuations.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
Therefore, the second element of the product that strikes us and makes us adapt is the incentive.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
In industrial marketing, technology is very important.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Technology, how everything is built, what we give, how we change.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
In consumer marketing, fashion is important, and therefore a marketer is required to form fashion.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
A consumer in industrial marketing chooses based on objective criteria.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Objective criteria are difficult to break.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
In consumer marketing, people choose based on subjective criteria.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
When you sell clothes, you understand that people have the most diverse criteria.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
One likes brown, the other likes red, the third likes gray, the fourth likes blue.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It is difficult for us to choose, but this determines our marketing activity.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
And finally, look, consumers in industrial marketing usually use the left hemisphere.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
It is assumed that they are very rational, they compare the criteria of choice, and then say,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
we will buy the product from this company.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Consumer marketing has such a property.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
We know that in many cases the client is irrational.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
He is guided by the right hemisphere, and this hemisphere controls our emotions.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
And finally, two more aspects that always interest me.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
The macro-cultural aspect.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
Two cultures. In industrial marketing, science is very important.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
Your promotion, your positioning should look scientific.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
And in consumer marketing, art is important.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
And finally, another cultural aspect.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
If in industrial marketing the scope is global,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
it means that everything that is created in the West, in the field of technology,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
in the field of computerization, sooner or later comes to us.

05:11.000 --> 05:20.000
With small changes, the consumer sector demonstrates a huge specificity related to cultural boundaries.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
This means that the marketer should understand the countries in which he lives.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
The conclusion that I will make now is very unusual.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
I predict that in industrial marketing, in the conditions of globalization,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
and the entry of Russia into the world trade organization,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
it will be difficult for many marketologists.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Because they do not determine anything significant.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And what is developed there will be duplicated here.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
But I am sure that the workplace of a marketer in consumer marketing will remain for the Russians.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Because no one, as a Russian, knows the specifics of this culture.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And I do not think that neither the French, nor the Americans, nor the Germans

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
can interpret the stimulating motives of consumers better than, for example, Russian marketologists.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
And finally, the last analogy of professions.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
If industrial marketing is more about lawyers and doctors,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
then consumer marketing is about politicians and showmen.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I always look at this picture and say,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
where would you like to do marketing?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
What would you like to do in marketing?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Consumer or industrial?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
And I am often told, of course, consumer.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
It is very uninteresting and ambiguous, and, one might say,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
it is forecasted by industrial marketing.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But that is why it determines that there are certain difficulties

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
related to segmentation and positioning of products.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
For industrial marketing, for the B2B sector,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
what is called the point of contact is very important.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Any promotion is built on this.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
And I would like to say that if you work in this area,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
then maybe the most important thing you should do

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
is, first, to determine the market segments,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
which we talked about at the beginning of our lesson,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
and then to say what are the points of contact with the clients,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
with those rational clients who accept based on certain objective criteria.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Look at my example, which shows that

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
when we sell equipment, metals, raw materials, components,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
we must understand that we should have a good website,

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
a good office, good business cards that we give to our clients,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
we should look good at the exhibitions we participate in,

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
we should set up a place for sale, especially our negotiating place,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and finally we should have a suitable advertising,

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
which is often very irrational and explains to the client why it should come.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
I say this because maybe this is the basis of promotion.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Do not build illusions that industrial marketing will never be like consumer marketing.

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
It is much more boring and irrational, but it has its own charm.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Even in this you should apply the elements of art,

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
show the beauty and value of the brand you offer to the market.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
This is the essence of positioning.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Positioning is solved in some small operations,

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
which are related to the fact that the client should see the distinctive features of your company

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
and differentiate it by the office, by the website, by the business cards, by the exhibitions,

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
by the negotiating place, that is, the place of sale and by your advertising.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
And finally, the most interesting thing.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
In 2000, two researchers Rust and Lehmann for the first time proposed an unusual concept

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
that will be different from what we call marketing in B2B,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
namely the concept of consumer capital.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
What is it?

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
The authors consider consumer capital as a set of separate controllable factors,

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
and consumers themselves as the company's financial asset.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
This is such an unusual view,

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
because traditionally marketing assumes that we have goods and services that need to be sold to the client.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
They saw for the first time a different value when we work in industrial marketing.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
The client often buys.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
And what should be done to remove the word goods and concentrate on consumers?

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
The term they have chosen is very interesting, consumer capital.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And for me, the conclusion is very important.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
The danger of slave-like pursuit of product profitability without a focus on the consumer.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
So what should be done to make our consumer our capital,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
to make him bring more and more money?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
There are certain rules for this.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Three rules that must be followed.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
If I want to adjust,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
then we must build our positioning and differentiation

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
on the basis of three controllable factors of consumer capital.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
The first factor is called the capital of value.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
The second factor is called the capital of the brand.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
And the third factor is the capital of retention.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
In all three factors there is a differentiation of the company

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
that we must carry through this policy towards our clients.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
The first factor is the capital of value.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
What does it mean?

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
When a client wants to buy a product from an industrial enterprise,

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
he always weighs certain offers.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Be it our offer with the offer of competitors,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
or offers with your desired factors,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
for example, with your budget.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
This is the first one.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
The capital of value is very important when,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
for example, the monetary value of the loyalty program is very high.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And two other factors are very important

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
when the relationship of the learner between the consumer and the company

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
is very strong.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
So I wanted to show you that there are certain rules

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
that suggest that if you want to attract for the first time,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
you should think about what to do

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
to try to limit the movement of our client

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
and go to another supplier.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Remember, the first offer is very important,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
so that your offer is much more profitable than the competitor's.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Remember that if you do not have a good loyalty program,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
then the capital of value should be very significant.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Remember that if you create a training type of relationship with the client

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
as an element of the initial offer,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
this also creates a strong connection.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Remember that you must create such conditions

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
so that it is very difficult for the client to switch to your competitor.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
How can you increase the capital of value?

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
There are a few ways, but the simplest one is to offer a higher value to the consumer.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Quality and convenience, or offer the same value as the competitor,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
but at a lower price.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Whatever we do, we should start from the following.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
When we create an offer on the market,

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
we should say that yes, we can sell the same thing at a higher price,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
but then we lower the capital of value

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
and remove one of the elements of consumer capital,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
which is very important for our business.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Next slide.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
The second element.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Whatever we offer on the market, at what price,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
we will always be present in the market of price competition

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
if we do not recognize that another factor that affects our choice is the brand.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
This is especially important for those companies

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
that are difficult to assess the quality of the product or service before purchase.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
For example, it is very difficult to assess the service in marketing.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Yes, services can also be B2B.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Services can also be for B2B industries, for example.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
We hold seminars, we consult enterprises.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
In fact, we work in the B2B industry and at the same time this service.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
It is very difficult to assess the quality of the product or service in the first place.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
And so when we talk about how much it can cost,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
we must say if we have the capital of the brand.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
If we do not have it, we will always have to sell at the lowest price.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
And we compete with the same companies that sell at a low price

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
and therefore offer another damping.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Compare the brands that are here.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I wanted to show you.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Tell me which of these pens is better?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Visconti, Omas, Waterman or Parker?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
In principle, there is nothing in these pens.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
But people who buy them probably refer to the brand and its fame to a greater extent.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
In the same way, it is sometimes very important for many companies to spend money on the brand.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
Western companies allocate huge budgets to form the image of the brand.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Russian companies that sell metal say,

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
why pay the percentage to the seller and not do anything else?

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
Remember, we are slowly pushing ourselves into the abyss of price competition.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
And in the end, the day will come when we will be put off the market.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
And yet, let's go back to this slide.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Tell me which of the pens you like better.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
What do you think, what has this pen achieved?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
What has it created?

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
The capital of the brand for itself.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Next slide.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
Three roles of the capital of the brand that are very important.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
The brand is important for the B2B industry,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
and to a lesser extent for B2C,

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
because it acts as a magnet attracting new consumers to the company.

15:40.000 --> 15:49.000
For example, Volvo and Scania became the market for commercial vehicles in Russia.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
People want to buy Volvo trucks, people want to buy Volvo buses.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
And it's hard to explain, because from a rational point of view,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
these are very expensive buses and trucks,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
but for some reason people in Russia prefer them.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Volvo is just a small part of this market segment.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
And of course, competitors who want to push Volvo face problems.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
How to do it?

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
They often dump, lowering prices, but Volvo doesn't lose its share of the market.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Because Volvo created what we call the capital of the brand.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Second.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Our brand acts as a business card for reminding people about goods and services.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
This brand helps us, helps marketers to promote this product.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
But the most important thing is that sellers are most grateful for this brand,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
because they have to contact customers,

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
and they often have to explain why the same product costs more.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And finally, the last one.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
The brand usually provides emotional connection between the consumer and the company.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
It creates something invisible that makes people turn to this product.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Pay attention to how you are dressed.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
We are a tool of brand policy, a tool of marketing.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Someone ties us to some brand,

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
what watches we wear, what clothes we wear.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
In the same way, we face problems in industrial marketing.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
The consumer often says,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
no, we should use these trucks.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
It is difficult to convince Coca-Cola in Russia that it should not use Volvo trucks.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
Because there is an emotional connection between the consumer and the company,

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
which was created by Volvo back then in the Western market.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
And today the company does not even want to consider the question of alternatives.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
There are certain rules that say that when we think about how to adjust to competitors,

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
we should measure the brand that adjusts, differentiates us.

17:55.000 --> 18:05.000
I liked that the authors of this model said that if you want to understand whether the brand differentiates you or not,

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
measure the awareness of the brand,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
the emotions that the brand causes,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
the attitude to the brand,

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
whether people are happy, happy, proud, or just laughing,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
and finally, the brand ethics.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
The most painful thing in Russia is that we have to face such a situation.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
We are well aware, even better in emotions,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
and ready to generate absolutely creative,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
absolutely new creative ideas related to advertising.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
But we do not want to notice the brand ethics.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I think that sooner or later,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
a company that uses so-called scandalous marketing,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
provocative marketing,

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
will face the problem that Russian consumers will begin to evaluate the brand ethics.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
And the most important, perhaps the last element, is differentiation.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
The differentiation of industrial marketing includes another very important element.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
It is especially necessary in the third component of the company's work,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
which works in B2B industries,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
which is the capital retention program.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
It is not enough to offer a good product at a reasonable price.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
It is not enough to create a brand that is valuable to the client.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It is also important to create a loyalty program,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
which is called the capital retention company.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
What is capital retention?

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
This is a tendency shown by the consumer in the form of preference for the brand,

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
without being explained by the objective and subjective assessments of this brand.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It's just incredible.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
How can you explain why a client wants to buy from this company?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Why does he not want to switch to another company?

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
Indeed, it is even difficult to ask why,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
because people do not think about it.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
It is the Russians who express such a point of view for the first time.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
If you want to be a successful company,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
think about how to keep your clients.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
Of course, there are Russian companies that are inclined to measure the loyalty of the client

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
by various types of sales and discounts.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
I believe that is why people come to them again and again.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
But in reality, we are still facing an unusual situation.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
As a rule, loyalty programs for many Russian companies are negative.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
We want to accept that there are preferences

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
that are not explained by objective assessments, but by something else.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
What is it?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Companies build up their capital retention,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
offering their consumers benefits,

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
which make it more expensive for them to switch to the product of their competitors.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
What does this mean in reality?

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
We create such working conditions for the client,

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
which implies that if our client switches to our competitor

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
and starts buying his product,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
he faces inexplicable difficulties from the point of view of the consumer.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
For example, discomfort in communication,

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
discomfort in filling in the forms,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
discomfort in explaining the situation, and much more.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
I came across an unusual case in Russia,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
when one of the companies said,

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
we are ready to go to the point where our customers

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
even develop a supply plan,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
what they need for the entire program.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Imagine how the company serves the client deeply,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
how deeply it concerns its needs,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
that, for example, employees who work at the company of the buyer

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
are ready to give their own function,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
for example, the calculation of the needs in metal,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
which is completed by another organization,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
knowing that it will do it better.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
In general, such parasitization of the supplier's competencies

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
leads to the fact that the client is very connected,

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
because if this supplier leaves,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
he will have to develop the program himself.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I'm not used to doing this anymore,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm used to demonstrating it in the best possible way,

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
for example, in PowerPoint, in front of the board of directors.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
Secondly, in order to connect the client,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
in order not to give him the opportunity to switch to our competitors,

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
there are several ways in accordance with the model of consumer capital.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
The first is various options for rewarding repeated purchases.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Yes, the client understands that if I buy the next purchase,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I have some benefits,

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
and therefore it is not profitable to start a new purchase from a new competitor.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
The second is sponsorship programs.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
It is the supplier who is interested in sponsoring the enterprise of the buyer in various ways.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
Sponsorship programs imply that we participate in some kind of sponsorship activities

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
to help children, for example, pensioners of this enterprise.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
We sponsor various kinds of holidays.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
We help those who have left the factory and much more.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
The second is a program of stimulation,

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
which allows to strengthen the emotional attachment of the company's consumer.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
I think that this emotional attachment is often explained

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
when a company starts to create various kinds of training programs,

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
programs for the development of staff.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
Therefore, for example, it is very important in B2B to have such an activity

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
as, for example, free seminars,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
invitation to conferences,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
to show that we are not just selling goods,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
but we are developing the business,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
expanding the idea of the buyer, for example,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
about where to go and how to go.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
I have had to give a speech at such seminars more than once,

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
where, as a rule, the suppliers are ready to hold business seminars for their consumers

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
so that they realize how to work better in the market and how to earn more money.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
The supplier is then sure that their sales will increase,

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
and the consumer's sales will increase, and the supplier's sales will increase.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And the last slide.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
And finally, how should differentiation be manifested?

24:25.000 --> 24:34.000
Differentiation in B2B is manifested in the most unpretentious promotion activities,

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
namely in PR, in newspaper ads, in professional press,

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
in direct marketing, in reference books, in exhibitions, brochures,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
audio and video materials, in various materials of computer order,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
in sales promotion and in gifts.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
From here, starting from PR, we must feel that the company is differentiated

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
and all the time reflects its specificity in these advertising materials or promotion materials,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
which is excellent for the competitor.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
Only then can we say that differentiation in B2B has achieved its result.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
It is difficult, but each of these elements should bear the idea, including the slogan,

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
which is developed on the basis of differentiation.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
I have a crown phrase that says that everything good ends.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
I have finished my lesson, and in conclusion I want to say that the tools of strategic marketing,

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
namely segmentation, the choice of target segments and positioning,

25:34.000 --> 25:42.000
are very important tools to create confidence that the company will exist further in the market,

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
that it will not be swept away by the waves of competition.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Remember my course, when you have to think about what to do with clients,

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
how to compete with new players that appear on your market.

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
But the most important thing is that this way you get an unconventional solution,

26:05.000 --> 26:13.000
which is difficult to repeat, because it is more difficult to repeat the intellectual activity of people,

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
it is easier to repeat the products of technology.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Thank you very much. Good luck in your business.
