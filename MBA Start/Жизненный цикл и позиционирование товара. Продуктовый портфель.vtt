00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, my name is Andrey Kulinich.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
I have been engaged in both theoretical and practical aspects of marketing for more than a year.

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
Today's course, the life cycle and positioning of the product, the product portfolio, included almost all my experience on this topic.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
In this course, we will talk about the first section, the product, concept, form and characteristics.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
The second section is about the accompanying goods and services.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
The third section is about the life cycle of the goods and markets.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
The fourth section is about the assortment policy of the company, what the product portfolio should be.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Let's outline the goals of this course.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
First of all, we should learn how to properly form the product policy of the company,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
which means to master the skills of both analysis and planning of the product portfolio.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
To do this, we need to understand the life cycle of the goods, characteristics of the goods,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
and to master the methods of working with different types of products, to understand their features.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
So, the traditional definition of the goods is the material or non-material benefit sold to the company.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
But this definition has been transformed, changed and changed over time.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
And now the most relevant definition is any offer presented on the market,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
be it a material benefit or a service.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
That is, everything you can exchange, offer to the market, is now understood as a product.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
In particular, it is not necessarily a certain item, it is either a service or information.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
There are two extremes.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
These are material goods and non-material goods.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
But the world is not divided into black and white.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
In fact, there are both material goods, like the remote control I hold in my hands.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
There are goods that are a companion to the service.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
In particular, the hotel business is nothing more than a commodity that accompanies the service.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
The information that is a carrier.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
When you buy a newspaper, you do not buy it for the paper.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
No, no, paper will also come in handy in the household, no doubt.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
But the main thing is that what is written in this newspaper is information.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
A CD, music is not a carrier.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
That is, we buy a carrier.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
In this case, a material product is nothing more than a carrier of a non-material service, an inedible product.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
On the other hand, there are services for providing goods.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
In particular, when you buy a car, you will have to contact a car dealer.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
He provides services for delivering, providing goods to you.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
It makes the goods available.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Services that accompany the goods.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Construction.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
If you build a private house, you actually order a construction service.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
But in the end you get a product.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
A house, a cottage, a bathhouse.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Inedible services.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
In particular, any consulting services are inedible.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
You cannot feel them, try to assess them.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
It is important to understand that any product or service has not only a material or informational value,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
but also a symbolic value.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Pay attention to the slide.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
A seemingly simple product like a prunes has a deep symbolic value.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
Looking at it, we have associations with old age, wrinkles, impotence.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
All this limits the sale, stops the buyer from buying.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
But there are also positive emotions, positive symbolism.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Expensive cars, watches, rolexes are symbols.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
These are symbols belonging to a certain class, wealth and power.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
If you look at the goods in a broader way, you will see several aspects.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
First of all, it is the concept of the goods.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
The essence.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
In the future, this concept will be surrounded by components of the goods.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
That is, they will be divided into separate functions, properties and characteristics.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Sensory unity.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
These are tactile sensations.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Taste, smell, what kind of product to touch.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
We must discuss and write down these aspects.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Packaging.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
The product is extremely important.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
From the point of view of the choice of this product for the customer,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
and from the point of view of promotion, from the point of view of its availability on the shelf of the store.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
The overall quality of the offer.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Here it is necessary to consider not only the essence of the product,

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
but also the packaging and services that may accompany this product.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
What services will the consumer need when purchasing this product?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
The accompanying services.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Some of them, we will talk about a little later, will be included in the free basic package.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
What can a customer buy with an additional fee?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
The trademark.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
This is also an important aspect of the product.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
In fact, the product is a large number of questions.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
The auxiliary device, the name of the brand, how we will process the claims,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
what size will our product be, in what packaging, instructions,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
what will be written on the packaging, what warranty period will we provide, design.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
All these questions we need to solve when we decide to restart the product on the market.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
But it starts, first of all, with positioning the product.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
What is the position of the product?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
This is how your product is perceived by the customer.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
This is the position in his head.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
This is not how you imagine or want to position your product.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
In no case.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
This is exactly how your product is perceived by the customer.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
It is important to understand.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
It's like a clue.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Think, remember.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
If you were choosing a reliable car now, which three brands come to your mind?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
These are the positions.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
If you were choosing a good hotel, which three hotel names come to your mind?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
These are the clues.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
These are the positions of the product.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
There are three ways to determine the position of the product.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
First, it is a reinforcement of the position already found in the head of the consumer.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
How they perceive it.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Great.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It is much easier to work with this.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
It is important to inform the consumer that we are who we are.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
To consolidate this position.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Search for a free niche among competitors.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Through differentiation.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Through differences.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
We look at the products on the market.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
How they are positioned.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
How they are perceived by the customers.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
What products are missing?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
What positions are still available?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Accordingly, we can put our product on this position.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
The third option is to replace the competitor with a certain position.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The process is not easy, but possible.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
So, positioning is possible.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
First of all, based on emotional values.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
And considering the reduction of the importance of differentiation,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
the products become very similar to each other.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
The emotional aspect is now very often the first priority.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
The price-quality ratio.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
The perceived quality, the price, is also an important aspect that we will talk about.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Why not?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
From the point of view of use.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
Where, how, on what issues is a particular product used.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Positioning should be done taking into account the needs of the product.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
The needs of the customer.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
The needs of the competitors.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
The needs of the positions that are occupied by the competitors.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And the product class.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Price, emotional, and so on.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
What is your product?

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Why is positioning necessary?

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
First of all, to answer what position we occupy.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
And where should we put our efforts?

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
A product that has no position usually has no sustainable growth prospects.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Positioning is not segmentation.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
It is a refusal of something for the better service of the clients for whom your position is important.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
Quality is a bad basis for positioning.

08:32.000 --> 08:41.000
The theory of positioning was developed by two scientists, L. Rice and Jack Trout.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
You can find more detailed information in their books.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
But first of all, they stated, and I agree with them, that quality is a bad basis for positioning.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Why?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Because we perceive quality in a completely different way.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Say, Mercedes is a reliable car.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I am sure that I will not be divided.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Moreover, if I ask you why you decided that the quality is great or negative,

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
it will turn out that almost each of you judged by your own criteria.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
The number of breakdowns on a thousand sold cars,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
service life, color, metal, engine sound,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
quality of interior upholstery,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
quality of acoustics in the car.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
There can be many criteria for quality.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
Therefore, the quality is a rather soft criterion and does not fit the point of view of positioning.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But what can we take as a basis?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
We can take the product itself.

09:39.000 --> 09:49.000
The shape of the product or its properties can be a great way to differentiate from competitors

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
and, accordingly, to position in the consumer's head.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Pay attention, Apple is trying to adjust to this.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
That is, interesting shapes, unique design,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
product properties, convenient to use.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Look at the success of Apple.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
It not only leads in the field of computers for professional designers,

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
but it also occupies niches of quite expensive portable audio equipment,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I mean MP3 players.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
It has become a cellular communication.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It is these competencies that use their position.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
The efficiency of use, comfort of use,

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
and durability of the product can also serve as a basis for positioning.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Services can be a great basis for positioning.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The world is accelerating, accelerating.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Often we are looking for simple, quick solutions.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
The simplicity of ordering.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
The simplicity of ordering a book through an Internet site.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
The simplicity of payment by mobile phone.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
The simplicity of receiving a bank loan.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
Receiving a loan can serve as a basis for positioning,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
as a basis for differentiating from competitors.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Let's give an example.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Now many banks, on the one hand,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
complicate the requirements to the borrower,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
and on the other hand,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
they try to tell us that it is easy to receive an order.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
For example, Delta Credit.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
They say that it is enough for you to come to their bank only twice.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
The first time is to provide documents,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
the second time is to sign or make a deal.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
That's it. It's very simple.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
They don't take your time.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
This distinguishes them from many competitors

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
and long trips to the bank,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
communication, standing in lines.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Delivery.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Pay attention.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Many stores are now saying that it is not cheap,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
but we deliver goods within three hours.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Not three days, but three hours.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Is it important for you?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Not for everyone, not always,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
but it can also be a basis for positioning.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Staff.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
This is also a position that can be taken in the consumer's head.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
For example,

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
if you decide to focus on the segment of expats,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
foreigners in Russia,

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
then your staff speaks two, three or four languages.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Is it hard?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Maybe.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
But in this case,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
all these clients will automatically choose you,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
if they have a problem with Russian.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It is always more pleasant to communicate,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
receive services or goods,

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
and order in your native language.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Pay attention.

12:41.000 --> 12:53.000
Reliability, reliability, communication.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
All these can be a basis for positioning in the client's head.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Channel.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
It can also be a basis for positioning in the consumer's head.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
A good example is cosmetics.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It can be sold in shopping centers,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
through consultants,

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
through the so-called network channel, MLM.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
This is a way to differentiate.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It is not sold in retail.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
It can only be bought from our consultants.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Yes, the measure was forced for Avon, Mary Kay.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
They did not find a place on shelves in stores.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
But maybe this has become an important distinguishing feature.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Perhaps it was this channel,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
channel differentiation,

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
that allowed them to become one of the leaders of the cosmetic industry.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Image.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
It is definitely a basis for positioning.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Remember the recently burned down Diagilev club.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Positioning.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
The most expensive, the most glamorous.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Accordingly, this position, this offer,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
was made for the clients for whom it was important.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Yes, the club had its own atmosphere,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
and special events were held in the club.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Exclusive performances of stars,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
special party, and so on.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
What are the conditions for the correct positioning?

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Here you need to know a few rules.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
First of all, look at the sides.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
What position do your competitors occupy?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
It is desirable to find your own unique position.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
But it is important to understand

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
that this position should be important for your clients.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
To arouse interest.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Otherwise, I'm afraid

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
that you won't be able to position

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
that will bring you profit.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Accordingly, the next question.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Will this position allow you to extract enough profit?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
What segment, what purchasing power

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
will your position be important for?

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
How much can you argue your position?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
What arguments do you have to defend your position?

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
How easy is it to convey them?

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
How clear is your idea of the degree of vulnerability?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
How quickly can competitors copy this position?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
How can they undermine your position?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
What will be their counteraction?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
How does the current position coincide

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
with the existing positioning of the product?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Will you have to make a serious mistake?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
How confident are you

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
that the product corresponds to the stated position?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
There are also several important postulates

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
that you need to remember in the process of positioning.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
The first one is that human abilities are limited.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Rice et al. claim that in the head of a person

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
there are only three cells for each position.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
You remember three brands of reliable cars spontaneously.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
You remember three brands of sports cars.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
But only three come to your mind at once.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
And this three plays an important role in your choice.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
In order to take the place in the head of the consumer,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
if all three cells are occupied,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
you will have to move someone.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
So your argument, your position should be stronger,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
you should be more aggressive

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
than the competitor who occupies one of the three cells.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Although there may be obvious positions.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Remember the H&S ad.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Call the shampoo from the Perhoti number two.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
This is a hint to their competitors.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
It is important to understand that consciousness loves simplicity.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
The clearer, the easier it is to prove to you,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
the faster you will take this position.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
If you explain to the consumer

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
that your product is better in terms of the integral factor,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and so on,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Oh, how difficult!

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I don't need difficulties.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Life is not so difficult.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Just tell me what you are different from.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
Here comes to my mind the advertising concept of Budweiser beer.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
In the 1930s, they had problems with the sale of beer.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
The Czech Republic, the competitors, everyone has good beer.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
How to sell, how to differentiate, how to position?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Although there were no such terms at that time,

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
they tried to use the current approaches we are talking about.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I think that someone jokingly suggested to consultants

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
to indicate in the ad that they wash bottles.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
They wash bottles with steam.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
They indicated.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Sales have increased sharply.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
The rest had to prove that they also wash bottles.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
But it was just a weak excuse.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
The mind of a person is full of doubts.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
And you will have to prove your position every time.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
But the most important thing is to win this position.

18:17.000 --> 18:26.000
If I come to you and say that the training on MBA Start course is very high quality and effective.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
You will tell me right away why.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
You are trying to pressure me.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
You are trying to impose your opinion on me.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
And I will need to have a number of arguments to prove.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Get ready for evidence.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Get ready to translate murderous arguments to your clients.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
But the important aspect is that the mind is constant.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
If your brand has steadily taken up a certain niche,

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
it is quite difficult to remove it from there.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Which cars are the safest?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Volvo.

19:01.000 --> 19:09.000
Please note that Volvo cars are not the safest for more than a decade.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
It is the competence to make safe cars.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Other car manufacturers have also mastered it.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
But the position is so simple in our consciousness

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
that the first association is usually a safe car.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
It is Volvo.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Volkswagen, speaking of cars,

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
tried to reposition its brand and transfer it to a category.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
To one category with Mercedes and BMW.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Alas, it turned out to be extremely difficult.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Volkswagen is an inexpensive car.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
It is written in the name.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
And even a wide-scale advertising concept could not change its position.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
Many brands are suffering from such diseases.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Samsung spends billions, if I'm not mistaken,

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
2-3 billion dollars a year on global advertising budgets.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
But it cannot change the perception in the world

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
that it is not an elite or premium brand,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
but at least a strong middleman.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
The world perceives it as an inexpensive Korean car.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
And this is not the first year of the war.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
In terms of positioning,

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
extremely simple tools are used

20:28.000 --> 20:35.000
either to find a free niche or to distribute goods in the current positions.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
For example, pay attention to the site.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
This is a positioning table.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
This is a conditional market structuring,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
where we try to distribute goods in several categories.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
First of all, by price.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Expensive, acceptable, inexpensive.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
But we can also distribute food by groups.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Traditional cuisine and products similar to it.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
High-calorie food, artificial products, natural and dietary products.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Next, we look for where our competitors are.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Where is a free niche,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
or where is not enough competition,

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
where there is a place in three cells in the consumer's head.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
The most popular tool is the positioning matrix,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
or sometimes it is called the perception matrix.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
In two axes.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Most often it is the price-quality ratio.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
But it can be axes, if you return to family, sports cars,

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
or for the city, for the countryside.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Pay attention to the two axes, two extremes,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
not necessarily related to the price.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
By distributing the competitors' positions

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
by the Euler circles,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
applying the perception matrix,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
we can find positions with high competition,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
positions with low competition,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
and possibly a free niche.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
Moreover, these approaches can be used not only for market structuring,

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
but also for the structuring of your own portfolio,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
in order to distribute brands in the consumer's head.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
If you do not do this,

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
there is an internal competition, an internal cannibalism,

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
when three brands are fighting for your client's wallet,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
and all three are yours.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Why?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Why do you need this?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Your costs are three times higher,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
but you will not earn money anymore.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
It is important that the goods do not compete with each other.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
We have a good story.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
At one time, General Motors released five of its sub-brands

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
to free swimming.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
It was believed that they would be easier to survive in the market

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
due to their flexibility.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
What did the brands do?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
They tried to find the largest,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
profitable and intensively growing segment.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
It turned out to be middle-class cars.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
After a short time,

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
it turned out that all five brands,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
which had previously unique positions,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
competed in one segment due to one consumer,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
with little difference.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
General Motors lost the traditional markets for itself

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
and began to compete with itself.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
This led to certain financial problems.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
You can use profiles.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Look for the differences between your goods.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Build a profile that is different from the competitors'

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
and look for clients who will accept this profile.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
I want to repeat that positioning is a refusal of something.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Positioning is a persistent reaction of the consumer

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
to the image of your product,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
to its brand, to its name.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
It is a hint of what is associated with your product.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Have your position and your sales will grow.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
We talked about positioning.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
Now let's talk about the method of positioning,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
for example, through design.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
What options can be designed?

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
What criteria should be satisfied by design?

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
First of all, there are five main ones.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Functionality and ergonomics.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Design should be convenient for the consumer.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
It should be functional.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It should be convenient.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
Design should allow you to use your device effectively.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
On the other hand,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
if we are talking about cars,

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
design should allow engineers to place power units inside,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
to ensure the safety of passengers.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Social adaptation.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Design should meet the social group's requirements,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
in which it will be sold and distributed.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
If we talk about the middle class,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
these are the same requirements for design.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
If we talk about the high-end,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
design will have different features.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Design's appearance and appeal.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Why not?

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
But note that not all people should like design.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
What everyone likes is the same for everyone.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Identificability.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
Your product should be easily identifiable by its appearance.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Let's go back to cars.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
For many years,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
from one model to another,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
they have been moving the grilles and headlights

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
to make these products easily identifiable by consumers.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
So that you can immediately determine

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
what kind of product it is, what kind of car it is.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
If we talk about the types of design,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
then industrial design,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
product design, technological design,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
packaging design,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
which is actually an element of promotion,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
corporate design,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
which is the company's logo,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
a brand book with a description

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
of how business cards,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
advertising,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
and business cards should be designed,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
environmental design,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
or commercial architecture.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
That is, landscape design,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
design of your office,

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
and design around it.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Website design,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
or Internet design.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
If we talk about packaging,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
it is also important to say

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
that there are three types of packaging.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
The primary one

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
is the one that contacts the product itself.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Let's take a chewing gum.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
In particular,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
it is either chocolate,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
but wrapped in foil.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
That is, this is the primary packaging

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
that contacts the chocolate.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
There is another layer of packaging behind the foil.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
The secondary one.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
The secondary layer of packaging usually

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
is a product of high quality

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
and has an informational and advertising nature.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It contains the necessary information

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
about the manufacturer,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
the shelf life, the composition,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and other things.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
The third packaging,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
or what is called a transport packaging,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
serves to ensure that the product

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
is not damaged during the movement,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
or this movement can be carried out

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
more effectively.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
In particular, boxes,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
boxes for bottles,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
and so on.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
When designing,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
you should take into account

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
two important functions of packaging.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
First of all, technical protection

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and safety of the product.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
These are your losses.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Minimizing losses will allow you

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
to earn more or make a more competitive price.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
The convenience of use,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
both for end customers

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
and intermediaries.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Transport and storage

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
are very important aspects.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Why? Russia is a huge country

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
and many losses occur

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
during transportation.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Packaging allows

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
to minimize them.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Placing and utilization

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
are two aspects at the same time.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Placing is how the product can be stored

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
and where it can be in the shopping mall.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
In particular,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
if you plan to place the product

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
in the order zone,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
this is one form of packaging.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
If it is placed on shelves,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
think about how easy

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
it is to utilize your packaging

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and whether it pollutes the environment.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Potentially,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
it can become a competitive advantage.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Communication.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
In particular,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
packaging influences our choice

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
or perception of the quality of the product.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You should include

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
such elements as

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
recognizability,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
positioning,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
packaging, design.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
In this case,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
both primary and secondary packaging

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
should emphasize

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
the position of your product.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Consumer information.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
What is written

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
on the packaging?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Where is it made?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Under whose control?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
What is included in the product?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Perhaps, packaging should stimulate.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
In particular,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
if you remember,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
or if you have children,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
in the boxes with sweet balls

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
sometimes there are

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
various toys

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
or games that can be cut

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
directly from the packaging.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Such moves

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
allow to increase

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
sales, because it is attractive

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
for children.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
When designing a packaging,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
you should understand the rules of using colors.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
In fact, almost all colors

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
are perceived differently by consumers.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
They have both advantages

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
and disadvantages.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Let's look at the red one.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
On the one hand,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
it is a color that evokes passion,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
which is dynamic,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
revolutionary,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
but on the other hand

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
it is associated with blood,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
fire, war,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
the color of the devil.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Will it play a negative role

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
in terms of the perception of the product

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
or packaging by consumers?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
The white color is innocence,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
perfection,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
and on the other hand it is emptiness,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
silence, and elusiveness.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You should understand how colors combine.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
The packaging should not be overloaded

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
with colors and look like something

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
too flashy.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
It is advisable to use no more than three colors.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
There are certain tricks

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
that you can clarify with designers.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
For example,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
the best color is perceived

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
as yellow on black.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
We pick it up.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
You should understand

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
and use

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
your packaging.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Let's try to make a small building

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
for self-check.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
In particular, I will ask you

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
to classify the goods

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
offered by the restaurant

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
as goods of long-term use

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
or as services.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Explain your answer.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Task 2.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Recently, many European and American

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
car manufacturers

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
reposition their trademarks.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Think about the examples of such repositioning.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Describe how

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
a particular trademark

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
moved to the upper

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
or lower segment of the market.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
How easily did companies

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
reposition it?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
What else could they do

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
to change the attitude

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
of consumers to their cars?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
To change their position?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Task 3.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Why do most people prefer

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
trademarked goods

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
over non-trademarked ones?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Explain your answer.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Let's look at the section

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
on accompanying services.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Here we will talk about

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
how to define the list

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
of additional services

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
for your offer.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Accompanying services are a set

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
of additional services

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
that add additional value

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
to the product for the consumer

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
and are a source of possible differentiation.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
It is important to understand

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
that there are three types

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
of additional services.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The first one is

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
the reception,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
the consumer's

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
care,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the information about the offer,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
the advice on buying or consulting,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
and the processing of special cases

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
of customer's request.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Yes, the promotion of the product

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
and the message about it

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
are also important services

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
that often cannot be sold

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
without.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
The second one is the services

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
to ensure the deal.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It is the acceptance of the order

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
or the booking of the product for you,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
the payment, the receipt of money.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Let's go back to the example

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
about cars.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Here we can face

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
the information

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
that there is a similar model,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
some characteristics.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
You can get a consultation

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
when choosing a car

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
on which you should

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
stop your choice.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
When you come to the car dealership,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
you need to place the order

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
or book a car

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
that is sailing on a ferry.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
You also need to transfer the money.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
These services are provided

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
by the car dealership.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
The third one is the services

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
to ensure the customer's after-sales service.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It is related to the guarantee,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
the guarantee,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
the quality confirmation

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
or the reduction of the level of concern

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
whether you have made the purchase.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
It is the technical service,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
the processing of claims,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
as well as the promotion

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
of loyalty.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
There are three approaches

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
to the formation of the

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
after-sales package.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
The first approach is functional.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Roughly speaking,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
what additional services

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
or basic services

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
the consumer needs

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
to be able to use the product

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and purchase it.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
It is a minimalistic approach.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
The second approach is the client approach.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
What services are valuable for the client

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
and what services are valuable for the client?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
What does the client expect to see

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
along with the product?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
What services does the client want to receive?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The third approach is competitive.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
In this case,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
we try to adjust

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
the services

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
from our competitor.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
For example,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
we offer free service as a basic service.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
We can offer it for money.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
It is possible to differentiate

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
our offer.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
The third approach is a few-level service.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
In particular,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
it is the core of the offer.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
It is what we offer to the consumer

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and what is the basis.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Next, it is surrounded by basic

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
accompanying services.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Without them,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
the core loses its value

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
and cannot be provided to the consumer.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Additional free accompanying services

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
are what we offer to the client

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
based on the three approaches

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
we have mentioned above.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
They are functional, competitive,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
and client-based.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Additional free accompanying services

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
can be provided to the consumer

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
for money and additional fee.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Cars are a good example.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
A car is a core of the offer.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
However,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
without basic accompanying services

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
such as consulting,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
receiving an order,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
booking, and receiving a fee,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
we cannot purchase it.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Therefore, a car is inextricably linked

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
to the services.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Additional free services

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
are what we can provide to the consumer.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
In particular,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
it is pre-sale preparation of the car,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
it is possible

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
to consult

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
after the sale

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
on the use of the car,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and so on.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Additional services

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
that we can provide to the consumer

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
are installation

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
of additional equipment,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
it is possible

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
to treat the car

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
with anti-corrosion components

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
if it is necessary.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
There are several stages,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
to be exact, five,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
which allow us to determine

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
the policy of the accompanying services.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
First of all,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
we should determine

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
what our clients expect from us.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It is quite possible

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
that depending on the client segment

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
the set of basic and additional services

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
will be different.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Second, we should analyze

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
the ability of the company

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
to perform these services

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
and assess the costs

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
that we will incur.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Third, we should determine

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
additional services

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
that will be included

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
in the basic set

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
and that we will provide separately

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
for additional fee.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Fourth, we should consider

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
the possibility of differentiating

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
between the different segments.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
It is possible that depending on the client type

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
we can offer something

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
in the basic set,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
something with additional fee.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
For another client,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
this set will be different.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And, of course, fifth,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
we should develop a program

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
of providing these services,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
organize internal processes,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
if it is not possible within the company,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
find partners to outsource

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
these processes.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I would like to ask you

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
to complete a small task.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Remember the recently purchased

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
expensive goods,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
furniture, household appliances,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
interior items,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and what types of

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
accompanying services

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
were marked by you

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
in the purchase process.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Life cycle of goods and markets

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Let's move on to the third section

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
of the Life Cycle of Goods and Markets.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Here we will consider the concept

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
of the life cycle

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and try to learn

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
to use it in practice.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
The life cycle

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
is a beautiful graph

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
that reflects the volume

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
of product sales

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
on the market

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
depending on its shelf life.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
It is important to understand

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
that everything appears

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
and disappears.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It is a dialectic of our life.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
There are peaks,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
which reach the volume of sales,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
there are stages

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
which reach the peak

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
and then decrease the volume of sales.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Each stage has

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
its own actions

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
or optimal actions

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
of the company

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
that allow you to achieve the maximum effect.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
In particular,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
one of the problems of the life cycle

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
is that there is no formula

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
that allows you to calculate

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
where you are on this graph,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
at what stage of the life cycle

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
your product or market is.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
You can determine it by indirect signs.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
At the launch stage,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
as a rule, sales are very difficult,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
no one is familiar with the product yet,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the acquisition of each client

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
is very expensive,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
there are few competitors,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
but the segmentation and positioning

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
of this product is not yet clear.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
At the stage of rapid growth,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
a rough segmentation is already taking place,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
that is, a fairly simplified one.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
The product, perhaps,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
is being finalized

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
taking into account the first

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
sales experience,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the volume of sales is growing rapidly,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
the cost of acquisition of the client is decreasing.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
At the stage of maturity,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
as a rule,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
the competition is getting bigger,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
the products are starting to differ

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
between each other,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
the segmentation is already detailed

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
and the competition on the market

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
is quite high.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
On the declining market,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
as a rule, the competition is also decreasing,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
but the number of offers

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
of companies that survive

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
is extremely small.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Let's look at the life cycle

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
using the example of mobile phones.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
For example, in the late 90s

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
in any cell phone salon

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
it was considered a good offer

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
if there were about 10 models,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
if simplified,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
each manufacturer

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
had 2 models of the phone.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Expensive and inaccessible.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
If you look at cell phone salons now,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
you will see that the range

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
from 10 positions

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
has grown to several hundred.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
And this is a very good

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
result.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Several hundred.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The range of some manufacturers

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
reaches

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
50-60 models of phones.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
That is,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
at the first stage, sales were small,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
products were poorly differentiated,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
that is, the segmentation

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
of clients was quite rough

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
and simplified.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Expensive and inexpensive phones.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Then, at the stage of growth

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
and the number of manufacturers increased,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
competition increased,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and the market improved.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Now, at the stage of maturity,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
it is almost difficult for a new player

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
to come out, because the market

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
is ruled by large players

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
who have the effect of scale

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and the ability to develop new products.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
But the products themselves,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
that is, mobile phones,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
are very narrowly segmented.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Not just this phone

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
for business,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
but for the ordinary consumer.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
You can find 5-6 offers

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
from a communicator to a stylish business class phone.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
You can find phones

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
for ordinary consumers,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
if I can put it this way.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Some are light,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
some with a flashlight,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
with large numbers, letters.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
That is, each phone is oriented

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
to a specific segment.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It is difficult to predict

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
when the market will pass

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
the sunset of cellular communication.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It will go down,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
but with the addition of very large players,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
which will reduce the profitability,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
and the focus or segmentation

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
will decrease.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The life cycle does not always

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
look like a beautiful,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
smooth curve.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
In fact, there are several types

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
of life cycle.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
The life cycle of a newbie,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
a newbie who is unsuccessful,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
who has not lived to the stage

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
of maturity and decline,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
a rapid surge

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
and a rapid decline.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Perhaps this is due to the fact

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
that the product

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
was not competitive

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
even on the growing market.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
If you pay attention to the slide,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
you will see that even at the stage

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
of the life cycle,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
such as growth,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
products can leave the market.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
That is, the sales of

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Thompson computers

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
first went along with the market growth,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
then the company lost

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
its share and market position.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
This can be a restart

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
or a renewal

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
of the life cycle.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
In particular, on the slide you see

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
that in general the life cycle

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
of the sale of tobacco products

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
is already declining,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
but the new product of the sale

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
of the life cycle of Malboro cigarettes

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
is growing.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
If you remember,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
the life cycle is very well

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
demonstrated by the example

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
of TVs.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
In particular, black and white

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
TV receivers were growing

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and declining, but then the market

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
began to grow due to the sale

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
of colored TVs, and now

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
the market growth is due to the sale

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
of plastic TVs.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
That is, if you look

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
at specific models,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
at specific technologies,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
then their life cycle is shorter

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
than the life cycle

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
of TV receivers.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Why? Because in general

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
the TV market is at the stage

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
of growth.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
What is the advantage of the life cycle?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
First of all, it allows you to get

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
a certain dynamic vision of the market

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
and anticipate its changes,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
that is, to plan your actions in advance.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
It allows you to recognize

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
the situation and, accordingly,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
to take adequate actions

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
depending on the stage

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
of the life cycle.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
It allows you to better analyze

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
your portfolio and plan

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
the withdrawal of old goods

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
and the introduction of new ones.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
It contributes to a better understanding

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
of the markets, and therefore

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
to a better strategic analysis.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
The life cycle of goods should be

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
understood as a convenient analogy,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
not as a law imposed

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
on enterprises and their goods.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
There are quite a lot of assumptions here.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I ask you to complete the task

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
for self-checking

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
in the following order.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Task 5.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Less than one third of new goods

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
reach the buyer.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Is such a low percentage

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
in contradiction with the philosophy

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
and concept of marketing

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
to find a need and satisfy it?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Explain why.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Task 6.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
In recent studies,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
it was suggested that

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
the consumption of oatmeal,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
along with the increase

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
in the number of oatmeal products,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
reduces the level of cholesterol.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Explain what effect

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
this healing property

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
can have on the life cycle

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
of oatmeal and goods based on oats?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Task 7.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
What is the concept of assortment?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Let's look at our fourth section,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
which is titled

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Assortment Policy.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Here we will look at the concept of assortment,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
what is the characteristic of an assortment,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
the level of an assortment.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
We will try to determine the direction

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
of the assortment,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
as well as what methods

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
are used to analyze the assortment

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
and how to correctly exclude

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
low-profit or low-attractive goods.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
In particular, an assortment is a set of goods

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
that are connected to each other

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and that have the same basic functions

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
addressed to the same consumers,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
sold on the same channels of sale

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
or in the same price zones.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
An assortment is characterized

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
by three concepts

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
width and depth.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Width is the number of models

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
that the company offers.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Let's go back to the car market.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
In particular,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Renault offers 10 models of cars.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
This characterizes its range of assortment.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Smart offers only two models of assortment.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Accordingly, Smart has an assortment

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
narrower than Renault.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Depth of the assortment is

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
the number of modifications

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
of the models you offer.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
That is, how different

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
your offers are.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Depth of the assortment allows

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
to adapt the same model

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
for different price groups,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
that is, to offer more choices to consumers.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Length of the assortment is

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
a total of all modifications

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
of the models that you can

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
offer to the market.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
It is important to understand

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
that width and length of the assortment

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
have no linear dependence

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
on the volume of sales.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Pay attention to the graph.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
This is a fading curve.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Moreover, it can

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
go down at some point.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
What is it connected with?

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
With the fact that managing a large assortment

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
is quite expensive.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Expenses for managing an assortment

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
are increasing at an exceeding rate

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
to its length.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
It is important to understand

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
that there is a certain

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
conditional point of optimum

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
when it makes no sense

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
to expand your assortment.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
You should also understand

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
that the maximum profit point

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
is below the optimum point

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
in terms of sales.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And the expenses are

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
to blame for this.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Why does such a fading occur?

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
We have already talked about

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
the expenses.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
On the one hand,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
different goods are sold in different ways

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
in different volumes.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
This explains the non-linearity

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
of expansion and growth.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Secondly,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
it is important to understand

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
that goods have different seasonality.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
With a wide assortment

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
there is often an internal cannibalism

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
when goods do not increase

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
the volume of sales together.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
One plus one does not make two,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
but, for example, one point two tenths

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
or one point five tenths.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
They compete for the same

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
buyer.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
It is also important to understand

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
the benefits of specialization.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Why is it beneficial for you

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
to control the assortment

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
and not to expand it to infinity?

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
In particular,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
you see a graph on the slide.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
This is the dependence

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
on the relative productivity

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and the production assortment.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
The base point is 100% assortment

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and the production is 25-27%.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
If you reduce the assortment by half,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
the production increases by 25-27%.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
If you reduce it by half,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
the production increases by 25-27%.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
If you reduce it by half,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
the production increases by 25-27%.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
What is the reason for this?

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
It is related to the effect of experience

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
and specialization.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
The more often you perform

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
the same operation,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
the less you have to switch,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
the less you have to pay.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
The situation is shown

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
by another slide.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
It is the dependence

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
of the relative costs

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
on the production assortment.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Again,

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
if you reduce the assortment,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
the relative costs are reduced.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
If you reduce the assortment by half,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
the relative costs are reduced

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
by 20-22%.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
The relative costs are not directly

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
related to the production.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
The relative costs are not directly

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
related to the production.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
This explains why

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
the specialists

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
make the offer

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
more profitable

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
in terms of price.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
The assortment can be divided

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
into levels.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
There is the top of the assortment

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
in terms of price

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and quality.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
There is the bottom of the assortment.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
These are the cheapest goods.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
And there is the middle of the assortment.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Why do we need

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
the bottom of the assortment?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
It allows us

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
to protect ourselves

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
from price wars.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
In case of price wars,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
we have to fight against them.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This is usually

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
a minimum quality

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
for a minimum price.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
This is a segment for low-income consumers.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
The top of the assortment

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
is usually

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
what sets

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
the reputation and status of the brand.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
It is what allows

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
the company to boast of its achievements,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
to get a higher profitability,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
to sell more expensive.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
The middle of the assortment

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
was originally considered

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
as a reasonable quality

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
for a reasonable price.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
It is an optimum.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It is what formed the main income of the company.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
The world is changing.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
The middle of the assortment

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
is not considered

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
as a reasonable quality

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
for a reasonable price.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
The middle of the assortment

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
is not considered

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
as a reasonable quality

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
for a reasonable price.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
The consumer changes.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
He doesn't want a compromise.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
He wants the best

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
and the most expensive

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
or the cheapest

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
with a minimum quality.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
A few words about the features

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
First of all,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
an image is very important for the luxury goods.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
The image is a story,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
a high-quality

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
and a certain know-how.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
It is important to understand

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
that for them

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
a mass communication is not suitable.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
It is a kind of event communication

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
and a word-for-word communication.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
The distribution of the goods

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
is limited.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
They are not sold

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
in every hypermarket.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
It confirms the quality of the brand.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
The control of the sales system

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
is important.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
It is a compliance of the standards

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
of the sales of the goods

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
and a quality of the service.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
As a rule, such companies

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
use global marketing

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
because the goods of the luxury class

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
are not much different

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
depending on the region.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Let's move on to the question

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
related to the assortment analysis.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
It is important to understand

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
that the assortment analysis

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
can be carried out by the type of goods,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
by the volume of the goods,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
by the profitability

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
for us

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
using the models of the Boston Consortium.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
The ABC analysis of Dib Simkin,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
the analysis of the age of the goods

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
or on the basis of the life cycle,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
as we have already discussed.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Cannibalization.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
We need to remember

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
that we have talked about the positioning of the goods.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
The assessment of the attractiveness

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
of the goods by the consumers

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
and the use of different models,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
for example, the Fishbane model,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
which reflects the consumer behavior.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
It is important to understand

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
that certain groups are selected

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
by the type of goods.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
In particular, the leaders of the goods

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
are the goods that are sold

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
the most attractive.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
The goods of the communicators

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
or the goods of the honey

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
that are sold by the consumers

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
while buying something else.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
The goods that prepare the future,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
that is, what is being tested,

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
or opinions are formed.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Tactical goods

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
in order to win the price war

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
or replace a certain product

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
or not to allow the competition

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
to enter the segment.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
You have already said

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
in the strategic analysis

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
that the most important thing

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
is to understand

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
the characteristics of the goods

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
We have already talked

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
in the strategic marketing

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
about the matrix of the Boston Consulting Group.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
This matrix has proven

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
its effectiveness not only

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
in strategic aspects,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
but also in the analysis of the assortment.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
The only thing is

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
that this is a modified matrix.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
We use the internal information

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
of the company.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
So, along the X-axis

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
we put the volume of the product sales.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Along the Y-axis

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
we put the growth rates

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
in relation to the previous period.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
As a rule, the previous period

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
is the previous year.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
And analyzing,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
it is important

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
or you can take

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
the appropriate time intervals.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
For example,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
take 3 months of the first quarter of 2008

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
in relation to the first quarter of 2007.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Such an approach

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
allows us

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
to avoid

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
the influence of seasonality

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
on our analysis.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
So, the X-axis

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
is the volume of the product sales

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
in money,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
that is, either in rubles or dollars,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
on which your business account

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
or euro is built.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
The Y-axis is the growth rates

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
calculated by the formula

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
the volume of sales in 2008

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
divided by the volume of sales

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
for the corresponding period

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
of 2007 minus 1.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Or according to the years

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
you plan to analyze.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
In these two coordinates

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
we apply points

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
on the basis of which we can

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
make the third measurement,

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
namely, the proportion of the area of the circle.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
The area of the circle reflects

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
the marginal profitability

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
of a particular product.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
It is the marginal profitability

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
of the first order.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Let me start

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
with an example to make it clearer.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Let's imagine

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
that I am transporting a product

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
from St. Petersburg to Moscow

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
by car, Eurofor 82 cubic meters,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
20 tons.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Simultaneously

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
in this car

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
there is

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
a glass-coated insulator,

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
light but voluminous,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Italian tile,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
not very heavy,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
expensive enough,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
high-value,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and, for example, brick,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
a heavy product.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
If I distribute the cost of transportation

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
according to the cost,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
then the main cost of transportation

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
will be Italian tile

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
and it will be very expensive

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
without it.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
If I distribute it by volume,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
then practically

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
the entire cost of transportation

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
will be distributed to glass-coated insulator.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
If I distribute it

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
by weight,

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
then the brick will be

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
a non-profitable product for us.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
In fact, all three approaches

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
are correct, but

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
they give different results.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
That is,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
we can make different conclusions.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
In order to avoid

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
such variability,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
only direct variable costs

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
are used.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
That is,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
the marginal profit of the first order

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
is nothing more than the revenue

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
minus the direct variable costs.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Direct variable costs

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
are the costs

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
that disappear

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
if we stop

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
dealing with this product.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
As a rule, we can attribute

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
the cost of purchasing,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
customs duties,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
taxes related to this product,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
premium sellers for the sale of this product,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
advertising,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
if this particular product

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
or product group was advertised.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It is important to understand

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
that the warehouse

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
and the control apparatus

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
are indirect costs.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
In this case, we do not take them into account.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
So, the size of the circle

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
is proportional to the

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
marginal profit of the first order

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
for this product.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Please note that we get

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
such a spiky graph.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Accordingly, we can divide it into four squares

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
like a classic matrix.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Let's find a point on the x-axis

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
that divides the products

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
into a significant share in the portfolio

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
and a small share.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
It is quite easy to find.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
To do this, we need to divide the sales volume

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
by the number of products analyzed,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
that is, the circles on our graph.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
We will get a certain average

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
sales volume

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
for one

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
average product.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Everything that will be

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
on the left of this point

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
are products that contribute

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
a large share in the company's revenue.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Everything on the right

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
is below the average,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
that is, a small contribution to the company's revenue.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
On the y-axis,

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
we need to find a point

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
that divides the products into

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
fast-growing and slow-growing.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
We can use the average

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
sales volume of the company.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Namely, we can divide

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
the sales volume of the company

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
from 2008 to

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
the sales volume of the entire company

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
from 2007 minus one.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Accordingly, everything above

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
is fast-growing products,

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
everything below is slow-growing products.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
If we draw a line

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
from these points,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
we will get four squares.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
The upper square,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
which is characterized by high growth rates

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and a small contribution

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
to the sales volume,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
is usually new products.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yesterday one product was sold,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
today 10 products,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
the growth rate is 100%,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
but the contribution to the company's sales volume

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
is small.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
These are products

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
that are traditionally

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
loss-making for the company.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
They are loss-making

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
not in terms of the margin

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
of the first order,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
most likely they will not

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
bring a positive income,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
but in terms of the full cost,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
in terms of the promotion.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
These are products that need to be moved

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
to the side of the square,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
which is called stars.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
This square is characterized by high growth rates,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
on the one hand,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and on the other hand,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
it is characterized by a significant contribution

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
to the sales volume.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
As a rule, these are profitable products,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
attractive for the company.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
The name, accordingly, is stars.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
They grow fast, above the average

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
and bring a significant

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
sales volume.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
They are interesting,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
attractive, but as a rule,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
all this profit that the product brings

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
must be reinvested in it

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
in order to maintain growth.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
If you do not temporarily

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
withdraw flows,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
that is, stop investing

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
in replenishing the stock,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
promotion, expansion of the sales service

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
and other related processes,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
it may happen

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
that the product will go along the inclined straight,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
namely, from the star square

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
to the square

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
called the tired dog.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
This is a square that

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
contains products

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
that do not have

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
high growth rates

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and a significant contribution to sales.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The products are unprofitable and have no prospects.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
But if you support the star,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
reinvest funds in it,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
then after a while

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
saturation occurs,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
recalling the life cycle,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
and the product begins to go down into a square

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
characterized by a significant contribution

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
to the sales volume of the company,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
with a significant profit margin,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
but with low growth rates.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
This square is called

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
the tired cow.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It is necessary to reduce

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
investment budgets in this product,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
leave only at the level of

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
advertising support,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
and the money flow

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that it generates goes to financing

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
other squares.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
This is the current profit of the company.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Over time,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
the tired cow moves

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
to the square of the tired dog,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and, accordingly,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
this is a signal for you that you need to prepare

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
a restart of the product,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
prepare it for modification.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The trajectory of a disaster or an eternal failure

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
is what you should avoid.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
The trajectory of an eternal failure

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
is when the product

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
regularly goes from the square

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
of the wild cat or the question mark

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
to the square of the tired dog.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
The line constantly changes

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
between high growth rates and low growth rates,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
but it does not take a significant share

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
in the sales volume of the company.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
As a rule, such products are subject to reduction.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
These are unsuccessful products.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Let's take a closer look at the situation

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
in the square of the tired dog.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
In a good way,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
we should part with these products,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
exclude them from our range.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
They have no prospects,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
but they do not make a significant contribution

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
to the sales volume of the company.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
But when we reduce the range,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
we should remember four important points.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
First, these may seem to be niche products,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
which traditionally cannot compete

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
in sales volume

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
with the sales of other products of the company.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
For example,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
if we own a store of office goods

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and sell Chinese pens,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the cost of which is 5 rubles,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and Parker Waterman pens,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
the cost of which is 50 rubles,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
the cost of which is tens of hundreds of times more,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
in order to get a comparable profit

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
from the sale of one Parker pen,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
we need to sell 3-4 packages of Chinese pens.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But they will never be sold

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
in the same volumes as cheap pens.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
The second point you should remember

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
is that by removing the product

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
from the range,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
you should reduce

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
the constant and indirect costs

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
in order not to reduce

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
the profit of the company

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
or introduce new products

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
that have prospects

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
and will take over

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
some of the constant and indirect costs of the company.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Otherwise,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
you will reduce the real profit of the company,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
which should not be allowed.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
The third point.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
These may be products of mutual demand,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
and, accordingly,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
the reduction of their range

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
will lead to a much greater

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
sales volume

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
than the sales volume of these products.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Let me illustrate with an example.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
There is a grocery store.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
There is milk and muesli.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Milk is a classic tired dog.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
No income, no revenue.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
The store usually does not get money from it.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And the product,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
the consumption of which

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
does not grow significantly.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Muesli, in the background of a healthy lifestyle,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
is a fast-growing product.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And, secondly,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
it is a high-profit product.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
But if the store reduces the sale of milk,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
then the sale of muesli

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
will also decrease.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
We will not buy muesli in one store,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and not milk in the other.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
We will go where both of these products are sold.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Such products are often called

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
complementary.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And the third point.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
You will have to keep products

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
that somehow reflect

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the position of your company,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
historically connected.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
For example, AXEROX will never be able

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
to refuse to produce copies.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Sony will refuse to produce

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
household appliances.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
These are the products

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
that are historically connected with these brands.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And as soon as the refusal is over,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
it will be another company.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It will not be AXEROX.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It will not be Sony.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
The second matrix that allows us to evaluate

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
the product portfolio

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
is the IBC analysis of Diba Simkin.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It is important to understand

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
that one matrix is not enough

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
for adequate conclusions.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You should, as a rule, use at least two analyses

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
that allow you to look at the range

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
at different angles.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
In particular, the Diba Simkin matrix

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
allows you to analyze the portfolio

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
in two components.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
The volume of sales and the contribution of the coverage of costs.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But instead of the contribution of the coverage of costs,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I think it is worth

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
using

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
such an indicator as

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the profitability of the product.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
The profitability of the product

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
is the revenue minus the direct variable costs

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
divided by the revenue.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That is, it is the percentage that reflects

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
the share of the marginal profit of the first order

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
in the revenue per product.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
The volume of sales

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
is also measured in money.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
The A matrix is 20%

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
of the number of

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
the best products,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
which is transferred to 80% of the revenue of the company.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
We allocate them.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Accordingly,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
based on the allocation

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
of this square

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
we get

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
B1, B2 and C.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
In the A matrix

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
there is no need to make changes.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It is your gold fund

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
that transfers the revenue

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and the profit to the company.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
The B1 matrix

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
is the products that

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
sell well,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
but bring a little profit to the company.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The strategy is

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
to look for ways to reduce the costs

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
in order to

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
bring the A matrix as close as possible.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
The B2 matrix

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
is the products that

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
have a good profitability

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
for the company,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
but are still selling poorly.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Accordingly, do not be greedy.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Invest part of the potential profit

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
in promotion

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
so that the products from the B2 matrix

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
can get closer or move to the A matrix.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The products of the C matrix

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
should be considered

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
for reduction,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
but taking into account the four points

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
that we talked about earlier.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The graph on the slide

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
demonstrates

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
the essence of the analysis.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
The small number of

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
products of the group

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
brings the most revenue.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The principle of Pareto is 20 to 80.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
You probably have already heard about it.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
The expert assessment of the assortment

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
without extra math

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
allows you to

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
evaluate your assortment.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
In particular,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
it is important to understand

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
that the product should be convenient

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
for all the companies.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
The supply should be

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
cheap enough

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and effective.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
The product should sell well

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
If there is a failure

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
on some plot,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
the product is not attractive.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
As a rule, this product has no significant prospects

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
in terms of its market success.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
In order to conduct an analysis,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
you need to first of all

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
deal with the goals of the company.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
What is a priority for you?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
What is the strategy?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
In accordance with this strategy,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
each unit involved in the analysis

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and this unit,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
in one way or another,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
the additional cost of the product

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
is given.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It depends on the goals.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
If the task is to increase

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
the volume of revenue now,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
the sales department will get the most.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
If it is necessary

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
to assess the potential

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
sales of goods,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
that is, the future prospects of the company,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
the marketing department will get the most.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
If the task is to maximize the profit of the company,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
then, of course, the best view of the profit

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
or the most adequate

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
will be provided by the financial service.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
The supply department will assess

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
the availability of resources,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that is, what you can save.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
If you have your own production,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
then, accordingly, you need to include

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
the production unit.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
On a ten-point scale,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
each product is assessed

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
according to the specified criteria.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
For example, the marketing department

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
has a perspective, the sales department

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
has a simple sales or attractiveness

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
for customers at the moment,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
the product profitability department,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
the supply department has a perspective

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
on the availability of resources,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
the possibility of cheap delivery.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Accordingly, the product

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
that received the highest average rating,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
which is like the sum of the products,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
the weight on the assessment

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
of this particular product,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
accordingly,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
it must be promoted

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
to the market

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
and the possibility

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
of excluding goods

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
that received a low rating,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
that is,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
they have no prospect from the company's point of view.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Dmitry Borovinsky's analysis

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
allows you to develop

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
a system of ratings

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
or explain the demand

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
from the client.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
What does Borovinsky say?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
That you need to make a brainstorm

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and set independent

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
criteria for each other,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
that is, such as the volume of advertising,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
the advantage in price,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
the packaging, for example.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
There can be quite a lot of them.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Each criterion gets its weight

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
from the point of view of the client,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
that is, what is more important for the client.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Next, according to each of the criteria,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
we evaluate the goods,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
but in this case we should analyze

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
the goods that are homogeneous

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
from our assortment

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and from the assortment of competitors.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Accordingly, we also find the product rating,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
that is,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
the amount of products,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
the weight of the product,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
the criterion for the evaluation of a particular product.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
What is the logic?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
In this case,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
the logic is that the higher the product rating,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
the higher the volume of sales.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
If this is not the case,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
that is, the correlation coefficient

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
of the rows of ratings

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and the volume of sales

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
does not tend to one,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
then we are somewhere wrong.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Where? In the ratings?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Hardly.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Most likely, we were wrong

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
in the client's view of the product attractiveness.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And you need to choose the weights

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
in such a way

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
that the correlation coefficient

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
of the rating or the evaluation of the goods

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and the volume of sales

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
tends to one.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
What do we get in the end?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
We get the importance

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
of those or other criteria for the client

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
when choosing a product.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
On the other hand, we get, in principle,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
a prediction of the volume of sales

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
of non-existing or not yet

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
released goods on the market.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Namely, we can add product 4,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
product 5, product 6,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
drive along this matrix.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And if the rating will lie

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
between 3 and 4, 3 and 8,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
as in this example,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
then I dare to assume

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
that the volume of sales

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
will lie between 987 and 1597.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
A more interesting possibility

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
for use

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
or analogy of this analysis

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
is the multiplicity regression.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The Fishbein model also allows us

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
to evaluate the attractiveness of a product

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
or its competitiveness.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
This model is based on

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
the compensatory principle

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
of choosing a product.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
That is, when a client chooses a product

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
based on the sum of criteria

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
depending on the importance

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
of a particular criteria for him.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
But Fishbein has introduced

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
a rather interesting point.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
He says that

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
the importance of a particular criteria

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
is not always the one

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
that the client calls

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
and there is a place to be

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
in the choice of this product.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Fishbein says that it is necessary

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
to increase the importance

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
of those parameters

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
by which goods have the greatest difference

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
and vice versa to reduce the importance

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
of those criteria

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
by which goods differ insignificantly.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Let's illustrate this on an example.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
If I ask you

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
what is important for you

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
in terms of the bank

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
in which you will take a mortgage loan,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
you will most likely name

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
the interest rate on this loan,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
the probability of withdrawing the loan,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and possibly

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
service maintenance.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And let's say the fourth

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and very insignificant parameter

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
is the distance

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
from your new place of residence

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
to the bank branch.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
We do not give this

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
much importance yet,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
although we have 15 years left

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and we will have to pay

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
certain payments

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
every month

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
in the account of the loan.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
if we look at the market

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
from the client's point of view,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
it will turn out that the interest rates

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
in many banks are the same

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and differ insignificantly.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
The probability of withdrawing a loan

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
is also unified.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
The level of service

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
is not the most client-oriented organization

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
and, again,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
it is at the same low level.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
So,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
this is not the decisive factor for us.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
The decisive factor

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
is that small

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and insignificant parameter

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
in which banks

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
differ principally

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
in terms of the distance

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
from your new place of residence.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
This is the basic logic

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
that allows us to consider the Fishbein model.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Let's look at the question

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
of determining the interrelated demand.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
How to determine

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
if you have complementary goods,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
goods whose sales volume

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
is interrelated to each other?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Remember the example

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I gave about milk and muesli.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
How to determine?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
In fact,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
mathematical methods

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
for determining the interrelated demand

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
are necessary.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
You need to build a matrix

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
where columns are the names of individual goods,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and lines are the individual checks,

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
if it is a retail store,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
or the invoice account

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
that you issued to the client,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
invoice account,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
or requests.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Why?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Because the loading documents usually reflect

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
what you had in the warehouse

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and you were able to unload.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And not what the client asked.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
In the cross-sections of the goods' accounts,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
we mark either 0

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
or 1,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
that is,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
binary logic.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
0 if the goods are not present

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
in this account,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
1 if the goods are present.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Accordingly,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
if I need to see

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
whether the demand of goods 1

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and goods 2

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
is interrelated,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I just need to calculate

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the correlation between

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
column 1 and column 2.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
If the correlation coefficient

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
is more than 0.68,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
then the correlation is already

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
considered significant,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
and you need to pay special attention

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
to these goods

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
to figure out

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
which of them is the branch,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
and which is the leading one.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Often people ask

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
whether it is possible

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
to have a goods

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
in the characteristics of the matrix

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
of the Boston Consulting Group

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
or a goods

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
that is at the end

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
of its life cycle,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
revive it,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
turn it into a star

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
or provide it with rapid growth.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Igor Yantsev,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
an American of Russian origin,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
offers us 4 ways.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
The first way is

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
to stay on the existing market

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
for existing clients.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Or to easily modify the product.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
The second way

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
is to come out

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
with a new product

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
for existing clients.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
The third way

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
is to bring

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
the existing product

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
to the new market,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
not necessarily the regional one,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
meaning the market from the point of view

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
of consumers.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
If

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
for example

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
we stick

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
a special glue

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
on the walls

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
of the book,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
it can come out

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
with the same glue

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
to the new market,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
where the glue

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
should stay on the surface

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
where we stick it,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
but not on the surface

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
where we stick it.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
In particular,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
such glue is used

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
in the construction business.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
The painting tape

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
is designed

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
on the basis

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
of this glue.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
The fourth way

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
is to bring

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
a new product to the new market.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It is diversification.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Of course,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
the risks associated with such actions

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
are different.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Yantsev's way means

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
that the modification of the product

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
is 50-50.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Even the change of the packaging

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
may lead to the reduction of the volume

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
of the product.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
On the other hand,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
the possibility of success

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
is only 20%.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Why?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Because the new market

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
means new conditions.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
In marketing,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
it is considered

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
extremely important

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
to know the consumer.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Such knowledge appears

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
only in the process of experience

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
of interaction with the client.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
The probability of bringing

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
new products to existing clients

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
is estimated at 30%.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
The probability of success

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
in diversification

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
is 5%,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
or even less.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Why? Because you enter

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
a new market and a new product.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But in the next graph

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
the higher the risk,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
the higher the potential

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
profit and revenue of the company.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Accordingly,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
you should plan your portfolio

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
not only in terms of potential

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
sales volume,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
but also in terms of the risks

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
associated with these actions.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
The Matrix of McKinsey General Electric

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
can also be used

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
when analyzing the assortment.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
This matrix differs from the matrix

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
of the Boston Consulting Group

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
If the matrix of the Boston Consulting Group

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
is absolutely objective,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
it is numbers,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
which are difficult to play with,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
not taking into account

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
a number of high-quality parameters,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
the Matrix of McKinsey General Electric

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
allows you to do this.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
We evaluate in two axes

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
the market attractiveness of the product

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
for us and for the company,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
how convenient it is to produce it,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
what is the profitability

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
of this product,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
potential growth,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
and so on.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
For us, as for investors,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
on the other hand,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
the strong sides,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
namely the client's opinion

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
of how competitive we are in this market.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Accordingly, we can determine

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
based on a criteria analysis

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
two coordinates,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
attractiveness for us

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
and strong sides or competitiveness of the product.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Depending on the position

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
in two axes,

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
we can determine

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
how much money

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
this product has.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The quadrant is a significant market attractiveness

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
and significant strong sides for the business.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Accordingly, these are the products

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
in which we should invest the maximum

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
of funds and efforts.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
It is in this quadrant

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
that everything is

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
will bring us a significant success.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
The other extreme

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
is a minor attractiveness

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
and minor strong sides

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
We get profit from this product

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
while it is there,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
we get rid of it as soon as the product becomes

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
unprofitable.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
The intermediate action is the selective growth.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
For example, we invest in a product

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
only in those segments

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
where it is the strongest

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
or has growth prospects,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
or in those markets

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
where it makes sense.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But we do not make

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
mass investments,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
they should be accurate.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Or we get profit

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and refuse to invest

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
until the product brings profit.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Let's imagine

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
that you have conducted an analysis

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
of your product portfolio

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
and you are not satisfied.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
What conclusions should be drawn from this?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
First of all,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
these actions should be regular.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
If you are engaged in cellular communication,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
where the life cycle

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
of one phone model

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
is about 3-6 months,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
then you should conduct

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
a full-scale assortment analysis

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
once a quarter.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
If you work in markets

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
associated with minor changes,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
for example,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
the raw material market,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
then it is possible that the analysis

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
should be conducted once every 5 years.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
For most companies, the next time cycle is suitable.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Namely, once every six months

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
we conduct an intermediate assessment analysis,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
that is, whether we are going the right way,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
whether we have made a mistake,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
whether we are on the right path of product movement.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And once a year we conduct a thorough assessment

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
of the work per year,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
as well as the planning of the portfolio

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
for the next year.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
If you are not satisfied with the product portfolio,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
then it is important for you to realize

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
the following point,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
that you should treat the implementation of changes

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
as a project,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
for which funds, people and time are allocated.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Otherwise,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
no matter how much you solve the problem,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
it can only be aggravated.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
This problem is obvious

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
on the matrix of the Boston Consulting Group.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Let's recall it.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Stars are your profit tomorrow,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
a milk cow is your profit today,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
wild cats or question marks

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
are your profit the day after tomorrow.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
That is, a kind of life cycle

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
folded in half.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And if a company

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
does not have star products,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
it means that after some time

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
it will experience problems with profitability,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
and already now it experiences problems

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
with the pace of sales growth.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Because a large number of products

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
in the matrix of the question mark

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
or wild cats

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
creates additional load

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
on the company's profit,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
but often does not become

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
star products.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Accordingly,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
the product portfolio

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
should be weighted,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
the product portfolio

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
should be full,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
but any changes

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
should be taken as a very serious project.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
The next point

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
that you need to remember

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
is that even the best goods

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
need to be promoted.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
You need to give time

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
to the diffusion of the product

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
on the market,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
and on the other hand

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
to leave some of the investment

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
for the start of the project

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
on the market,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
for the advertising campaign

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
of a new product.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
In this case,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
you will be able to get a premium profit,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
and the product will be easier

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
to enter the market.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
But study the foreign experience

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
of innovation
