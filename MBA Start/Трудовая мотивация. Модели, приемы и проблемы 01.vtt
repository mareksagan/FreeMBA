WEBVTT

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.160
Good morning, dear colleagues.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.460
My name is Oleg Yevgenievich of Baksan.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.820
I am a professor of the Russian

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.100
Academy of Economics named after

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.160
Georgy Valentinovich Plekhanov, where

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.580
I read various MBA courses devoted

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.900
to human resources management, management

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.240
of the organization.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.240
I am also a practicing consultant

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.600
in the field of human resource

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.920
management.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.660
The theme of today’s meeting is the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.920
analysis of labor motivation, those models

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500
that exist in motivation, those

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.460
techniques of change, modification,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.760
improvement of motivation.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.560
And, of course, when we talk

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.800
about motivation, we will

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.340
stop at the main problems

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.440
that arise in this

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.400
system.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.480
If we go to the problems of motivation,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.260
then this problem, one could say,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.240
is as old as the world.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.020
What is motivation?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.600
If not to get into the various academic

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.100
theories, the disputes which,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.280
in principle, we are not interested,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.600
because the challenge that is before

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.380
us is to master those practical

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.980
skills that will be of interest

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.080
to us from the point of view

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.680
of our functioning in business,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.240
from the point of view of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.660
solving those business

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.720
challenges that are before us.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.660
Therefore, from the point

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.720
of view of pragmatic assessment,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.840
pragmatic understanding

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
of motivation, it represents

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.000
the reasons that determine

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.140
human behavior.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.020
Why does a man make an

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.300
effort to work?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.460
Why does he work with an enthusiast,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.500
or does he work with a coolant?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
Why does a person

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.920
sit late at work to get the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.060
same results, regardless

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240
of whether he will receive

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.520
an additional reward

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.700
for this, or not?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.260
And why a person, even seemingly,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.360
occupying a certain status position,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.820
having a good enough fork, and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.180
work does not cause him to rise,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.960
does not cause him to interest,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.920
he is sitting down, serves his

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.780
deadlines, how the attitude of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.440
a person to work, how this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.040
attitude passes, because we

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400
all know that our motivation does

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.280
not remain constant, if we

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.820
face some interesting thing, with

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.940
some interesting problem,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.240
then we are interested in

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.720
them, we try to find different

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.680
ways, ways of approach,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.780
to get new knowledge to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.300
solve the tasks that are

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.680
before us, and we seek results.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.840
As we these results, our

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.840
interest continues to fall.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.180
We already know how to solve it.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.420
It is turning for us from new to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.360
routine, to usual, to usual, and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.420
we already know what and how to do.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.720
We know what difficulties

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.460
will arise when there will be problems

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.280
with reports, and so on.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.140
And from this rise of the original,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.560
with which we dealt with this

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.180
problem, we are already moving

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.840
to a calm, or excluded, time-driven.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.620
The other side of the problem.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.600
We solve a task.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.740
For example, we are aiming to increase

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.820
our sales plans within a month

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.340
by 10-15%.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.140
We solve this task, actively solve

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.260
it, but bonuses are promised for it.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.260
We were hinted that if we

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.800
deal with this task, we will get

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.220
some career prospects, and we

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.420
will devote all our strength,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.120
all our efforts to solve

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.280
the problems we face, fine

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.040
opportunities, try to harm

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.380
new schemes, new models, well

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.680
or it works.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.880
We do not have a steady growth

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880
in sales, and accordingly

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.700
we begin to understand that we

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.900
will not be able to the result

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.660
at the end of the month, and

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.640
again our motivation

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.840
is falling.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.120
Only in this case it falls not because

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.000
we have decided on the task and accordingly

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.340
we already know how and what to do,

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.300
it falls precisely because we

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.220
have lowered our hands.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.480
We realized that we will not

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.360
solve the task.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.700
We convinced ourselves that it was

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.440
mid-month today, and I have a sales

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.280
growth of only three percent.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.720
And so, we have been scheduled

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.700
in our own defeat, so we lose the motive,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.980
we lose the cause of behavior, we

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.140
have decided for ourselves,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.040
we will not cope with the task.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.340
And so we are also starting

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.100
to work again, already realizing that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.060
at the end of the month we will

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.700
have to report why the task

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.860
is not solved.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.500
It is also a problem of motivation.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.820
How to such a situation?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.640
Such a situation that a person is

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.120
not afraid to make a mistake,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.600
that a person understands that

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.240
if he solves a new task, it does

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.520
not mean that he will necessarily

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.160
get it right away.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.240
Here there are old problems of the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.100
ratio of my responsibility, the delegation

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.340
of responsibility to me, the problem

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.800
of counting the results obtained.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.060
The problem of finding the balance between

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.980
freedom and dependence.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.740
Freedom to delegate any other powers.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.580
This is all that large, colossal

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.300
topic that is related to the issues

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.660
of motivation.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.380
And accordingly, this is the

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.900
topic that arises before us

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.460
every day during our business work.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.280
We can motivate ourselves, we want

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.460
to go to work, we want to develop,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.000
we don’t want to develop in terms

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.660
of the development of the company,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.400
the development of business.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.060
We are obliged to motivate

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.480
employees if we are the managers

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.580
of the business owner, because

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.720
it is the employees that are

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.080
the tool, the way in which

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.320
we get the desired results

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.640
for us, but here it is very

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.560
important to understand that

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.080
people, staff, colleagues should

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.740
not be seen as a means

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.240
to their goals.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.440
People feel this very well,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.620
and it is a huge

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.820
demotory factor.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.580
The problem of human resource management

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.780
in terms of building a

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.960
motivation system is also a very

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.060
interesting problem, which

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.900
we will pay a lot of attention

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.400
to today.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.180
Well, of course, the basic term

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.220
that interests us is what

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.740
is work motivation?

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.080
Motivation is a general concept

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.560
associated with the search for causes

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.260
of human behavior.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.540
But when we talk about commerce, about

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.680
business, we are not interested

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.860
in human behavior at all.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.820
This is an interesting academic

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.680
topic that scientists can engage

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.360
in, but we are interested in

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.020
the specific reason for the

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.020
behavior of a person in

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.940
the implementation of his work

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.320
activity, his functional duties

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.740
that are related to the

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.520
work that Auna performs, the

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.320
work for which he

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.040
is rewarded, and the work

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.200
that in principle interests us,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.840
the work that we organize.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.320
Again, we will not give different arguments

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.200
in different nuances and subtleties,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.080
the concepts of labor motivation, because

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.800
If we look at literature, if we look

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.020
at basic fundamental textbooks,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.620
then accordingly we will

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.780
find different reviews and

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.520
different definitions in them.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.700
But since we are further

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.500
interested in the practical

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.940
definition, the definition

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.780
that we can use in practice,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.320
let us under labor motivation

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.020
Under any circumstances,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.940
during our course, understand

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.740
the process of stimulating,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.580
first, a single executor, one

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.040
employee, or the entire

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.640
labor team.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.780
Moreover, this stimulation

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.860
process is aimed at achieving

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.260
the specific goals that are

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.380
faced by the organization, first,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.660
at achieving these goals, and

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.340
secondly, productive implementation

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.940
of the decisions made and

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.880
planned plans.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.620
This is a general definition

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.800
that includes an individual employee,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.360
an entire organization with

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.600
all its characteristics, with

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.280
all its features, with its

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.320
psychological climate, and which

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.540
necessarily includes the

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.980
end result.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.960
When we talk about business,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.520
we are primarily interested in

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.340
the final result.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.300
We invest money and ultimately we

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.300
want to get a return.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.680
Therefore, we need the final

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.760
result in terms of making certain decisions,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.220
their achievement, but also

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.260
in terms of realizing the goals,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.280
missions, tasks, organization

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.100
of the firm in the company

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.260
in which we work.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.320
These are the aspects that are

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.120
considered, evaluated,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.120
studied in different

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.040
approaches to motivation.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.860
Even if we talk about motivation,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.660
motivation is always related to needs.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.640
As for needs, again, here it

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.880
should be remembered that business

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.240
needs are understood slightly

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.180
differently than in psychology

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.040
or academic environments.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.400
In psychology, well, in life in general,

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.440
a need is a need of a person for something.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.260
Man lacks something.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.540
He wants to eat, drink,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.900
rest, walk, enjoy.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.100
And, accordingly, it

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.920
makes efforts to meet

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.740
these needs.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.340
As for business, of course there

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.880
is a need for something here too,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.900
but this is already a specific

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.580
need, a need to and receive

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.260
profit, a need to establish

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.800
contractual relations with employees,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.760
contractual relations with

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.160
partners, with those people

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.420
who are bound to us, with whom

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.600
we have common rules and

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.120
principles of work.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.540
There are two types

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.060
of needs: primary

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.200
and secondary.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.660
The primary needs are those

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.480
that are necessary for

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.080
a person to be able

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080
to work.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.600
In order for a man to work,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.860
he must be full.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.340
Because if you sit at work

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.040
hungry, you will think first

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.600
of all not about doing

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.340
the job, but about just

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.060
filling your hunger.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.900
If you sit at work, for example, as

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.420
it is usually in the summer, it is very

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.140
hot outside, and there is no

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.060
air conditioning in the room, then,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.680
accordingly, you are not thinking

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.500
about working, but you are thinking

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.720
about what to breathe.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.180
You think about where you would

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.740
drink the same cold water.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.080
You think that all the windows are on the

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.640
doorstep, and still it is impossible to work.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.820
Therefore, the primary needs are essentially

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.040
the creation of the conditions

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.680
necessary for work.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.500
It is the satisfaction of

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.860
the same physiological needs.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.200
In order for a person to start solving

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.800
business tasks, those necessary

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.940
start needs must only be met

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.340
after the satisfaction of the

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.440
saturation of which he can start

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.440
thinking about something else.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.300
The other is secondary needs.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.080
Secondary needs are created in the

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.280
course of life, in the process

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.660
of acquiring experience, in the

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.460
process of acquiring knowledge.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.180
And, accordingly, secondary

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.680
needs are the needs in achieving

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.940
goals, in obtaining a certain

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.140
status, in career

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.100
growth, in material

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.300
growth, in promotion,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.920
in getting into the staff

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.300
and so on.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.840
Only after the primary

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.180
needs are met can

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.400
we talk about secondary needs.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.280
There are no miracles.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.260
And if we want to get some result

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.500
immediately, you first reach those

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.020
or other indicators,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.340
but then we will already think

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.580
about how to meet your initial

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.120
requirements.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.940
This situation will not be resolved.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.760
A person will never think about

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.220
business results until he has

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.760
thought about satisfying his

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.540
desires, his interests, his

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.240
goals.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.120
In principle, when we talk about

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.360
labor motivation, we can not give

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.640
in other terms, in other concepts.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.640
We will be as necessary when

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.480
we consider different models,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.720
when we study different ways of

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.140
material motivation, intangible

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.900
motivation, introduce additional

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.400
related concepts, but the

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.880
basic concepts are precisely

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.360
the concepts of labor motivation,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.580
primary and secondary needs.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.000
As for the different concepts

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.800
and theories of motivation,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.480
we will focus on three

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.300
basic concepts, simply because

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.220
these concepts are really basic.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.840
If we consider a large number

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.080
of different motivation

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.560
theories, then it turns out, all

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.180
of them can be grouped in three

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.920
main directions.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.280
Let us be more precise.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.800
The truss directions are practically

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.200
significant, because, naturally, if

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.100
we consider theories, there are completely

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.340
different criteria for their applicability

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.620
and their justification.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.260
The first theory of needs and,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.640
accordingly, the construction

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.180
of motivation is the hierarchical

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.640
theory of needs.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.920
Proposed to Abraham Masla, the

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.780
first works appeared somewhere

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.860
in 1943.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.860
I want to draw attention immediately.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200
The concepts we are considering

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.280
are still dating back to

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.260
the middle of the last century.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.360
But this does not mean that these

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.860
are already some good dust

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.120
theories, which it is time to file.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.500
The concepts we are going

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.500
to talk about now are really

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.580
the basic theories on which

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.500
all modern ideas are based.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.140
Ideas of self-learning organizations, ideas

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.320
of learning organizations, ideas of system

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.760
organizations, ideas of structural

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.160
organizations.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.240
The ideas of virtual organizations.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.640
All those new fashion trends

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.420
that you will naturally

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.700
get acquainted with during our

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.640
course are still based on three

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.120
basic concepts.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.540
And, accordingly, it is not

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.080
necessary to consider that since these

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.240
are concepts of the last century,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.420
and also its midst, they are

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.240
of no more than academic interest.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.120
These are the concepts that

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.820
really work and which over the

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.640
past half century have proven their

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.200
pragmatic significance.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.160
We are interested in pragmatism.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.980
We are practicing with you, we

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.120
are not doing academic research.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.520
We are not writing a dissertation, we

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.720
are concerned with our business, our tasks.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.220
As for the theory of hierarchical

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.160
needs of oil, it is a very large

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.700
volume theory, where there

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.620
are many different nuances,

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.880
but we will be interested

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.100
in the following aspects.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.920
Oil identifies so-called

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.620
basic needs and metabehoves.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.540
In fact, in part we have already talked

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.540
about this, primary and

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.460
secondary needs.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.460
So this definition, which we have

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.020
considered from the

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.940
beginning, actually goes back

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.520
to oil.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.500
Oil just said that there are

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.220
basic or vital needs – these

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.900
are the needs to provide

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.180
our lives – food, food, reproduction,

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.720
clothing, housing.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.760
That is, these are the needs

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.680
that provide the comfort of

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.420
our existence.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.820
Until basic needs

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.360
are met, no other

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.440
needs will be met.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.020


00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.780
The first thing a person does, what

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.700
he does necessarily, what he does

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.680
in any circumstances, what

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.600
he always does, is to satisfy

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.600
his basic needs.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.300
It is normal.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.340
This is biologically normal

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.480
because basic needs

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.240
ensure our physical survival.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.520
If we do not satisfy at least

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.960
one basic need, we will be

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.320
threatened by our lives

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.300
and naturally about anything

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.660
else we will simply think of not

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.980
being able to save the basic

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.220
needs that constitute the foundation

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.440
of human existence, the

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.160
fundamental cause of

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.320
human behavior, there are derived

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.180
needs, those needs that oilfully

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.840
calls meta-needs, these

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.340
are the needs of justice,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.060
well-being, social

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.660
order, need for respect,

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.380
need for recognition.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.920


00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.120
In fact, the Maslow pyramid

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.960
you are naturally familiar

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.680
with represents this structure

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.500
of needs, from basic

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.740
to metabehand.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.940
The main idea that Maslow

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.180
has laid out is that

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.320
this need, this need

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.140
pyramid, is a system,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.560
and no need above can

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.040
be attained until

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.260
it is satisfied

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.620
by the need below.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.100
Human motivation does not

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.420
allow for runs.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.740
In this sense, one can

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.800
be forced to work for free.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.580
But this requires threat, force,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.380
camps, wire, and so on.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.460
This is all that we have

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.720
seen in our own history,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.240
in the Gulag, and so

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:43.880
on.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.220
Yes, people worked there for free,

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.020
but not because they had the

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.600
appropriate motivation, they had

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.180
fear, and in fact this work was

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.300
related to the fact that in

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.200
this way, driven into such conditions,

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.080
they satisfied their

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.580
basic needs.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.920
There was no metaphoric need.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.260


00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.620
Since, naturally, the concept

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.220
of oil seemed to be a civilized

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.940
foreign western business, it was

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.480
again applied to people in the

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.620
situation where there

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.740
was an approach of external

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.040
pressure that applies to people.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.900
Oil in its concept considered

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.920
the different varieties of

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.720
these needs.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.520
Deficiency needs and

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.340
meteoric needs.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.140
But since it is not his theory itself

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.660
that is important to us now, but

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.840
those ideas that have found their

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.220
expression, we can, for now,

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.780
stop at basic and metaphorizes

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.780
in terms of understanding systemicity

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.620
and in terms of understanding what.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.600
And this is a very important principle,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.900
and this is why I am calling

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.660
your attention to it again and again,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.580
that each of the above needs

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.260
can only be attained after

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.200
the previous one has been attained.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.880
And what is very important, that

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.260
he paid attention to Maslow,

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.940
and not only paid attention,

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.680
but actually proved it, and

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.180
then subsequently received

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.640
a huge number of confirmations.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.960
Once you have built your pyramid

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.180
of needs, it doesn’t mean it

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.540
will remain unchanged

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.440
for a lifetime.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.320
People are living beings.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.740
Their needs, goals, goals, emotions,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.960
motives change.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.180
And once a pyramid built can break

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.480
down because external conditions

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.560
change in it, and these conditions

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.800
change non-resilient needs,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.280
including basic ones.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.340
Let’s say, you moved the middle

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.200
lane to Zapolyaria, and here

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.100
to meet your needs in warmth, in

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.280
food will be quite different conditions,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.940
different ways to them.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.480
Therefore, until you learn to

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.120
trust your basic needs systematically,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.180
you will not think about

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.040
meta-needs, about metamotives

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.620
associated with achieving

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.440
certain business results.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.740
This pyramid of needs changes

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.080
throughout a person’s life.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.880
It is not a static structure,

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.520
it is a dynamic formation

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.480
that is constantlyined,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.880
is in constant motion,

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.380
and is not once and

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.000
for all given.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.180
This is also a very important

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.600
idea, which essentially answers

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.920
the question why once built

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.980
a motivation system in the company,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.320
which in my company proved its effectiveness,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.300
which contributed to the growth

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.340
of my company, its expansion,

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.500
the provision of new

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.500
services, development

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.540
and expansion of production.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.860
Why did it suddenly fail

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.280
after 5, 6, 10, 15 years

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.600
of application?

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.880
In 10 years it has proven its effectiveness,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.740
I don’t want everything to go

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.200
wrong.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.840
What happened?

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.200
The circumstances have changed,

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.300
the people who work in the company have

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.340
changed, their motives, their

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.540
desires, their stands, and their needs

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.880
have changed.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.660
And this whole system is out of control

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.980
and requires modification.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.180
Don’t be afraid to change

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.380
the needs that exist.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.720
Unification of needs

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.900
is possible only after the

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.180
end of life.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.480
As long as we are alive, our needs change.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.520
The following concept of motivation,

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.300
again, which has a significant

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.880
impact on the understanding,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.500
vision, development of the tasks

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.120
that face the business.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.800
This is the so-called two-factor theory

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.760
of motivation of Hersberg.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.940
You can meet him with different

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.060
writing, Hersberg, Hersberg.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.420
It is just a slide with his English surname.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.000
As you can see,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.020
it is the same person.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.580
The basic ideas of this concept were

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.520
formed in the 50s of the last century,

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.120
and again, as far as Geisberg was

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.040
concerned, he largely pushed away

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.400
from the representation of ideas

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.980
that were given by the oil, because

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.480
the concept of the oil was

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.540
given almost 10 years earlier.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.560
And we can say that the ideas of

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.780
Oil quickly gained popularity, and,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.580
of course, Gersberg already

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.460
came from them.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.000
Is there a concept of oil?

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.560
This was still to a greater extent

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.900
a psychological concept, because

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.740
Ole was still a psychologist

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.520
and, accordingly, he

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.840
was interested in the study of humans,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.740
then Gersberg was directly

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.280
involved in the study and analysis

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.420
of labor motivation, studied

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.820
by analyzing what motives

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.960
drive human work, what motives

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.880
contribute to the achievement

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.880
of results by a person

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.060
and how to strive for the

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.480
motivation of labor not

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.300
to fall, but to increase

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.140
constantly.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.520
Herzberg proposes two types of factors.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.720
It emphasizes not so much on

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.180
human needs, but on basic

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.880
and metaphor needs.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.680
It is not pushed back by the person, but

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.580
by the production, by the business,

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.200
by the place where the person works.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.980
Heisberg identifies internal

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.780
factors that represent the content

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.020
of the work, what a person

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.000
does, whether he produces

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.620
something, provides

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.160
services, supports the

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.260
production.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.840
And from the point of view of Geisberg,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.820
it is precisely internal factors, that

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.020
is, my assessment, my experiences,

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.240
my approach, my needs - it is what

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.660
increases the satisfaction of a

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.660
person with work, the work that

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.400
a person is engaged in.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.380
It is the person from within,

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.800
it is my inner content,

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.100
my psychic features, my

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.780
subjective worldview – it

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.560
is something that either gives

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.000
me satisfaction or does

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.360
not deliver, or the work

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.080
I do, no matter why, I like

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.240
it, and I want to go to work

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.900
with pleasure, I am ready

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.180
to work to delay, I am ready

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.140
to solve the tasks that

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.180
arise before me, I

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.480
am satisfied with this work,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.180
or I do the necessary duty

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.120
to live, I need money,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.760
to have money, I must

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.340
be at work.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.400
Here I came to work and was forced

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.140
to spend my time, from 9 to 6, with

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.060
a lunch break and smoking.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.380
I am not satisfied with my work and

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.780
I am fulfilling my duty.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.480
That’s the way I’

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.720
m present now to

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.880
get money.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.760
I am not satisfied

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.880
with the amount of

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.500
money I get.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.840
I have no inner

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.740
satisfaction.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.180
That is, the internal factors

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.240
that I have present, they lead

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.820
to negative motivation.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.350
Moreover, it is the internal

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.050
factors from the point of view

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.070
of Helsberg that are leading

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.630
and main in terms of job satisfaction

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.810
and in terms of achieving

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.010
the results I want to get.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.050
And in addition to these internal

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.290
factors, what concerns these

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.030
internal factors is in fact

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.850
some analogy of honey, oil.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.710
That is, it is precisely a need

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.070
for well-being, in a social order.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:23.750
I occupy a certain niche on

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.950
the existing social ladder.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.930
This niche provides me with

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:33.950
social well-being and I am

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.750
satisfied with what I have achieved

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.930
in life right now.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.740
The second type of factors

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.500
that Geisberg proposes are external

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.560
or hygienic factors.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.040
These are working conditions,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.560
wages, relationships between

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.260
people in the group, relationships

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.360
between people in the workforce

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.280
in which I work, conflicting,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.440
supporting whether people

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.740
put the sticks in the

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.520
wheels or not.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.260
Whether the employee is considered

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.520
as a means, as a screw for achieving

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.900
the goal, or the company

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.560
pays great attention to the development

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.440
and growth of personnel, gives the

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.960
opportunity to train,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.980
opens up prospects for career growth,

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.820
the management style that exists

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.020
in the company, again,

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.280
unacceptable, unpleasant, the

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.200
company gives the opportunity

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.220
to develop, the company

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:46.320
gives the opportunity to realize.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.700
That is, hygienic factors, in fact,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:56.240
are those factors that can reduce

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.620
job dissatisfaction, but... And

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:11.700
here it is very important And today

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.260
it has already become asami

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.320
work with staff that hygienic

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.400
factors increase wages can reduce

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.460
my dissatisfaction with

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.300
work by being forced to spend

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.500
5 days a week, from

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.740
9 to 6 days sitting at work.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.420
But I understand at least that

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.380
I am staying out to

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.520
get a certain material reward.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.340
But!

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.800
Even if this discontent

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.680
with work is reduced, hygienic

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.040
factors cannot have a significant

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.000
impact on the increase

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.660
in labor productivity.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.760
You can raise a person’s salary,

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.260
but, nevertheless, if a person

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.460
is not satisfied with the work

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.800
he does, the team in which he works,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.660
the management that exists,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.300
he will still not be that

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:11.680
work, but the increase of work

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.480
will be perceived as due.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.440
I don’t get late to work,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.320
I report on time,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.800
and I’m paid for doing

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.320
it better than others do,

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.080
but I’m still dissatisfied.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.760
Herbert in his two-factor theory

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.880
of motivation, in essence,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.360
set and formulated the tasks of

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.600
satisfaction of dissatisfaction

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.360
with work, and it was Herbert

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.720
that formulated the position

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.720
that satisfaction with work,

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.400
satisfaction with work

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.120
I do, is a function of the content

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.600
of work that I do, and

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.480
dissatisfaction with work is

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.420
a function of working conditions,

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.140
if I do not like working conditions,

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.600
then I am not satisfied with

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.540
my labor obligations with

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.620
what I do, and the content

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.100
of work itself can

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.120
be satisfactory for me.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.200
And that is exactly where we need

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.660
to find that balance.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.440
The balance between internal

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.600
factors is my satisfaction

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.080
and external factors, hygienic,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.780
which have an effect

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.740
on my dissatisfaction

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.460
with work.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.340
After all, it takes me two hours to

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.760
get to work, and even through the

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.740
traffic jams.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.760
That means I have to get up early.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.440
After work, you have to go

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.940
home for a long time.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.480
This is all that is, of course, unsatisfactory.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.240
Not for nothing, very often one

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.660
of the points that is associated

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.920
with the acceptance of an employee

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.140
candidate for employment

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.380
is how much time it takes

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.580
to get to work.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.340
If this is a very long time, then

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.740
we can immediately say that the candidate

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.140
for one or another vacancy will

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.980
be laid down in discontent.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.880
Not immediately, but it will

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.040
appear.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.340
If it takes more than 45 minutes

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.660
to get to work, it is statistics

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.480
that were obtained

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.600
by lucrative researchers,

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.680
they love statistics and

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.420
they have everything measured,

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.520
that is, there is something

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.840
that a person will not

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.440
work effectively.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.860
Half a day he will recover, half

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.400
a day he will think that he will

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.500
have a long time to return.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.760
Therefore, as the study

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.140
shows, the time spent to

00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.240
get to work should be up

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.360
to 45 minutes.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.000
Well, again, these are ideal

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.900
conditions that we would like

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.700
them to have, but it is not

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.580
always possible.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.200
Helsberg's concept laid the foundations

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:19.120
for the analysis of business

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.600
processes and, in fact, contributed

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.580
to the translation of the theory

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.160
of oil from the point of view of psychology

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.280
in general applicable to labor motivation,

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.140
to engineering or industrial-

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.160
organizational psychology.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.390
And the last, third concept that

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.050
we will need for the next,

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.110
is also a basic concept,

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.870
the theory of motivation developed

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.330
by MacLeland.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.010
This is what McLeland is about, again,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.770
in the middle of the last century.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.270
Well, let it be the 60s, it’

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.370
s still the middle.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:04.810
And MacLean, in fact, tried to

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:09.810
solve the same question.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.850
What motivational needs are

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.950
there for a person, which

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.270
have a fundamental, significant

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.250
impact on the results of

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.610
his work activity.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.270
McLeland, having conducted a large

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.070
number of experiments, a large number

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.690
of observations, having collected

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.950
statistics, of course, he worked

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.890
not alone, but he worked with

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.870
a team of authors.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.330
In addition to the collective of authors,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.630
he analyzed the large literature

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.490
that had been accumulated by that time.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.990
He analyzed the experience of different

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:50.390
successful companies, different

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:51.710
business representatives,

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:57.770
American, European, Eastern.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.130
And McLeon concluded that of all

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:06.010
the abundance of needs – primary,

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.610
secondary, spiral-oil,

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.250
herbs needs, of all the other

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.470
theories that exist, these

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:16.270
are thousand-page books

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:17.350
describing the theory

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:18.890
of motivation.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:23.070
So, if we want to really

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.970
get a working pragmatic tool,

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.390
then from all this abundance,

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.730
we can distinguish three basic

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.450
needs that have a fundamental

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.390
influence, a fundamental impact

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.670
on labor motivation, affecting

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:43.010
which, influencing which, systematizing

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.570
which, intersecting

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.650
with which, you

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.750
can a significant change

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:54.890
in the motivational

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.650
behavior of a person.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.970
As for McLean, he had

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.390
a practical task.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.130
There are many motives, many needs.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:09.270
Here are the buttons

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:13.370
you can press to get

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:18.350
the desired work results.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.410
From McLeland’s point of

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.410
view, and consequently this

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:24.790
point of view has

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:26.930
been repeatedly confirmed,

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.710
at least the fact that his concept

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.250
remains basic for a long

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.590
time can highlight three

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.010
key needs.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.910
The first need

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:46.030
is the need to results.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.130
In fact, it is the answer

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:53.470
to the question of how well

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.010
I work, how well,

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.590
quickly, qualitatively

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.670
I all the results I need to.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.490
Every man has a need for achievement,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.290
and as for man, every man

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.170
sets a certain level, a certain

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:14.070
level, a certain need, a certain

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.890
level of claims for what

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.850
I claim, what I want to,

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.930
and accordingly

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.050
this certain ideal.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.590
Here a young specialist after the university

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.230
came to work and he sets the task of

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:38.570
becoming the head of the department

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:42.510
in 3, 5, 6 years, becoming an authoritative

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.070
specialist, becoming a consultant,

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.570
becoming an assistant of the head.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.610
Depending on the structure

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:50.730
of the organization

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:53.370
he has, he sets a

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.110
certain bar that

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.750
he pretends to.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.990
It is natural.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.650
Everyone is so arranged what?

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.330
Before he starts doing something,

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.010
he sets a goal for himself.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.130
The goal is to satisfy

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.890
one or another need

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.550
to act within one or

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.750
another motive.

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.990
The employee has set

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.850
a goal.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.350
These are the demands he claims.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.410
Then there is feedback.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.910
People begin to appreciate

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:35.030
the achievements they have.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.750
In fact, he is assessing this delta

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.090
between the level of his claims

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.050
and the level of his achievements.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.930
Three years have passed, and

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.610
I am all as a sales manager, so

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.650
a sales manager and I remain.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.170
He was neither a senior manager nor

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.390
a senior manager.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.570
Yes, I do well with the planned

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:05.550
tasks that are given to me, but those

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.010
employees who came with me have

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.190
already received some personal growth,

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:14.030
are included in the personnel

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.870
reserve, are sent to some

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:16.990
training systems.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.750
Well, of course, being in any organization,

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:21.050
in any team, you feel your

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:24.810
value and the value of the

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.510
people around you.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.350
Accordingly, I compare the

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.510
achievements I have with those

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.250
of others, and in fact I give

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.990
myself an assessment.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.110
I am successful or I am not successful.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.970
Can I really claim to

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.290
the bar that I set myself,

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.930
or will it all remain

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.070
an unrealistic reality?

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.270
The need to is a very

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.350
essential need.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.090
In fact, it is a need that shapes

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.510
my satisfaction with work.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.670
If I results, it means that

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.250
my satisfaction with work

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.170
increases.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.390
I have managed to find myself,

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.970
and what I spend most of my time

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.110
working on is finding the

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:20.070
incarnations, the results that are.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.130
Accordingly, everyone evaluates

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:28.430
the ratio of what I and

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:32.610
what I get when I spend

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.030
time working.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.430
The need to is indeed

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.890
a very important need.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.650
We all need to know what we stand for.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:43.130
This is what McLeland describes

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.670
as the need for achievement.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:50.030
The second need, which

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.770
is the key, button for labor

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.150
motivation, is the

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.070
need for power.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.250
The need for power is not

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.950
in the sense that power is political,

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.310
although it may be a need for

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:09.330
power; it is the ability, the

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.450
ability to control the circumstances

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.210
that I have to influence,

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:19.690
and to influence other people,

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:23.130
those people who work directly

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.410
with me, those people who

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.130
are in my subordination,

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.390
those people who lead me,

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.770
so that they give me high appreciation

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.610
and accordingly understand

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.810
that if I make some proposals,

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.950
it is justified and

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.790
therefore these

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.690
proposals can

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.910
be fulfilled.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.670
Power as control.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:57.010
I don’t think this need will raise

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:00.610
any controversy or questions.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.610
Man is simply so arranged that he wants

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:09.190
to be the master of his behavior,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.610
the master of his position.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.070
And of course, if it is about work, if

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.090
it is about business, about labor motivation,

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.070
then in this case I want to keep under

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.130
control the conditions of my work,

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.350
the conditions of my career growth,

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.210
the conditions of my materiality

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.590
mutation, the conditions of

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:33.310
my social package, to keep them under

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:37.030
control and change them into the

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.430
side that meets me, the side

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:40.930
of the increase, the side

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:42.950
of getting all the new plaque

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:43.770
and so on.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.230
Power as control.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.770
Control in a broad sense.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.430
In principle, power is a translation

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:52.550
of the English word power, that is,

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.050
unusual, again, to our Russian mentality,

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:59.190
power as the leadership of someone,

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.970
power as control and influence

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.530
on other people, influence from

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.290
the point of view of manipulation,

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.930
influence from the

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:11.370
point of view of authority.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.070
But if I said something, I must

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:16.390
know that it will be done,

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:19.090
I must be sure that I was able

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.750
to organize something, and this

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.250
organization is based on control,

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.950
control of certain labor

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.290
processes.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:33.830
The third key need for a person

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.290
is the need for acceptance.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:40.250
This is a tribute, of course, to the human

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.830
nature, first and most importantly, and secondly,

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.410
it is a tribute to the concept of oil.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.030
Man lives among other people,

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:55.030
being a being, and in any case,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.850
my behavior, my actions, my

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:01.010
successes, my failures,

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:03.790
my achievements are what I

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:05.610
compare to what another

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:06.590
person has.

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.270
We do not work alone, we work

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:11.970
in contact with different people,

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:15.750
and every person needs

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.890
to experience respect from

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:19.710
other people.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.970
I must be accepted by others, I must

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:26.190
be authoritative by others.

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:30.330
And others will come to

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.570
me for advice, advice, help.

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.090
Other people consider me

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.830
a professional, and others consider

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.930
me a professional.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:48.810
This again gives me

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:51.530
some satisfaction.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:54.190
It is the realization of my

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:57.970
meta-needs, the realization of my social

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.950
value, the realization of my place

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.750
on the ladder of the social hierarchy,

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:08.030
the realization of my authority.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:12.130
So here are the three basic key

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.050
button needs that McLeland highlights

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.270
– achievement, power, and

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.230
acceptance.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:22.670
Furthermore, depending on the relationship

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.830
between these needs,

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:27.410
how these needs are realized,

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.610
McLeland solves the problem

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:34.170
of the effectiveness of the

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:36.550
manager, the effectiveness

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.230
of the work motivation

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:42.250
that should be in order

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:45.070
to business results.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.370
Per the basic position,

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.650
defended, developed, and

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:53.030
supported by McLeanland

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.710
and his supporters,

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.690
is that if I consider

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.430
managers, then for effective

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.350
managers, those

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:06.610
who results.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:09.230
Those who know how to organize work,

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.610
who know how to organize the

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.910
execution of certain actions, the

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:17.230
first place is the aspiration, the

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:20.250
need for achievement and power,

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.490
and only then the need for

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.050
acceptance arises.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.810
Again, we can recall from our own

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:29.450
experience many successful executives,

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.790
many successful business owners,

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:33.750
who first think about the

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:37.030
need to keep everything under

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.470
control, secondly, to to

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:44.770
take up their business low,

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:49.090
to take up a particular segment

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:52.870
of the market.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:55.630
Only after these needs are

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:58.350
met, another question

00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:58.990
arises.

00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.000


00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.180
How are I now being assessed?

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.140
What type of action should

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.360
be taken so that the attitude towards

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.800
me by employees, colleagues, society

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:20.180
is more or less acceptable,

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.380
so that it is in one way

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.020
or another socially

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.620
significant?

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.740
Here is McLilland’s theory of motivation

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.700
and its charm, its advantages

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.580
are that it gives three

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:39.040
characteristics that can

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.660
be controlled, that can be influenced,

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.360
that can be correlated

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.380
with each other to get

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.020
a certain direction

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.060
in the work motivation

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.080
that I want to realize.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.400
We are, as I said, based

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.220
on these three basic concepts.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.600
All other concepts, of which a

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.480
large number, in one way or another

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.240
are based on Maslow concepts,

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.660
MacLeland concepts, Gersberg

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.820
concepts.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.580
And then, when we and you will

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:19.540
be dealing with concrete examples,

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.820
we will see.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.740
The next question we will consider

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.240
today will be related to, but

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.360
how to improve the motivation

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.420
of work?

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.140
We discussed the basic concept

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.560
with you, talked about the

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.960
approaches with which they

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.400
try to direct the motivation

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.620
of employees in the right direction.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.740
We will still have an interesting

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.300
specific question on how to

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.720
improve the motivation of employees.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.440
This problem, again, has as many

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.560
solutions as the authors have

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.080
tried to address it.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.940
Every manager, every manager,

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.180
every manager has their own vision,

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.560
their own understanding, and this

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.160
understanding depends on what they

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.480
do, their experience, the

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.920
sphere of markets in which the

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.920
company operates, and some general

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.260
recommendations to give is

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.260
quite difficult.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.680
However, you can try on the basis

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.580
of the analysis of the literature

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.460
of the RAZ, on the basis of the analysis

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.640
of the efficiency of work, the effectiveness

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.380
of building a motivation system

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.020
in different companies to highlight

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.100
those points that have

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.640
a significant impact on improving motivation.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.840
Well, in fact, in this case, we

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.360
are facing the same task that

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.480
was faced by McLeland to highlight

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.700
from all the abundance of

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.740
needs factors those key buttons

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.160
that can be pressed

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.180
to get the motivation we want.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.280
As for the ways to

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.060
motivate work, there

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.360
are five main ways.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.320
I want to draw your attention again.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.500
In literature you can find two, three,

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.700
five, one hundred, five, two hundred

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.780
and fifteen, and three hundred

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.120
and fifteen ways.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.460
But since our purpose with you and our

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.340
task with you is to structure these

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.960
methods, let us consider these approaches

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.200
so that they can then find their

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.500
application and application

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.940
in certain different working

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.680
conditions.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.160
The first way that I think everyone

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.980
comes to mind right away, which

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.720
is the most common, especially

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.380
in the domestic environment,

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.020
a significant one that has established

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.680
itself, which is indeed a very

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.660
powerful motivation, especially

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:06.400
for those employees who do not

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.280
yet have enough

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.300
experience to work who are

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.120
looking for themselves,

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.700
is, of course, material labor

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.400
stimulation.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.460
What does any employee want to

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.800
come to work?

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.400
He wants, remember Herzberg,

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:32.300
that the work should be

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.240
interesting and satisfying,

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.380
but the primary motivation

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:41.380
that arises when I go

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.020
to work is the question

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.160
of what material stimulation

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.420
will be.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.500
What will be my salary?

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.520
How it will grow, what will the salary

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.280
for the trial period, whether the

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.680
annual review system will be implemented,

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.540
and the salary will increase according

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.880
to the results of work.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.700
In the end, we work to make

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.900
money, because in this way we can

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.380
ensure that all of our basic

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.060
and meta needs are meticulously

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.180
meticulous.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.060
Our economy, our economic

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.620
relations, our society, our

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.780
politics are organized in such

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.160
a way that everything revolves

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.100
around the material means

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.760
necessary to obtain certain

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.220
material goods.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.440
I invest my time, my efforts

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.960
in work, I produce something,

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.180
but I need something else.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.000
I get money for my work and

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.240
I buy everything I want or as

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.940
much as I can buy according

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.620
to what I get.

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:51.650
The next way to get motivation

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:56.250
is to improve the quality and

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.790
level of the workforce.

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:00.510
This is a way that is very important

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.090
for business.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.570
Indeed, people work in the company,

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:08.990
people are loyal to the company, people

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:12.030
have experience staying in the

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:13.650
company, know the underwater stones

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.330
that exist here, know the company’

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:17.290
s place in the market.

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:18.670
After all, they are the owners-

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.130
bearers of corporate

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:21.510
information, confidential

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.050
information, and accordingly

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:26.430
the business owner is interested

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.770
in not to get this

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:30.810
information outside the company.

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:33.890
Therefore, people, staff should be

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:36.910
given the opportunity to get their

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:39.310
development within the company.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:41.730
That is, organizing a system of training

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.870
and development of personnel are very

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:47.510
important qualities that will be

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:52.130
related to the motivation of work.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:55.570
If an employee sees that the company

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:58.390
is investing in his training,

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:00.750
therefore, the employee feels

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:01.830
that the company is

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.230
interested in him working

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:05.870
in it.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.710
And again, in return, he will,

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:12.250
based on the gratitude of the company,

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:14.870
based on the fact that he sees his

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:16.870
further place, his further work

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:19.090
in this company, strives to work

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:20.770
better, strives to invest better,

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.770
and those funds that have been

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.390
invested in building his training,

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:27.010
they repeatedly smoke.

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:30.950
In addition to training, the improvement

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:33.030
of the quality of the workforce, the improvement

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.930
of the quality of the functioning

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:36.390
of the staff contributes various programs

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:38.850
for the development of the staff.

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:41.370
Indeed, the development of personnel implies

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:44.250
the presence of a personnel reserve,

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:49.050
the construction of a career path.

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:52.930
That is, a person should know

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.950
what positions he can occupy in the

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.670
company, what requirements

00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:00.570
arise for each position.

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:02.650
The company must exist, there

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:03.830
may be a system of grading,

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.510
a system of key performance

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:07.930
indicators.

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.770
In the end, the employee should

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:12.570
see the prospects that are missing

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:13.730
before him.

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.330
Again, let’s remember that all motivation

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.570
is the cause of behavior, and

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:19.310
the cause of behavior requires

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.110
a goal.

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:23.010
Today I work in a regular

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:27.350
position, today I get, well,

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:29.510
say so, not as much money

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:31.010
as I want to get.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:34.190
I have two ways, either I can find

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:37.050
another job where I will be paid

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:42.250
more, or I can aspire to grow,

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:45.250
to develop within the company

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:48.090
where I will earn more, where

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.670
my weight, my authority,

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:53.090
my knowledge will gradually

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:56.490
grow, and accordingly, where

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:58.930
my social status will rise.

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:02.330
In addition, if we talk about the

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:04.610
coverage of the quality of the workforce,

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:07.130
then from the point of view of

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:09.510
human resource management, there

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:12.810
is a task of assessing the staff.

00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:16.710
How efficiently does

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:18.830
a person perform his duties?

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:23.070
What competencies does he already have?

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:25.150
What competencies he lacks

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.510
and is desirable to add

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:30.090
them so that he is even more

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:33.830
successful in implementing

00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:36.390
the functionality he has.

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:41.010
Accordingly, the evaluation of personnel

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:44.230
is the procedure that will allow the

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.730
company, on the one hand, to understand

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.850
whether it has enough human resources

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:51.750
to solve its task, or still need

00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.670
to go out to the market and look

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:55.970
for external specialists

00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:57.670
and lure them into the company

00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:01.390
to change the functioning

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:02.930
of personnel and improve

00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:05.590
its work, or I will not turn

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.470
to the external market, but

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:09.010
will grow specialists

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.990
by myself.

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:12.590
Here, in terms of domestic

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:14.770
specifics, it is often said

00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:16.650
that companies are trying to

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:21.470
buy over, to trick the best specialists

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:24.070
from the side, but this

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:26.230
is a stick in the two ends.

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:28.450
Today you changed, tomorrow you

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:30.070
have the same specialist by

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:33.790
another company and accordingly

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.490
these relationships of buying and

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.670
selling they do not always give the

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:41.130
desired result.

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:43.690
And of course, when we talk about

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:46.310
improving the quality of the

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:48.370
workforce, there is a

00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:50.230
problem with motivation.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.930
What motivation systems, what

00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:56.510
motivation schemes can be offered

00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:58.790
to make a person interested

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.770
in working in a given company,

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:03.710
was interested in development

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.750
within a given company, so that

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.610
a person was loyal to the company,

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:12.070
was a carrier of corporate ideas,

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.310
values, culture, stereotypes

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:17.530
and accordingly felt part

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:18.990
of this company.

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:20.430
The problem of improving the quality

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:24.110
of the workforce is a very expensive procedure,

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.830
because both training, development, and

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:29.570
evaluation, and the introduction of

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:32.330
new motivation schemes, motivation

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.970
schemes related to pay, with material

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.430
motivation, with intangible motivation

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:37.330
– this is all that requires additional

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:39.250
efforts, all that requires calculation,

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.310
analytics, and again in

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:44.750
this situation, you should

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:47.470
not expect a return immediately.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:48.430


01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:49.630
This is a very important moment.

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:53.790
Often managers, having good intentions

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:56.310
associated with increasing their

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.170
business performance and willing

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:00.110
to invest in personnel development,

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:04.670
see that the returns of the

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:07.390
one they want in the time

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:08.770
they want, they do not

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:09.430
receive.

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:13.770
In this regard, they stop throwing

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.990
money out of their viewpoint and

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:18.470
move to the old, good,

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.990
traditionally authoritarian

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:21.850
methods of management.

01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:25.010
If you don’t want to work, go,

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:26.790
we’ll find someone who will

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:29.310
do the same job for the same

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:32.290
money in the same place as

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:33.030
we need.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.910
This, by the way, is a cleaning specificity,

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.730
which, unfortunately, is very and very common.

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:42.470
We will talk about this today a little

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.390
later, when we are about building different

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.550
motivation systems in Russia.

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:51.250
The next way to improve

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.510
motivation is to improve

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.130
the organization of work.

01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:59.270
This is directly related to those

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:00.990
concepts of Geller, which we talked

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:02.430
about with you.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.410
How to disassemble employees,

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:09.910
how to organize a workplace,

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:12.130
where to place equipment,

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:14.650
how to provide ventilation,

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:16.750
to equip the workplace,

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:19.370
to equip relaxation rooms, so

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:21.750
that the employee, coming to

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.010
work, has the opportunity for

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:28.090
some time to recover, relieve

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:30.390
fatigue and get rid

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.550
of stress.

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:33.350
Because we all understand that working

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.410
in business is constant stress,

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:37.810
it is constant functioning

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:40.870
in conditions of lack of time,

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:42.310
in conditions of time cytotic,

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:44.910
it is constant performance

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:47.570
of different kinds of functions,

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.110
when the same employee must

01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:50.610
prepare different reports,

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.130
different departments,

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.730
from different bosses,

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.710
but at the same time.

01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:58.590
Therefore, the problem of time management

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.630
is necessary - the organization

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:01.690
of working time.

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:04.410
Time management is

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:06.090
necessary in terms of managing

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:09.710
the time of the employee.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.630
A properly implemented system

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:15.810
of goal setting is necessary.

01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:19.890
Not just saying that by the end of the

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:22.690
month you should raise a sales plan.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.250
It is an uncertain task.

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:26.330
How much to raise?

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.150
How to increase?

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.370
Well, I raised the sales plan by 2%,

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:32.750
and the manager meant 10%, and there

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:34.350
is a misunderstanding accordingly.

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.190
And here is not so much the fault of the

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:37.770
manager, but the fault of inadequately

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:38.710
set goals.

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:41.690
Accordingly, when we talk about improving

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:42.950
the organization of labor, it

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.450
is also a problem of building a management

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:48.090
vertical, it is a problem

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.730
of building relationships at the horizontal

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:53.650
level, it is a problem of assessing

01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:58.090
the success of the functioning

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:01.370
of one employee, the success

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.690
of building the process of communication

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:05.670
of this employee with other

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:07.050
employees and again in

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:11.250
terms of the employee's

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:14.110
compliance with the position

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:15.870
occupied.

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:20.010
The next way to improve

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.250
motivation is to involve staff

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:24.890
in the management process.

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:28.730
For Russian tradition, this

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.690
is a relatively new approach,

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:34.090
which has not yet found sufficient spread.

01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:38.150
But for Western business, this

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:40.710
process has long been implemented,

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:43.890
because if a person is involved

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:46.590
in the process of managing a

01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:50.770
business, it doesn’t matter what

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:52.490
level it is.

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:55.510
Whether it is the organization of the work of

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:58.090
the department, the level is the organization

01:04:58.090 --> 01:04:59.470
of the work of two managers who

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.530
are next to each other.

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.710
Is this the level of organization,

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:04.510
management of the company as a whole,

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:06.110
the construction of a

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:07.270
system of relationships, intersection

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.810
within different departments?

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:12.410
The main thing is that a person begins

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:15.490
to feel his need for a company,

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:18.410
and a person begins to think that

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:21.070
he is not a simple pedestrian

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:22.790
in this company, what is considered

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:26.250
with him, his opinion is asked,

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:29.690
he is respected.

01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:34.190
As they say, let a man have

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.230
faith in his need.

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:37.650
Remember, we talked to you about

01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.450
the need for recognition from Maheland.

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:43.850
And this belief in necessity

01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:46.770
is a very strong guiding motive

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:49.090
for which a person will be

01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:51.750
placed, for which a person will

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:53.830
strive to make those or other

01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:56.530
achievements that he would

01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:59.090
not do under normal conditions.

01:05:59.090 --> 01:05:59.690


01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:01.070
No matter how you raise his

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.950
salary, no matter what more advantageous

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.290
offers you offer him.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.690
People are so arranged that

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:15.470
they need not only to feel their

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:20.570
importance, but also to see that they

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:24.990
are valued, that they should think

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:26.310
that they are in their place, and

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.170
only then will they hold on

01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:30.410
to that place.

01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:34.950
The next item that is associated

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:37.490
with improving motivation is

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:39.830
non-monetary incentives.

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:43.010
This is called intangible

01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:46.390
stimulation of labor.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:49.190
This type of stimulation begins

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:50.370
to get its spread and development

01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:53.110
in those conditions when the business

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.050
is already sufficiently developed

01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:58.630
when the business is already sufficiently

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:00.390
stable when the campaign has

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:03.250
a certain place in the market

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:06.570
when the campaign has a certain

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.990
background certain traditions

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:10.430
when the company has a

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:12.170
certain b resting소 here The

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:14.330
brand itself is already a very

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.990
interesting non-money stimulation

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:18.230
method, when the staff

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.350
is ready to come to

01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:21.810
the company for a lower salary,

01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:25.350
for a bigger job than in another,

01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:28.070
but it is a brand company, and

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:29.790
neighboring companies

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:32.290
are just beginning to develop

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:34.370
and, accordingly, has

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:36.150
not yet had time to win

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:37.710
authority.

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:40.130
The non-monetary or intangible

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:43.750
stimulation system has not yet

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:46.310
gained widespread spread

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:49.090
in Russia, although large

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.090
large companies that exist in

01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:56.930
Russia, mostly a company with

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:58.690
foreign capital, they

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:02.170
provide a large block

01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:05.850
of intangible stimulation

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:07.910
in the compensation

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:09.590
package, which is very

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:11.690
attractive and interesting

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.250
for staff.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:15.410
What we will talk about later.

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:19.370
So, look, here are again the

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.130
five main areas in which

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.270
action and efforts are currently

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.430
being made to improve

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:26.670
motivation.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.750
Again, I want to say, you can argue

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.590
with some of them that this direction

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:34.250
will not work, this direction

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:35.870
is so important.

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.630
These directions do not mean that each

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:42.590
of them needs to be implemented in your

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:44.490
company, and that each of them in

01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:46.290
your company will make a profit.

01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:48.970
Again, it is necessary to remember,

01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:51.570
this is what is an accumulation

01:08:51.570 --> 01:08:54.530
of world business experience, but

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.210
each company has its own specifics,

01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:59.270
and accordingly you can take what

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:01.630
is more available in your

01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:02.850
company, corresponds to its

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.690
market position, corresponds to

01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:06.030
its ranking, corresponds to

01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:07.830
its quotation, corresponds in the

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:10.510
end to the financial

01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:12.170
and economic indicators that the

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.690
company has.

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:16.330
Again, you may ask, and why there

01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:18.770
are no other ways to motivate

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:21.650
work here, for example, related

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.550
there with foreign trips,

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:26.610
with the provision of loans

01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:27.930
for apartments, and so on.

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:30.030
These are the specifics that we will

01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:31.170
talk about with you.

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.790
Just now I would like to indicate

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:37.150
the main paths and goals, and the

01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:38.930
specific content, it will already

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:41.630
depend on the functions of

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:45.950
tasks that arise in your activities.

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:51.250
So, maybe now let us turn

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:56.130
to such a problem as material

01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:58.930
and intangible stimulation.

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:01.330
What these two approaches are

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.050
about, on the one hand, is the

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:07.270
most obvious, most understandable,

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.110
most easily perceived ways

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:10.670
of stimulating labor,

01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.210
which either contribute to motivating

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:14.810
employees and staff, or,

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.850
on the other hand, build them,

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:21.030
build a line of demobilization

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:24.170
and, accordingly, hinder the

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:26.850
realization of the economic

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.350
indicators that the company

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:30.710
is facing.

01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:34.450
What methods of material

01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:37.250
stimulation are usually used?

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:39.130
The easiest way is, of course, the

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:41.390
method of material stimulation by the

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:42.430
results of work.

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:45.950
The employee executes the

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.470
plan and, accordingly, he receives

01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:49.830
a certain material reward

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:51.910
for the execution of that plan.

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.310
This reward is usually divided into

01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.990
two parts.

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:57.570
There is a certain fixed portion

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:01.270
that the employee will receive anyway.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.030
This is the part that

01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:06.030
the hospital pay for.

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:07.990
This is the part with which

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:11.290
the periods of absence of the employee

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:12.770
at work are repaid.

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:14.770
And this is the part that

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:17.090
is paid to the employee only for

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:20.070
the fact that he serves his working

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:23.170
time from 9 to 6, from 10

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:26.030
to 7, who has any internal

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:28.230
labor regulations.

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:31.630
At the same time, there is a bonus

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:33.870
or variable part of the payout,

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.470
which is paid to the employee by

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:39.510
the results of his personal,

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:41.410
direct work during the month, by

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:45.550
increasing the volume of sales,

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:49.170
by expanding the market of

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.790
services he offers, by increasing

01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:52.830
the number of clients he

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.830
brings to the company.

01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:58.270
That is, if the fixed part is what

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.870
you are paid only for the fact of

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:02.670
your presence at the workplace,

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:05.610
then the variable part is what

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:08.210
is a reflection of your contribution,

01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:12.110
your work motivation.

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:15.470
If you want to earn more

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:17.070
– be more active, spend

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.870
more time promoting

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.070
services, signing contracts,

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:25.830
finding customers, and you

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:27.170
will get more.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:30.830
This is a very good

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:34.390
motivation that is

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:40.450
effective first work as

01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:41.670
an employee.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:44.230
While I am entering the business,

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:46.970
while I am gaining experience, and again,

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:50.170
here it is necessary to say that the systems

01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:52.410
of this material variable part

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:53.270
are different.

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.570
There are progressive

01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:59.130
systems, depending on the

01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.810
more results you, the

01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:04.450
greater the variable you get.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:08.630
There are regressive systems.

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:11.450
The simple thing is that in the end,

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:14.070
every company is interested

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:16.030
in making a profit and letting

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:19.170
it not only on the salary, but also

01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:20.710
on the expansion of production,

01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:23.970
on the replacement of equipment, on

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:26.790
the connection of different telecommunications

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.450
systems, and so on, and accordingly,

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:32.410
you need to find a balance of some

01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:35.790
sort, so that the employee can

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:38.770
be stimulated, on the one hand,

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:40.030
but on the other, to leave

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:42.110
the means for the direct

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:44.590
development of the business.

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:48.850
There are many different variable

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:51.770
motivation systems, and in principle,

01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:53.330
partly we will talk about it a

01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:54.690
little later when we touch the construction

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:57.810
of the motivation system

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:00.230
in Russian conditions.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.430
Again, in the literature that is

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:05.910
offered to you, many different schemes

01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:08.550
of building material, specifically

01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:10.250
material stimulation are described,

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:13.330
as we are talking about.

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:17.050
In addition to this material

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:19.750
incentive, there is a bonus system.

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:22.990
These bonuses can be one-time

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.050
really for some outstanding

01:14:25.050 --> 01:14:27.110
results, for solving certain

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:28.310
problems.

01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:32.450
Or periodically, when a person, when an

01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:35.010
employee performing their functions,

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:37.790
successfully performing them, receives

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:42.250
additional payment for his work on

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:46.670
the basis of the implementation

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:47.650
of the plan.

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:50.810
Different tasks can be solved with this

01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:51.970
bonus scheme.

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:55.050
It is necessary to keep

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:57.510
employees in tone.

01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.930
Because you will always get a fixed

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:01.270
portion, but this extra

01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:03.330
portion, if you work successfully,

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:04.870
you will receive those

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.050
bonuses.

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:10.350
But there are different circumstances,

01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:12.930
and if suddenly the effectiveness

01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.270
of your work began to systematically

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:18.910
fall, then the question is whether

01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:21.950
it is appropriate to pay you

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.370
this constant bonus.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.000
Moreover, the bonus system of labor

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.800
is what is often prescribed

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.600
in the employment contract that

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.020
the employee concludes, and

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.960
this is what the employee

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.540
can claim, because these are

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.120
the expectations he receives

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.500
from the work, concluded

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.000
in his employment contract.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.060
But, in addition to this, there are

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:52.860
also so-called stimulating payments, which

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.060
are implemented by the management on

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.560
its own discretion.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.500
The management can encourage the

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.080
employee for the result.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.360
Management can encourage the

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.700
employee to the prospect that he

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:12.360
feels that he is not part of

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.960
some form of the faceless grey mass,

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.440
and that behind his successes,

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.080
his achievements is observed

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.520
by the manager that he can get

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.440
assistance from his more successful,

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.640
more so that

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:35.460
he is not afraid to experiment.

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.400
We all understand that while

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.720
we gain experience, we

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.300
can make mistakes,

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.080
we can get some results.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.040
And in order to maintain positive

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.380
moments in the work of employees,

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.940
its functioning, its initiative,

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.840
its desire to take on additional

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.840
responsibility, all this

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.320
can get such a one-time

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.660
stimulation at the

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.560
discretion of the management.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.420
Someone may get it, someone

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.820
may not get it.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.000
Again, the way this arbitrary

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.140
stimulation is constructed

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.480
depends on the policy in human

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.520
resource management

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.220
that is implemented in

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.500
a company that exists

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.180
in a particular firm.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.120
And this system of stimulation,

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.320
it largely forms a favorable

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.420
psychological climate of work

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.780
in the team, forms the

01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:39.580
desire of the staff to stay

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.480
in this company, and not to

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.660
look for another company.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.280
Still, what matters to

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.840
material stimulation is a

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.960
relatively well-worked topic.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.020
There are different schemes for building

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.500
a material-stimulated system

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.520
of bonuses and compensations, I

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.560
would like to stop now, including

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.520
on intangible stimulation

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.800
or on the formation of a compensation

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.700
package.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.840
And its name, more familiar and

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.780
as eliminated, is a social package

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.540
that would provide the company

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.820
to its employees.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.740
When we come to work, to get

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.880
to work, the person, again,

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.280
understands that in addition

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.720
to material stimulation,

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.160
he can get something else

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.300
from this work.

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.460
Some additional social package,

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.360
some additional services, some

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.120
additional opportunities that

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.300
the company provides its employees

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.100
by the results of their work,

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.480
by the time of their work, by

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.960
their contribution to the

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.200
achievement of the results

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.860
that are in the company.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.240
The social package in different companies

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.280
is different.

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.560
But again, the problem is that

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.260
the social package is still a certain

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:08.340
part of the company's profit,

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.160
which goes down to development,

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.340
and accordingly, it

01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:15.080
is some additional services,

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.300
some additional opportunities

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.160
that the company

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.600
provides to its employees.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.880


01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.480
Not in cash, but in

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.240
terms of additional services

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.080
and opportunities

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.500
that you can use as

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.600
long as you are an

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.520
employee of this company.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.240


01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.920
What elements are usually included in

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.100
the social package?

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.240
Health insurance is often

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.400
used for employees and

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.660
their family members.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.780
Again, the scheme here can be different.

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.120
This can be the full payment

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.580
of medical insurance.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.100
This can be a discount when paying

01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.280
for medical insurance.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.980
The staff is given the opportunity

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.360
to choose different medical

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.020
care schemes.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.780
And depending on the duration

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.820
of your work in the company,

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:14.220
depending on your status in

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.660
the company, depending on

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.480
the bets that management makes

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.360
on you, you can get different

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.660
schemes in the rising

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.060
or decreasing direction.

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.400
And these schemes can

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.840
be presented not only to you, but

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.420
also to your family members.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.880
This is again a very important

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.220
motivating moment.

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.260
You may be dissatisfied with the

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.060
amount of salary you receive.

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.420
But on the other hand, you understand

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:50.800
perfectly that working in this

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.820
company, you have the opportunity

01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:56.300
to be served in good

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.160
medical centers, and with significant

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.320
discounts.

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.800
And in fact, because this intangible

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.580
stimulation is the same as an

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:11.260
addition to the material package.

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.340
You are less polluting,

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:14.940
so you have more of the

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.520
salary you get.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.840
A very important element, a very

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.680
important part of the social

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.300
and compensation package is

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.160
the opportunity for training

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.140
and professional development.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.580
I think you all agree that

01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.140
good education, good educational

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.040
service providers where you

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.280
can get the required

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.320
skills, worked

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.620
skills are expensive.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.520
The company is naturally

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.360
interested in the fact that

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.780
the employees working in it are professional

01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.780
and competent, and naturally,

01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:01.700
first of all, such employees

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.920
and the services of the advertising

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.900
company.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:08.820
But on the other hand, we have already

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.380
talked about this, Business is constantly

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:14.260
changing, and new circumstances,

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.980
new conditions, legislative

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:18.940
documents are changing, and

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.920
all these changes need

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.120
to be tracked.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.680
Therefore, the company can pay its

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.540
employees for both individual

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:32.880
training and organize training

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.460
for the entire organization.

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.820
This is the so-called organizational

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:40.880
training, which is getting more

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.080
and more widespread today.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:46.960
As for training, this is a rather

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.040
expensive article of the organization’

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.520
s budget.

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:55.000
And this expensive item can often

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.180
not lead to the desired results,

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:01.080
and accordingly, the money spent

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.220
will not always pay off as

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.820
quickly as the management

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.760
wants.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.020
Or, on the other hand, this cost

01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.480
article can lead to a sufficiently

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.340
serious and significant

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.620
growth in the business

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:20.500
results that the company has, significantly

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:23.860
improve its competitive capabilities,

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:25.700
significantly stabilize

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.800
its position in the market,

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.900
correspond to the

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.180
expansion and greater coverage

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.780
of market segments.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.360
As for development education,

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.940
we have already talked

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.500
about it today.

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.320
Again, the main thing here is that

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.500
the employee understands that if

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.340
the company invests money in his

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.600
training, the company

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.660
is interested in him staying

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.720
in it.

01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.620
Well, of course, it makes no sense

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.680
to train the employee so that he

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.760
then goes to the competitors and

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.180
there began to use professional

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.540
knowledge and skills.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.000
The system of human resource

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.760
management is, in short,

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:13.460
aimed at shaping the loyalty

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.320
of the staff through many not

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.960
material, but social components,

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.160
which we are talking

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.660
about now.

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.360
Many companies, again, practice

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.020
various kinds of compensation,

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:32.800
for example, for lunch.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.480
As for work, we spend

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.800
9-10 hours at work and

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.720
again we have to meet our

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.740
basic needs, basic food

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.280
needs.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.460
It is often the time

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:54.020
for lunch.

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.320
What will you do at this time?

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.060
Whether you work, smoke, go really

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.060
somewhere to eat - it is already

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.600
given to the staff itself.

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:09.680
And it very often turns out that

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.120
people use this time not for

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.220
food, but for rest, to solve

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:15.940
some of their own problems,

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:19.360
to go somewhere, to do some

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.440
other things.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.540
If the company is interested in making

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:29.340
the staff have real opportunities

01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:31.400
for work, it can organize

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.520
including lunches, both within

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.200
the company and for the employees

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.540
of the company, to compensate

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.840
for the cost of these lunches

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.180
in whole or in part.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.040
In addition to lunch, we may

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.280
talk about providing a service

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.840
car, but again we understand

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.180
perfectly that in the case we

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:55.160
are talking about those managers

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.880
or employees of that level, for

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.360
whom the car is really a necessary

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.180
element in terms of performing

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.280
their official duties, so

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.340
that you can go to the relevant

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.160
organizations, inspection,

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.480
and quickly or in time

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:17.680
to solve those or other

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.840
problems.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.900
In order to be able to reach those

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:24.540
partners with whom we work,

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.340
quickly transmit the necessary

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.460
documents.

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.920
Another element can be the

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.600
introduction of mobile payment,

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.920
because today mobile phones

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.880
are no longer a luxury, but

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.380
a necessary element of our

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.120
daily activities, a necessary

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:49.480
element of effective functioning.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.900
And of course, since it is

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:55.420
a tool for work that the employee

01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.400
uses to solve the functional

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.760
tasks facing him, then again

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.800
you can compensate

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.660
for this mobile connection.

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.420


01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.020
So, what is related to

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.600
the varied compensation –

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.560
for lunch, for mobile, for

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.820
phone payments, and so on – is

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.640
another important year of intangible

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.680
incentives, because

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.960
it shows that the company

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.760
is interested in employees,

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.460
well, of course,

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.160
and there is nothing surprising

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.620
or bad about it.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.160
These are the additional opportunities

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:34.620
that the employee can

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.740
use in their interest.

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:40.240
We are all living people, and

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.480
we should not dream of

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.240
ideal employees who will talk on

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.280
the mobile phone exclusively

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.960
about work issues.

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:50.680
If this happens, then it may

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.280
cause some surprise that there

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.500
are no problems hidden here.

01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:00.700
A very important aspect in

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.720
terms of intangible stimulation

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.260
is the construction

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.660
of a non-state pension system.

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:10.300
All of us know that, as for the

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:12.560
system of state pension funds,

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.820
the pension that is provided

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.460
after the termination of work

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.180
is so insignificant,

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.300
3-5 thousand rubles, that

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.360
you can not live on them.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.820
Especially if you are used to living

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.680
for very expensive amounts.

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:38.100
That is why at present in Russia,

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.480
in the West, it has a long history,

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.240
a non-state pension fund is

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.720
formed, where the company

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.420
adds material resources, which

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:51.480
later after the end of its operational

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.700
activities and this is a very

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.980
important aspect, because

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.080
in this way the company binds

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.780
the employee to itself for

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.120
a long period of time.

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.580
In order to get a pension you

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:14.920
need to work in the company

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.620
for 5-10-15 years, depending

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:18.600
on how long you worked,

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.000
you will receive the corresponding

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.200
pension.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:27.340
Therefore, here there is a very

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:31.900
important, motivating factor that

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:36.340
binds a person to the company in

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:40.320
which he works, and then when working

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.880
in this company, there can

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.700
be various dissatisfactions,

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.440
various messes.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.640
But the very fact that you

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.500
have 2, 3, 4, 5 left there to

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.660
receive no state prizes

01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:00.140
at all, can be a very strong,

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:04.020
very powerful, very powerful

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.960
motivational factor

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.880
that will ensure the functioning

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:12.340
of a person, and functioning

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.720
professional, functioning adequate,

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.620
functioning responsible to

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.740
your workplace, because

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:23.140
you know, depending on how

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.820
successful you will solve

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.640
those or other problems,

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:31.400
this will determine the

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.160
dividends that you

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.420
will eventually get,

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.620
or what you will lose.

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:41.040
It is not a material factor, it is

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.980
not what you get now with your salary,

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.340
it is what you can get later, but

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:53.960
people so Whatever we say, we think

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.540
about the future, about what

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:59.080
will happen tomorrow, about what

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.260
will happen if we suddenly get

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:04.340
sick, if we suddenly can’t run and

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:06.640
turn, like a protein in a wheel,

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:07.760
as we turn now, if our loved

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.120
ones suddenly get sick,

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:13.880
we live in a world, we are living

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.980
people, and here we can’t

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:17.760
be insured of anything.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:23.760
In this regard, the very fact

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:27.540
of receiving a decent, sufficient

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:30.320
compensation can be the motivating

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.520
factor that will even compensate

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.680
for the dissatisfaction

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.040
with the salary received

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.120
now.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.100
This non-state pension system

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.260
can naturally be

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:45.820
implemented in stable

01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:47.760
economic conditions.

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:48.300
This is once.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.620
Secondly, it can

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.380
be implemented in large

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:53.360
companies.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:55.520
Because these deductions to pension

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.340
funds, which we are talking about

01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.680
now, are quite a significant

01:31:58.680 --> 01:31:59.880
additional deduction that

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.340
the company can withdraw from its

01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:06.900
profits and withdraw from the

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.660
prospects of its further development.

01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:14.960
However, it is possible, again, the

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.140
social package to include partial

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.800
payment for travel to the sanatorium

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.700
and holiday homes, both for employees

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.200
and for members of his family.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.080
A good rest is not cheap.

01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.400


01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.680
And in this regard, if the company

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:34.940
pays or compensates for a part of

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.740
the amount for travel, for a possible

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:40.600
trip, then this, again,

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.660
is a very important

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:43.360
stimulating moment.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.020
Let it be 20%, let it be 10%, but

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.500
here is this situation, when the

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:53.200
fact itself is important, not so much

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.840
the amount, because the employee will

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:59.520
remember that and the company has

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.880
invested in my vacation, in addition

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.400
to the vacation I got on hand, and

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.080
therefore, in this company I

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:11.720
have an interesting job because far

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.960
away But not the fact that

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.360
the company where I am promised

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.120
a lot of money, where I am promised

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.700
a less employment, will also

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:23.020
be able to carefully

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:25.500
provide the same opportunity

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.400
for the social package

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.160
that it provides me.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.140
Well, again, there are many other

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:35.760
pleasant little things that companies

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.140
can include in the social

01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:38.220
package.

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.540
It is the payment of the same fitness

01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.960
clubs, pools, gyms, holding various

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.060
kinds of corporate events, which

01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:51.160
for the company as such cost a large

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.700
amount, but on the other hand they

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.520
contribute to the development

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.580
of this unified corporate spirit,

01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:01.300
contribute to the cohesion

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.420
of the team, contribute to the formation

01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:08.360
of loyalty in the team

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.620
and contribute to the

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:12.580
formation of a sense of community.

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:15.100
This is my company.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.480
These are the conditions

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.440
that my company provides me.

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:20.820
This is the care that

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.940
I think is my company.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.300
Not only for me, but for my family as well.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.720
And accordingly, there is an inclusion

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:32.860
of both direct professional

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.380
activity and personal life, and

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.540
accordingly this is the care

01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:40.500
that is manifested about

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.020
me.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:45.520
A person usually never forgets and

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.240
changes these pleasant little things,

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.940
and these can really be little

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.040
things that he will not get

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.900
in another company.

01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:55.940
Yes, he may get a higher salary

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.800
there, but in particular he

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.220
can lose a lot in terms

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.520
of this social security

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.400
package, which is a very

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.860
powerful stimulating

01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:08.320
intangible factor.

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.660
As for the Russian specifics,

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.120
we will talk about it a little

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:16.500
later, but the social package is

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.860
for Russian companies the element

01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:25.000
that is gradually being introduced,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.580
but has not yet received

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.940
widespread spread.

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.540
However, more and more

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:34.320
companies are beginning to

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.980
understand its need,

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.580
but unfortunately not all

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.240
companies are able to invest

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.200
enough in the development

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.620
of this social package.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.740
This is, again, another problem related

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.640
to the national business specificity,

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.140
which we will talk about a

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.140
little later.
