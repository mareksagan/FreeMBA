00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I am a professor of the Russian Economic Academy named after Georgy Valentinovich Plokhanov,

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
where I teach MBA courses on management of personnel and management of organizations.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
I am also a consultant in the field of management of human resources.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
I have been working in the field of human resources for more than 20 years.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
The topic of our meeting today is the analysis of labor motivation,

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
the models of motivation, the methods of change, modification, improvement of motivation.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
And, of course, when we talk about motivation, we will focus on the main problems that arise in this system.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
If we talk about the problems of motivation, then this problem can be said to be old as a brick.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
What is motivation? If we do not go into various academic theories,

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
which, in principle, do not interest us, because the task that lies ahead of us is to master those practical skills

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
that will be interesting to us from the point of view of our functioning in business,

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
from the point of view of solving those business tasks that lie ahead of us.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Therefore, from the point of view of pragmatic assessment, pragmatic evaluation,

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
motivation is the reason for determining human behavior.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Why does a person make an effort to work?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Why does he work with enthusiasm or with a coolness?

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Why does a person stay late at work to get certain results,

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
regardless of whether he gets a salary or not?

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
And why does a person, who seems to be taking a position of authority,

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
having a good enough material compensation,

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
treat work with coolness and work does not arouse in him a rise, does not arouse in him an interest,

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
he stays late, he spends his time.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
How does a person's attitude to work occur? How does this attitude change?

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
After all, we all know that our motivation does not remain constant.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
If we come across some interesting business, some interesting problem,

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
then we are interested in it, we try to find different ways, approaches,

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
to get new knowledge in order to solve those tasks that lie ahead of us and achieve results.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
As we achieve these results, our interest in the task decreases.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
We already know how to solve it.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
It turns from new to routine, to usual.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
And we already know what and how to do.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
We know what difficulties will arise, when problems with reports will arise, and so on.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
And from this rise, from the initial one, with which we dealt with this problem,

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
we move on to a calm, or rather boring, time of work.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
The other side of the problem.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
We solve some task.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
For example, we have a goal to increase sales plans by 10-15% per month.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
We actively solve this task, but we are promised bonuses.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
We were hinted that if we cope with this task, then we will get a tele-business career,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
and we devote all our efforts to solving the problems that lie ahead of us.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
We look for opportunities, try to invent new schemes, new models, but it doesn't work.

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
We don't have a steady growth of sales, and, accordingly, we begin to understand

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
that in fact, at the end of the month, we will not be able to achieve the result we have set.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And again our motivation decreases.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
But in this case, it doesn't decrease because we have solved the problem,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
and, accordingly, we already know how and what to do.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
It decreases because we have let go.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
We realized that we will not be able to solve this problem.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
We have convinced ourselves that today is the middle of the month,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
and my sales growth is only 3%.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
And this means that we have signed our own defeat.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Therefore, we are losing our motivation.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
We are losing our reason for behavior.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
We have decided for ourselves that we will not be able to cope with the task.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
And therefore, we also begin to waste our working time,

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
having already understood that at the end of the month we will have to report why the task has not been solved.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
This is also a problem of motivation.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
How to achieve this situation?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
How to achieve this situation?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So that a person is not afraid to make a mistake.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
So that a person understands that if he solves a new task,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
it does not mean that he will definitely succeed.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
Here the old problem of my responsibility, delegation of responsibility,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
the problem of reporting the results,

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
the problem of finding the balance of freedom and dependence,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
the freedom of delegation of certain authorities.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
This is a huge and colossal issue that is related to motivation.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
And this is the issue that arises every day during our business.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
We can motivate ourselves.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
We want to go to work. We do not want to.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
We want to develop. We do not want to develop.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
From the point of view of the development of the company, the development of the business.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
We must motivate employees if we are the leaders, the owners of the business.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Because it is the employees who are the tool, the way

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
thanks to which we get the desired results for us.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
But it is very important to understand that it is not right for people,

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
for employees, for colleagues to look at the means of achieving their goals.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
People feel it very well.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
This is a colossal demotivating factor.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
The problem of managing human resources from the point of view of building a system of motivation

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
is also a very interesting problem that we will pay a lot of attention to today.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, of course, the basic term that interests us is what is labor motivation.

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
The fact is that motivation is a general concept related to the search for the reasons for human behavior.

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
But when we talk about commerce, about business, we are not interested in human behavior at all.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
This is an interesting academic topic that scientists can deal with.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
But we are interested in the specific reasons for human behavior when they carry out their labor activities,

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
their functional duties, which are related to the work that they do,

07:26.000 --> 07:35.000
the work for which they receive a reward, and the work that interests us, the work that we organize.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
Again, we will not argue about the nuances and subtleties of the term labor motivation.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
Because if we look at the literature, if we look at the basic, fundamental textbooks,

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
we will find different reviews and definitions in them.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
But since we are interested in the practical definition, the pragmatic definition,

08:02.000 --> 08:09.000
the definition that we can use in practice, let's understand the process of stimulation

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
of a single employee or the entire labor team, at least during our course,

08:16.000 --> 08:26.000
according to the labor motivation.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
Moreover, this process of stimulation is aimed at achieving specific goals that are before the organization.

08:35.000 --> 08:43.000
First, to achieve these goals, and secondly, to make productive decisions and planned plans.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
This is a general definition that includes a single employee,

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
the entire organization with all its characteristics, with all its features,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
with its psychological climate, which includes the final result.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
When we talk about business, we are primarily interested in the final result.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
We invest money and, as a result, we want to get a return.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
Therefore, we need the final result in terms of making decisions and achieving them,

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
and in terms of the goals, missions, tasks of the company we work for.

09:30.000 --> 09:41.000
These are the aspects that are considered, evaluated, and studied in different approaches to motivation.

09:42.000 --> 09:50.000
When we talk about motivation, it is always related to needs.

09:50.000 --> 10:00.000
As for needs, it should be noted that needs in business are understood in a slightly different way

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
than in psychology or in the academic environment.

10:03.000 --> 10:10.000
In psychology, and in general in life, needs are the need for a person in something.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
A person is missing something.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
He wants to eat, drink, relax, walk, enjoy.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Accordingly, he makes an effort to satisfy these needs.

10:22.000 --> 10:32.000
As for business, there is also a need for something, but this is a specific need.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
A need for achieving and getting a profit.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
A need to establish contractual relations with employees,

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
contractual relations with partners, with those people who are connected with us,

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
with whom we have a common rule of principle of work.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
As for needs, there are usually two types of needs.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Primary needs and secondary needs.

11:06.000 --> 11:18.000
As for primary needs, these are the needs that are necessary for a person to be able to work.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
For a person to work, he must be at least full.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
Because if you are sitting at work hungry, you will think not about doing your job,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
but about just satisfying your hunger.

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
If you are sitting at work, as it usually happens in summer,

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
it is very hot outside, and there are no air conditioners in the room,

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
then, accordingly, you are not thinking about working, but about what to breathe with.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
You are thinking about where to drink cold water.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
You are thinking about all the windows are open, but it is still impossible to work.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Therefore, the primary needs are, in fact, the creation of conditions necessary for work.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Yes, it is the satisfaction of the same physiological needs.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
In order for a person to start solving business tasks,

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
he must be satisfied with the necessary starting needs.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
Only after the satisfaction, the saturation of which, he will be able to start thinking about something else.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
This is about secondary needs.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
Because secondary needs are produced during life,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
during the acquisition of experience, knowledge.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
Accordingly, secondary needs are the needs to achieve goals,

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
to get a certain status, to grow in career, to grow financially,

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
to promote service, to get into the personnel reserve, and so on.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
Only after the primary needs are satisfied, we can talk about secondary needs.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
There are no miracles.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
If we want to get some result right away,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
you must first reach those parameters,

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
and then we will think about how to satisfy your initial needs.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
This is how this situation will not be solved.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
A person will never think about business results

13:34.000 --> 13:41.000
before he thinks about satisfying his desires, interests, and tasks.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
In principle, when we talk about work motivation,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
we can not give up on other terms and concepts.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
We will, as necessary, when we will consider different models,

13:54.000 --> 14:02.000
when we will study different ways of material motivation, non-material motivation,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
introduce additional, compatible concepts.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
But the basic concept is the concept of work motivation, primary and secondary needs.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
As for different concepts and theories of motivation,

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
we will focus on three basic concepts,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
because these concepts are really basic.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
If we consider a large number of different theories of motivation,

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
it turns out that all of them can be grouped into three main directions.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Let's be more precise.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
The most important of these three directions are the three main directions.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Because, of course, if we consider theories,

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
there are completely different criteria for their applicability and justification.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
The first theory of needs and, accordingly, the construction of motivation

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
is the hierarchical theory of needs proposed by Abraham Maslow.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
The first works appeared somewhere in 1943.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
What do I want to draw your attention to?

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
The concepts we are going to consider are still in the middle of the last century.

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
But this does not mean that these are good, dusty theories

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
that should be put into the archives.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
The concepts we are going to talk about are really basic theories

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
based on all modern ideas of self-learning organizations,

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
ideas of teaching organizations, ideas of system organizations,

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
ideas of structural organizations, ideas of virtual organizations.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
All these new trends that you will get to know during our course

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
are still based on these three basic concepts.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
And, accordingly, we should not consider that since these are concepts of the last century,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and, moreover, of its middle period,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
they are nothing more than academic interest.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
These are the concepts that really work

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
and that have proved their pragmatic significance over the past half century.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And we are interested in pragmatics.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
We are practitioners, we are not engaged in academic research.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
We do not write dissertations.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
We are interested in our business, our tasks.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
As for the theory of hierarchical needs of oil,

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
it is a very large, voluminous theory

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
that has many different nuances.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
But we will be interested in the following aspects.

16:54.000 --> 17:01.000
Oil highlights the so-called basic needs and meta-needs.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
In fact, we have already talked about this,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
the primary and secondary needs.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
So this definition, which we have already discussed,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
actually refers to oil.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Oil has just said that there are basic or vital needs.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
These are the needs for our life,

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
food, food, reproduction, clothing, housing.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
These are the needs that ensure the comfort of our existence.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
Until the basic needs are satisfied,

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
no other needs will be satisfied.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
The first thing a person does,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
which he does necessarily,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
which he does in any conditions,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
which he always does,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
is to satisfy his basic needs.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
This is normal.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
This is normal biologically,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
because basic needs ensure our physical survival.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
If we do not satisfy at least one basic need,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
we will have a threat to our life.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
And, of course, we will simply be unable to think about anything else.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
In addition to the basic needs,

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
which are the foundation of human existence,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
which are the fundamental reason for human behavior,

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
there are also the needs that are derived from them,

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
the needs that Maslow calls the metaprocesses.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
These are the needs for justice,

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
for prosperity, for the order of social life,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
for respect, for recognition.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
In fact, the oil pyramid,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
which you are naturally familiar with,

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
is a structure of needs,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
from the basic to the metaprocesses.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
The main idea that Maslow laid out

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
is that this pyramid of needs

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
is a system.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
And no higher need

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
can be achieved until the lower needs are satisfied.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
Human motivation does not allow for leaps.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
From this point of view,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
you can make a person work for free,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
but for this you need a threat,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
strength, a camp, a wire, and so on.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
This is all that we have seen in the history of the country,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
in Gulag, and so on.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Yes, people worked there for free,

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
but not because they had the appropriate motivation,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
they were afraid.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And in fact, this work was related to the fact

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
that in this way, driven into such conditions,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
they satisfied their basic needs.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
There was no mention of any metaprocesses,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
and since Maslow's concept was related to

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
a civilized foreign and Western business,

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
it was applied to people in a situation

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
where human value existed,

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
and where the approach of external pressure

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
that is applied to a person was not allowed.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
Maslow considered different types of these needs in his concept.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Deficit needs, motivation needs.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
But since the theory itself is not important to us now,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
but the ideas that found their expression,

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
we can focus on the basic and metaprocesses

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
in terms of understanding the system,

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
and in terms of understanding that this is a very important principle,

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
and that is why I am addressing your attention to it again and again,

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
that each underlying need can be achieved only after the previous one.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
And what else is very important that Maslow paid attention to,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
and not just paid attention,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
but really proved it,

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
and subsequently it was confirmed by a lot of people,

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
if you have your own pyramid of needs,

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
it doesn't mean that it will remain unchanged for the rest of your life.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
People are living beings.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
Their needs, goals, emotions, motives change.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
And a pyramid that was once built can crumble,

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
because external conditions change in it,

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
and these conditions change underlying needs, including the basic ones.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
Let's say you moved from the middle lane to the Arctic,

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
and there will be completely different conditions for satisfying your needs in warmth, in food,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
and other ways to achieve them.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
Therefore, until you learn to systematically satisfy your basic needs,

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
you will not think about metaprocesses,

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
about metamotives related to the achievement of certain business results.

22:38.000 --> 22:47.000
And this pyramid of needs changes throughout a person's life.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
It's not a static structure,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
it's a dynamic formation that is constantly supported,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
that is constantly moving,

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
and that is not set once and for all.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
This is also a very important idea,

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
which gives an answer to the question,

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
why is the motivation system built in the company once,

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
which proved its effectiveness in my company,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
which facilitated the growth of my company,

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
its expansion, the provision of new services, the development and expansion of production.

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
Why, suddenly, after 5, 6, 10, 15 years of the system's application,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
it suddenly began to fail?

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
For 10 years it proved its effectiveness, I don't want to change anything,

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
but now everything has changed.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
What happened?

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
The circumstances have changed.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
People who work in the company have changed.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
Their motives, their desires, their needs have changed.

24:00.000 --> 24:08.000
And this whole system has come out of control and requires modification.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
You don't have to be afraid to modify the needs that exist.

24:13.000 --> 24:20.000
Let's say, unification of needs is possible only after the end of life.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
While we are alive, our needs change.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
The next concept of motivation,

24:30.000 --> 24:38.000
which has a significant impact on understanding, vision,

24:38.000 --> 24:45.000
development of tasks that are in front of the business,

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
is the so-called two-factor motivation theory of Herzberg.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
You can meet it in different descriptions.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
It's a quote from his English name.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
And, as you understand, it's the same person.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
The basic ideas of this concept were formed in 1950.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
And, again, as for Herzberg,

25:19.000 --> 25:27.000
he was largely inspired by the ideas that were given to Maslow.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
Because the concept of Maslow was given almost 10 years earlier.

25:34.000 --> 25:43.000
And we can say that the ideas of Maslow quickly gained popularity,

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
and, of course, Herzberg was one of them.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
But, if the concept of Maslow was a psychological concept,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
because Maslow was a psychologist,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
and, accordingly, he was interested in the research of a person,

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
then Herzberg was engaged in the study and analysis of labor motivation,

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
the analysis of what motives drive a person's work,

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
what motives help a person achieve results,

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
and how to strive for motivation to not fall, but to constantly increase.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
Herzberg proposes two types of factors.

26:38.000 --> 26:46.000
He doesn't focus so much on human needs as on basic and metaprocesses.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
He doesn't start from a person, but from production, business,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
from the place where a person works.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Herzberg highlights the internal factors,

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
which are the content of a person's work.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
What does a person do?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Does he produce something?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Does he provide services?

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Does he support any other production?

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
And, from Herzberg's point of view,

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
the internal factors, i.e., my assessment, my experiences,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
my approach, my needs,

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
are what increase a person's satisfaction with his work.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
It is the person, my inner content, my mental characteristics,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
my subjective worldview,

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
that either brings me satisfaction or doesn't,

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
or the work I do, no matter why,

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
I like it and I want to go to work with pleasure,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I'm ready to stay at work,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
I'm ready to solve the tasks that arise before me,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I'm satisfied with this work.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
Or I do the necessary duties in order to live,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
I need money, in order to have money,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I need to be at work.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
So I came to work and I have to sit off my time from 9 to 6,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
with a lunch break and a snack.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm not satisfied with my work and I do my duties.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
This is the way that is present now in order for me to receive money.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Naturally, I'm not satisfied with the amount of money I receive.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I don't have internal satisfaction with my work.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
The internal factors that are present lead to negative motivation.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
Moreover, the internal factors, from the point of view of Gelsberg,

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
are the leading factors in terms of the satisfaction of the work

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
and in terms of achieving the results I want to achieve.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
And besides these internal factors,

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
what concerns these internal factors,

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
in fact, is a kind of an analogue of the needs of the masses.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
These are the needs of well-being, social order.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
What is it for a country with a labor?

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
I occupy a certain niche on the existing social ladder.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
This niche provides me with social well-being

29:31.000 --> 29:40.000
and I am satisfied with what I have achieved in life at the moment.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
The second type of factors that Gelsberg offers

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
are external or hygienic factors.

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
These are the conditions of work, salary,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
relationships between people in the group,

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
relationships between people in the labor collective where I work.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Conflicts, support,

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
do people stick sticks into each other's wheels or not?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
What is the policy of the company?

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
Is the employee considered as a means, as a screw for achieving the goal?

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Either the company pays great attention to the development of the growth of the staff,

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
gives the opportunity to learn, opens the prospects of career growth.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
The management style of the company is acceptable and pleasant to me.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
The company gives me an opportunity to develop,

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
to realize.

30:46.000 --> 30:55.000
These hygienic factors are those factors

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
that can reduce my dissatisfaction with the work.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
But this is a very important aspect

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
that was discovered by Gelsberg, formulated.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Today it has become the backbone of working with the staff.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Hygienic factors, salary increase,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
can reduce my dissatisfaction with the work.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
I understand that I have to spend 5 days a week,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
from 9 to 6, sitting at work,

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
but I understand that I sit to get a certain material reward.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
But even by reducing this dissatisfaction with the work,

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
hygienic factors cannot have a significant impact

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
on the increase in the productivity of the work.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
You can increase a person's salary,

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
but if a person is dissatisfied,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
then the work he does,

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
the team he works in,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
the management he has,

32:04.000 --> 32:10.000
will not put his soul into the work,

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
and the increase in the productivity will be perceived as due.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I do not be late for work, I hand in reports on time,

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
and I am paid for doing this better than others.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
But I am still dissatisfied.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
Gelsberg, in his two-factor theory of motivation,

32:32.000 --> 32:41.000
formulated the task of dissatisfaction with the work.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
Gelsberg formulated the situation

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
that the satisfaction with the work I do

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
is a function of the work content,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
what I do.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
And dissatisfaction with the work is a function of the work conditions.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
If I do not like the work conditions,

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
I am not satisfied with my work obligations,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
with what I do.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
Moreover, the content of the work itself

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
can be satisfactory for me.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
And here you need to find a balance.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
A balance between the internal factors of my satisfaction

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
and the external factors, hygienic factors,

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
which have an impact on my dissatisfaction with the work.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
In the end, I need two hours to get to work,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
and even through traffic jams.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
This means that I have to get up early.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
After work, I have to get home for a long time.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
This is all that is naturally unsatisfactory.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
No wonder, very often,

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
one of the points related to the reception of employees

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
and candidates to work is how much time is required

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
to get to work.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
If it is a very long time,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
then we can immediately say

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
that the candidate will have a dissatisfaction.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
Not immediately, but later.

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
If it takes more than 45 minutes to get to work,

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
this is the statistical data that was received by foreign researchers.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
They love statistics and everything is measured.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
This means that a person will not work effectively.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Half a day he will come to himself,

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
and half a day he will think that he will have to come back for a long time.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Therefore, as the research shows,

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
the time spent to get to work

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
should be up to 45 minutes.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
Again, these are ideal conditions

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
that one would like to have,

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
but it is not always possible.

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
So, the concept of Gersberg laid the foundations

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
for the analysis of business processes.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
In fact, it helped to translate the theory of oil

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
from a psychological point of view

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
to the application of labor motivation

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
to engineering or industrial organization psychology.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
The third concept that we will need for the future

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
is also a basic concept.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
This is the theory of motivation developed by McClelland.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
As for McClelland,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
it is the middle of the last century,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
even if it is the 1960s, it is still the middle.

35:57.000 --> 36:10.000
McClelland tried to solve the same question.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
What are the motivational needs

36:15.000 --> 36:27.000
that influence a person's work?

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
McClelland, having conducted a lot of experiments,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
a lot of observations,

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
and, of course, he did not work alone,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
he worked with a team of authors.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
In addition to the team of authors,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
he analyzed a lot of literature

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
and the experience of different successful companies,

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
different business representatives,

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
American, European, Eastern.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
McClelland came to the conclusion

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
that of all the abundance of needs,

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
primary, secondary, from the oil pyramid,

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Gersberg's needs,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
from all other theories,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
which are, I remind you,

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
thousand-page books describing the theory of motivation,

37:19.000 --> 37:27.000
if we really want to get a working pragmatic tool,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
then from all this abundance

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
we can highlight three basic needs,

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
which have a fundamental influence,

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
a fundamental influence on the work motivation,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
by influencing it,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
by influencing it,

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
by systematizing it,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
by intersecting with it,

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
we can achieve a significant change

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
in a person's motivational behavior.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
As for McClelland,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
he solved the practical problem.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
There are a lot of motives, a lot of needs.

38:04.000 --> 38:11.000
Where are the buttons that can be pressed

38:11.000 --> 38:17.000
to get the desired work results?

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
From McClelland's point of view,

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
and, accordingly, this point of view

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
has been repeatedly confirmed,

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
at least the fact that his concept

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
remains the basic one for a long time,

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
we can highlight three key needs.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
The first need is the need for achievement.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Achievement of results.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
In fact, this is an answer to the question

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
of how well I work,

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
how well, quickly, efficiently

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
I achieve the results I should achieve.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
Every person has a need for achievement.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
And as for a person,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
every person sets a certain level,

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
a certain level of demands,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
a certain level of demands,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
what I want to achieve,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
what I want to achieve.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
And, accordingly, this is a certain ideal.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
A young specialist, after the university,

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
came to work and he sets a task for himself.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
In three, five, six years,

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
he will become a department head,

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
an authority specialist,

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
a consultant, an assistant to the head.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
Depending on the structure that exists in his organization,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
he sets a certain level

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
that he clings to,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
that he wants to achieve.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
This is natural.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
Any person is so arranged that

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
before he starts doing something,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
he sets a goal.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
The goal is to satisfy

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
a particular need

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
to act within a particular motive.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
So, the employee has set a certain goal.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
These are the demands he clings to.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
And then the feedback is turned on.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
A person starts assessing

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
the achievements that he has.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
In fact, he assesses this delta

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
between the level of his demands

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
and the level of his achievements.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Three years have passed,

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
and I still remain a sales manager.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
I have not become a senior manager,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
a leading manager.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
Yes, I do well in the planned tasks

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
that I am given.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
But those employees who came with me

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
have already received a certain level of

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
personnel growth,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
have been included in the personnel reserve,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
are directed to certain training systems.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
And, of course, being in any organization,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
in any team,

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
you feel your value

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
and the value of the people around you.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
So, I compare the achievements

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
that I have with those of others

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
and, in fact, I give myself an assessment.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
Am I successful or not?

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
Can I really claim

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
the level I have set for myself?

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
Or will all this remain an overstatement?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
The need for achievements

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
is a very significant need.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
In fact, it is a need that forms

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
my satisfaction with work.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
If I achieve results,

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
then my satisfaction with work grows.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
I managed to find myself.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
And the fact that I spend most of my time

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
on work finds the results that I have.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
Accordingly, every person evaluates

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
the ratio of what I achieve,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
what I get,

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
since I spend time on work.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
The need for achievements

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
is really a very important need.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
It is important for all of us to know

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
what we are worth.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
And this is what Leiland describes.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
The second need,

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
which is a key button for work motivation,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
is the need for power.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
The need for power does not mean

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
that the power is political,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
although it can be.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
The need for power means

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
the ability to keep under control

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
the circumstances that I have to influence

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
and influence other people.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
People who work directly with me,

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
people who are under my command,

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
people who guide me

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
so that they give me a high rating

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
and understand that if I give

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
certain suggestions,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
they are justified and therefore

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
these suggestions can be fulfilled.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Power is like control.

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
I don't think that this need

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
will cause any disputes or questions.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
A person is simply arranged in such a way

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
that he wants to be the master of his behavior,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
the master of his position.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
And, of course, if we are talking about work,

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
about business, about work motivation,

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
then in this case I want to keep

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
under control the conditions of my work,

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
the conditions of my career growth,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
the conditions of my material stimulation,

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
the conditions of my social package.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
I want to keep them under control

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
and change the side that suits me,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
the side of increasing,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
the side of getting all the new benefits, etc.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Power is like control.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Control in any broad sense.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
In principle, power is the translation

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
of the English word power,

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
which is not familiar to our Russian mentality.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
Power is like a leadership of someone.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
Power is like control and influence on other people.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Influence from the point of view of manipulation.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Influence from the point of view of authority.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
But if I said something,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
I must know that it will be done.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
I must be sure that I was able to organize something

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
and this organization is based on control.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Control of those or other labor processes.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
And the third key need for a person

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
is the need for acceptance.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
This is the gift of nature to a person,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
first and foremost,

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
and secondly, this is the gift of the concept of oil.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
A person lives among other people

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
and among other people he is a social being.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
And in any case, my behavior, my actions,

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
my success, my failures, my achievements

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
are what I compare to what another person has.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
We do not work alone.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
We work in contact with different people.

46:12.000 --> 46:18.000
And any person needs to feel respect

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
from other people.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
I must be accepted by others.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
I must be authoritative to others.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
And others will turn to me for advice,

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
for consultation, for help.

46:34.000 --> 46:41.000
Accordingly, other people evaluate me as a professional,

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
evaluate me as a specialist.

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
And this, again, gives me a certain satisfaction.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
This is the realization of my metapotrebnosti,

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
the realization of my social value,

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
the realization of my place on the ladder of social hierarchy,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
and the realization of my authority.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
So, these are the three basic, key, button needs

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
that Mclellan sets out.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
Achievements, authority, acceptance.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
And then, depending on the connection between these needs,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
how these needs are realized,

47:29.000 --> 47:36.000
Mclellan solves the problem of efficiency of the manager,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
the efficiency of the labor motivation

47:39.000 --> 47:44.000
that should be there to achieve business results.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
Perhaps, the basic position,

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
which is supported, developed,

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
and based on Mclellan and his supporters' concepts,

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
is that if I consider managers,

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
then for efficient managers,

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
those who achieve results,

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
those who know how to organize their work,

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
who know how to organize the execution of certain actions,

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
the first place is for the need for achievement and authority,

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
and only then the need for acceptance arises.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Again, we can recall from our own experience

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
many successful managers, many successful business owners,

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
who first think about the need to keep everything under control,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
this is the first thing,

48:41.000 --> 48:47.000
and secondly, to take their business niche,

48:47.000 --> 48:53.000
to take a certain segment of the market,

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
and only after the satisfaction of these needs

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
another question arises.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
Well, how do they evaluate me now?

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
What kind of PR should I do

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
so that the attitude towards me from the employees,

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
from my colleagues, from the society

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
is more or less acceptable

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
so that it is socially significant in one way or another?

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
This is the theory of motivation of MacLeland.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Its beauty, its advantages,

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
is that it gives three characteristics

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
that can be controlled,

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
that can be influenced,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
that can be compared with each other

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
to get a certain direction

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
in the labor motivation that I want to realize.

49:56.000 --> 50:04.000
We are, as I said, based on these three basic concepts.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
All other concepts,

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
which are based in a large number in one way or another

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
on the concepts of Maslow, MacLeland, and Gersberg.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
And then, when we will look at specific examples,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
we will see it.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
The next question that we will consider today

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
will be related to the question

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
of how to improve the motivation of the labor.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
We have considered the basic concepts,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
talked about the approaches

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
that are being tried to direct to the right direction,

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
to the right direction of motivation of the employees.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
We will be interested in a specific question.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
How can we improve the motivation of the labor?

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
This problem has as many solutions

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
as the authors tried to deal with it.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Each manager, each manager,

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
each manager has his own vision,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
his own understanding.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
And this understanding depends on what he does,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
on his experience.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
It depends on the market sphere in which the company functions.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
And it is quite difficult to give some general recommendations.

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
However, you can try, based on the analysis of the literature,

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
based on the analysis of the effectiveness of the labor,

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
based on the effectiveness of the motivation system in different companies,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
to highlight those points that have a significant impact

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
on improving motivation.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
In fact, in this case, we have the same task

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
as we had before McClelland.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
To highlight from the abundance of factors of need

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
those key buttons that can be pressed

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
in order to get the motivation we want.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
As for the methods of motivation of the labor,

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
we can highlight five basic methods.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
I want to draw your attention to them again.

52:19.000 --> 52:26.000
In the literature, you can find 2, 3, 5, 105, 215, 315 methods.

52:26.000 --> 52:33.000
But since our goal is to structure these methods,

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
let's consider these approaches

52:36.000 --> 52:45.000
so that they can be applied in other conditions of work.

52:45.000 --> 52:51.000
The first method, which, I think, comes to everyone's mind,

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
is the most common, especially in the domestic environment,

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
and I would recommend it.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
It is a very powerful motive,

53:04.000 --> 53:13.000
especially for those employees who do not have enough experience for work,

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
who are looking for themselves.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
This is, of course, material stimulation of labor.

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
What does any employee who comes to work want?

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
He wants, let's recall Herzberg,

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
he wants his work to be interesting and satisfying.

53:34.000 --> 53:43.000
But the original motivator, which arises when I get a job,

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
is the question of what the material stimulation will be like,

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
what my salary will be like,

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
how it will grow, what the salary for the probation period will be like,

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
whether the annual system of reviews will be implemented,

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
and whether the increase in salary will be increased according to the results of the work.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
In the end, we work to earn money,

54:06.000 --> 54:14.000
because this way we can ensure the satisfaction of all our basic and meta-needs.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
Our economy, our economic relations, our society, our politics

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
are organized in such a way that everything revolves around the material means

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
that are necessary for obtaining material benefits.

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
I invest my time and effort into work,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
I produce something, but I need something else.

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
I get money for my work and I get everything I want,

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
or as much as I can get according to the results.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
The next way to get motivation for work

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
is to increase the quality and level of labor.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
This is a method that is very important for business.

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
Indeed, people work in companies,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
people are loyal to companies,

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
people have experience of being in a company,

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
they know the underwater stones that exist there,

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
they know the location of the company on the market,

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
in the end, they are the owners and carriers of corporate information, confidential information,

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
and, accordingly, the business owner is interested

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
so that this information does not go beyond the company.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Therefore, it is necessary to provide people, the staff,

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
with the opportunity to get their development within this company.

55:39.000 --> 55:44.000
That is, to organize a system of training and development of the staff.

55:44.000 --> 55:52.000
These are very important qualities that will be associated with motivation for work.

55:52.000 --> 55:59.000
If an employee sees that the company invests money in his training,

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
therefore, the employee feels that the company is interested in him working in it.

56:05.000 --> 56:12.000
And, again, in return, he will, based on the company's gratitude,

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
based on the fact that he sees his further place, his further work in this company,

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
strive to work better, strive to work better,

56:21.000 --> 56:27.000
and the funds that were invested in the construction of his training will be accumulated many times.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
In addition to training, the improvement of the quality of the workforce,

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
the improvement of the quality of the staff,

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
various programs for the development of the staff are facilitated.

56:39.000 --> 56:45.000
Indeed, the development of the staff involves the presence of a staff reserve,

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
the construction of a career path.

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
That is, a person should know what positions he can take in the company,

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
what requirements arise for each position.

57:00.000 --> 57:08.000
The company can have a grading system, a system of key efficiency indicators.

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
In the end, the employee should see the prospects that arise before him.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Again, let's remember that all motivation is the cause of behavior,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
and the cause of behavior requires goals.

57:20.000 --> 57:28.000
Today I work for a private position, today I get, let's say,

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
not as much money as I want to get.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I have two options.

57:33.000 --> 57:39.000
Either I can look for another job where I will be paid more,

57:39.000 --> 57:46.000
or I can strive to grow, develop inside the company,

57:46.000 --> 57:54.000
where I will get more, where my weight, my authority, my knowledge will gradually grow,

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
and, accordingly, where my social status will increase.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
In addition, if we talk about the quality of the workforce,

58:04.000 --> 58:09.000
then from the point of view of human resources management,

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
the task of assessing the staff arises.

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
How effectively does a person cope with the responsibilities imposed on him?

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
What competencies does he already have?

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
What competencies does he lack, and it is desirable for him to add them

58:28.000 --> 58:36.000
so that he becomes even more successful in the implementation of the functionality that he has.

58:36.000 --> 58:45.000
Accordingly, the assessment of the staff is the procedure that will allow the company,

58:45.000 --> 58:52.000
on the one hand, to understand whether it has enough human resources to solve its tasks,

58:52.000 --> 58:57.000
or whether it is necessary to go to the labor market and look for third-party specialists

58:57.000 --> 59:04.000
and lure them into the company to change the functioning of the staff and improve their work,

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
or I will not turn to the foreign market, but will grow specialists with my own efforts.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
As for domestic specifics,

59:14.000 --> 59:24.000
it is often said that companies are trying to buy over, lure the best specialists from the outside.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
However, this is a stick at two ends.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
Today you have lured, tomorrow you have this specialist, another company has lured.

59:32.000 --> 59:41.000
And, accordingly, these relations of buying and selling do not always give the desired result.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
Naturally, if we are talking about improving the quality of the workforce,

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
then again there is a problem of motivation.

59:50.000 --> 59:56.000
What motivation systems, what motivation schemes can be proposed

59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
so that a person A. is interested in working in this company,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
B. is interested in the development within this company,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
C. so that a person B. is loyal to the company,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
is a bearer of corporate ideas, values, culture, stereotypes,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and, accordingly, feels like a part of this company.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
The problem of improving the quality of the workforce is a very costly procedure,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
because both training, development, assessment, and introduction of new motivation schemes,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000
motivation schemes related to payments, material motivation, non-material motivation,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
all these require additional efforts, all these require calculation, analysis,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and, again, in this situation, it is not worth expecting a return right away.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
This is a very important point.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Often, managers, having good intentions related to increasing their business performance,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and ready to invest in the development of the staff,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.000
see that they do not receive the return they want in the period they want.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000
In this regard, they stop throwing money away from their point of view

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and move on to the good old traditional authoritarian methods of management.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
If you do not want to work, leave.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
We will find a person who will do the job for the same money, in the same place,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
as we need.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
This is, by the way, a clear specific, which, unfortunately, is very common.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
We will talk about this a little later today,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
when we will talk about the construction of different motivation systems in Russia.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:56.000
The next way to improve the motivation of the labor is to improve the organization of labor.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
This is directly related to the concepts of Herzberg, which we talked about.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
How to disperse the employees, how to organize the workplace,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.000
where to place the equipment, how to provide ventilation,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
how to arrange a workplace, how to open a relaxation room,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
so that the employee, upon coming to work,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
has an opportunity to recover his strength,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
relieve fatigue, and relieve stress.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Because we all understand that working in business is a constant stress,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
it is a constant functioning in conditions of lack of time,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
in conditions of lack of time.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It is a constant performance of different functions,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
when the same employee must prepare a different report to different departments,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
from different managers, but at the same time.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Accordingly, the time management problem is necessary,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
the organization of working time,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:10.000
the implementation of time management from the point of view of time management of the employee himself,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
the system of setting goals must be implemented in the right way.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It is not easy to say that at the end of the month you should increase the sales plan.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
This is an uncertain task.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
How much to increase? How to increase?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I increased the sales plan by 2%, and the manager meant 10%.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And, accordingly, there is a misunderstanding.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
And here is not so much the fault of the manager,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
but the goals set inadequately.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Accordingly, when we talk about the improvement of the organization of work,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
it is a problem of building a management vertical,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
it is a problem of building a relationship at the horizontal level,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:03.000
it is a problem of assessing the success of the functioning of one or another employee,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
the success of the process of communication of this employee with other employees,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and, again, from the point of view of the compliance of the employee with the position.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:25.000
The next way to improve motivation is to involve the staff in the management process.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
For the Russian tradition, this is a relatively new approach,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
which has not yet found a fairly wide spread.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But for the Western business, this process has been implemented for a long time.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Because if a person is involved in the management process of a business,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
it does not matter what level it is.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Is it the level of the organization of the department's work?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Is it the level of the organization of the work of two managers nearby?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Is it the level of the organization of the company's management in general?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
The construction of a system of relations and crossings within different departments?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The main thing is that a person begins to feel the need of the company,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
and a person begins to believe that he is not a common pawn in this company,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
that he is considered to be one, his opinion is asked, he is respected.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.000
As they say, let a person have faith in his needs.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Remember, we talked about the need for recognition of MacLeland.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And this faith in needs is a very strong guiding motive

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
for which a person will invest, for which a person will strive to make

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000
certain achievements that he would not have done in ordinary conditions,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
no matter how much you raise his salary,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
no matter what more profitable offers you offer him.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:16.000
People are so arranged that they need not only to feel their importance,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000
but also to see that they are valued,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
that they should consider that they are in their place,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and only then will they hold on to this place.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:37.000
The next point, which is related to the improvement of the motivation of labor,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
is non-money stimulation.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Or what is called non-material stimulation of labor.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
This type of stimulation begins to get its spread and development

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
in those conditions, in those cases when the business is already sufficiently developed,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
when the business is already sufficiently stable,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
when the company has a certain place in the market,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000
when the company has a certain prehistory, certain traditions,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
when the company has a certain brand.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
The brand itself is already a very interesting non-material way of stimulation.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
When the staff is ready to come to the company for a lower salary,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
for more work than in another, but this is a brand company,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and the neighboring companies are just beginning to develop,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
and, accordingly, have not yet managed to gain authority.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The system of non-material stimulation has not yet received widespread spread in Russia,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
although large companies that exist in Russia,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
mostly foreign capital companies,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:10.000
provide a large block of non-material stimulation in the compensation package,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
which is very attractive and interesting for the staff,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
which we will talk about a little later.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So, look, here are the main five directions

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000
that are currently being used to improve the motivation of the labor.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Again, I want to say, you can argue with some of them,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
that this direction will not work, this direction is not so important.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.000
These directions do not mean that each of them should be applied to your company,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and that each of them will earn in your company.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Again, it is necessary to remember.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
This is what is the accumulation of world business experience.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
But, any company has its own specifics,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and, accordingly, you can take what is more accessible in your company,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
corresponds to its position on the market,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
corresponds to its rating, corresponds to its quotations,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.000
corresponds, in the end, to the financial and economic indicators that the company has.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Again, you can ask, why there are no other ways of motivation of the labor,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
for example, related to foreign business trips,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
with the provision of loans for apartments, and so on.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
These are the details that we will talk about.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I would just like to outline the main paths and goals.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And the specific content will depend on the functions and tasks

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
that arise in your activities.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:59.000
So, perhaps now let's turn to such a problem as material and non-material stimulation.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
As for these two approaches, on the one hand,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:12.000
the most obvious, the most understandable, the easiest to perceive ways of stimulating labor,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
which either help motivate employees and staff,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000
or, on the contrary, build a line of demotivation

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.000
and, accordingly, prevent the implementation of the economic indicators that the company has.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000
What methods of material stimulation are usually used?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000
The simplest is, of course, the method of material stimulation based on the results of the work.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
The worker performs a plan, and, accordingly,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
he receives a certain amount of material reward for the execution of this plan.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
This reward is usually divided into two parts.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
There is a certain fixed part that the employee will receive in any case.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Let's say, this is the part that pays for the hospital,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
this is the part that pays for the period of absence of the employee at work,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and this is the part that is paid to the employee only for sitting down his working time

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.000
from 9 to 6, from 10 to 7, depending on the internal work order.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
At the same time, there is a bonus or variable part of the payment,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:42.000
which is paid to the employee based on the results of his personal direct work during the month,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:50.000
on the increase in the volume of sales, on the expansion of the market of services that he offers,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
on the increase in the number of clients that he brings to the company.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That is, if the fixed part is what you are paid for the fact of your presence at work,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:12.000
then the variable part is what is reflected in your contribution, in your labor motivation.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:22.000
If you want to earn more, show more activity, spend more time promoting services,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
signing contracts, looking for clients, you will receive more.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:41.000
This is a very good, moving motive that is effective from the beginning of the employee's work.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
While I am in business, while I am gaining experience,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:53.000
and again, it should be said that the systems of this material variable part are different.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:01.000
There are progressive systems, depending on the fact that the more results you achieve,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
the more variable part you get.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
There are regressive systems.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:17.000
The fact is that, in the end, any company is interested in making a profit

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
and letting it not only for the salary, but for the expansion of production,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000
for the change of equipment, for the inclusion of different telecommunication systems, and so on.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And, accordingly, you need to find a balance,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
to stimulate the employee on the one hand,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
but on the other hand, to keep the funds for the direct development of the business.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:51.000
There are many different systems of variable motivation,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and we will talk about it a little later, when we will touch on the motivation system in Russian terms.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And again, in the literature that I have suggested to you,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
there are many different schemes of building material,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
precisely material stimulation, which we are talking about.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
In addition to this material stimulation, there is a system of bonuses.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:26.000
These bonuses can be one-time, really, for some outstanding results,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
for solving any problems.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Or periodically, when an employee, while fulfilling his functions,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:43.000
successfully performing them, receives an additional payment for his work,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
on the condition of the implementation of the plan.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Different tasks can be solved by this scheme of bonuses.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
In fact, it is necessary to keep the employee in tune,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
because you will always get the fixed part, and this is the additional part.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
If you work successfully, you will receive these bonuses.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
But there are different circumstances.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And if suddenly the efficiency of your work began to fall systematically,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000
then the question arises about the expediency of paying you this constant bonus.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And as for the bonus system of labor,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000
it is often prescribed in the labor contract, which is signed by the employee.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And this is what the employee can claim,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
because these are the expectations he receives from the work,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
which is signed in his labor contract.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
But in addition to this, there are also so-called stimulating payments,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
which are implemented by the management at their discretion.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The management can encourage the employee for the result.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
The management can encourage the employee for the future,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:16.000
so that he feels that he is not some part of the gray mass,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000
but that the manager is watching his success, his achievements,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.000
that he can get assistance from his more successful, more experienced colleagues,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and, accordingly, so that he is not afraid to experiment.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
We all understand that while we are gaining experience, we can make mistakes,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
we can get certain results.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And in order to support the positive aspects of the employee's work,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000
his functioning, his initiative, his desire to take on additional responsibility,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000
all this can be stimulated at once, at the discretion of the management.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Someone can get it, someone may not.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Again, the way of building this free stimulation depends on the policy

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
in the management of human resources, which is implemented in the company,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
which exists in a company.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And this system of stimulation significantly forms a favorable psychological climate

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000
for the work in the team, it forms the desire of the staff to stay in this company,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and not to look for another company.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Still, as for material stimulation, this is a relatively well-developed topic.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:59.000
There are different schemes for building a material stimulus system,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
bonuses and compensations.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I would like to focus on non-material stimulation or on the formation of a compensation package.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Its other name, which may be more familiar and common,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
is a social package provided by the company to its employees.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
When we come to work, to get a job,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
a person understands that in addition to material stimulation,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
he can get something else at this job.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Some additional social package, additional services,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
additional opportunities that the company provides to its employees

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:57.000
depending on the results of their work, their time, their contribution to the company's achievements.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
The social package in different companies is different.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Again, the problem is that the social package is still a certain part of the company's profit,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
which is used for development.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Accordingly, these are some additional services,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
some additional opportunities that the company provides to its employees.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Not in the current natural equivalent,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
but from the point of view of additional services and opportunities

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:38.000
that you can use until you become an employee of this particular company.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
What elements are usually included in the social package?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Very often medical insurance is used for employees and members of their families.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Again, the scheme can be different.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It can be full medical insurance payment.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It can be discounts on medical insurance payment.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:07.000
The employee has the opportunity to choose different medical service schemes.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Depending on the term of your work in the company,

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
depending on your status in the company,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000
depending on the bets that the management makes on you,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:29.000
you can get different schemes for increasing or decreasing direction.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Moreover, these schemes can be provided not only to you,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
but also to members of your family.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
This is a very important motivating factor.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You may be dissatisfied with the amount of salary that you get.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000
But on the other hand, you understand that by working in this company,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
you have the opportunity to be served in good medical centers,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
with significant discounts.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:11.000
In fact, this non-material stimulation is an addition to the material package.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
If you pay less, you get more from the salary that you get.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:25.000
A very important component of the social and compensation package

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
is the opportunity to train professional development.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I think you all agree that good education,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000
good educational service providers,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
where you can get the required skills,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
the developed skills, are expensive.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
The company is naturally interested in the fact that

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
its employees are professional and competent.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And, of course, these employees are the ones that the recruitment company is looking for.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
But on the other hand, we have already talked about this,

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
business is constantly changing,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
new circumstances and conditions are constantly emerging,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
legislative documents are changing,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
and all these changes need to be monitored.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Therefore, the company can pay its employees both individual training

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
and organizational training for the whole organization.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
This is called organizational training,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000
which is getting more and more widespread today.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000
As for training, it is a rather expensive item in the budget of the organization.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And this expensive item can often not lead to the desired result,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:07.000
and, accordingly, the money spent will not always pay off as quickly as the management wants.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:19.000
On the other hand, this expense item can lead to a rather serious and significant growth of business results

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000
that the company has, significantly improve its competitive ability,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
significantly stabilize its position in the market,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
correspond to the expansion and greater coverage of market segments.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000
As for training and development, we have already talked about this today.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And again, the main thing here is that the employee understands

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
that if the company invests money in its training,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
then the company is interested in it staying.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Naturally, it makes no sense to train an employee so that he goes to competitors after that

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
and uses professional skills.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.000
The management system of human resources is aimed at

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:23.000
creating a loyalty of the staff to many non-material, but social components that we are talking about now.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Many companies, again, practice a variety of compensations.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
For example, for lunch.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
As for work, we spend 9-10 hours at work,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.000
and, again, we must meet our basic needs.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
The basic needs in food.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Very often it turns out that lunch time is provided,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
and what will you do at this time?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Will you work? Will you smoke? Will you go out to eat?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
This is already given to the staff.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And very often it turns out that people use this time not for food,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
but for rest, to solve their own problems,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
to go somewhere, to do some other things.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:32.000
If the company is interested in having staff who can really work,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:40.000
it can organize lunches, both for the company and for the employees,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and compensate the cost of these lunches completely or partially.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.000
In addition to lunches, we can talk about the provision of a service car.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Again, we understand that we are talking about those managers or employees of the level

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000
to which the car is really a necessary element

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
in terms of performing their service duties.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
In order to be able to go to the appropriate organization, tax inspection,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000
and quickly or on time solve certain problems.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.000
In order to have the opportunity to get to the partners with whom we work,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
to quickly transfer the necessary documents.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Another element can be the provision of payment for mobile communication,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
because mobile phones are not a luxury anymore,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
but a necessary element of our everyday activities,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
a necessary element of effective functioning.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And, of course, since it is a tool for work,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
which the employee uses to solve the functional tasks in front of him,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.000
then, again, you can compensate for the payment of mobile communication.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
So, as for a variety of compensations for lunches,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
for mobile communication, for payment of a phone, and so on,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
this is another element of non-material stimulation,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:25.000
because it indicates that the company is interested in the employee.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And, of course, there is nothing surprising or bad about it.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:36.000
These are the additional opportunities that the employee can use in his interests.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
We are all living people, and we should not dream of perfect employees

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
who will talk exclusively about work on a mobile phone.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:53.000
If this happens, then it can cause some surprise

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
whether there are any other problems hidden here.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
A very important aspect in terms of non-material stimulation

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
is the construction of a system of non-state pension.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000
We all know that the pension system of state pension funds,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:22.000
the pension that is provided after retirement,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:30.000
is so insignificant, 3-5 thousand rubles, that you cannot live on it.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Especially if you are used to living on completely expensive amounts.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000
That is why, in Russia, in the West, of course,

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
it has a long history, non-state pension funds are being formed,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.000
where the company additionally invests the material resources,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:00.000
which will later be used to compensate the person

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
for the termination of his work.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And this is a very important aspect.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Because the company binds the employee to itself for a long time.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000
In order to get a pension, you need to work in the company for 5-10-15 years.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Depending on how long you worked, you will get the corresponding pension.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Therefore, there is a very important motivating factor

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:38.000
that binds a person to the company he works in.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And then, while working in this company,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
there may be various discontent, various displeasures.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:59.000
But the fact that you have 2-3-4-5 years left to work to get a non-state pension

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000
can be a very strong, very powerful, very powerful motivating factor

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.000
that will ensure the functioning of a person,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and the functioning of a person should be professional, adequate,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
responsible at his workplace.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Because you know, depending on how successful you are in solving any problem,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000
it will determine the dividends that you will get in the end,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
or what you will lose.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
These are not material factors.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
This is not what you get now in the amount of your salary.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
This is what you can get later.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.000
But people are so organized that they don't live in the present day.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Whatever we say, we think about the future.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
We think about what will happen tomorrow,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
what will happen if we suddenly get sick,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
if we suddenly can't run and spin like a squirrel in a wheel,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
as we do now,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
if our loved ones suddenly get sick.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
We live in the world, we are living people,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
and there is nothing to be afraid of.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And in this regard, the fact of getting a decent enough compensation

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000
can be a motivating factor

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:40.000
that can even compensate for the dissatisfaction in the salary you get now.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
This system of non-state pension insurance

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
can be implemented in stable economic conditions,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
and it can be implemented in large companies.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Because the deductions in the pension fund,

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
which we are talking about now,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
are quite substantial additional deductions

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
that a company can take from its profits

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
and take from the prospects of its further development.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000
At the same time, a social package can be included

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
in the partial payment of the trips to the resort,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
both for employees and for members of their families.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
A good vacation is not cheap,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000
and in this regard, if a company pays or compensates

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
a part of the amount for a trip,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.000
it is a very important motivating factor.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Let it be 20%, let it be 10%.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
But this is the situation when the fact is important,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
not the amount.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Because the employee will remember

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000
that the company invested in my vacation,

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
in addition to the vacation I got on hand.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And, therefore, I am interested in working in this company,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
because it is not a fact that the company

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
that promises me more money,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
where they promise me less employment,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
will be able to provide me with the social package

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
that they provide me with as carefully as possible.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
There are many other pleasant details

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
that companies can include in the social package.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Payment of fitness clubs, pools, gyms,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000
various corporate events,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.000
which for the company are a large amount,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
but on the other hand, they contribute to the development

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
of this single corporate spirit,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
contribute to the unity of the team,

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000
contribute to the formation of loyalty in the team

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
and contribute to the formation of a sense of community.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
This is my company.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
These are the conditions that my company provides me with.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
This is the care that my company provides me with,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
not only for me, but also for my family.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And, accordingly, there is an inclusion

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000
of both professional activity and personal life.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And, accordingly, this is the care that is shown in me.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
A person usually never forgets

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
and does not exchange these pleasant little things,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
and these can really be little things,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
which he will not receive in another company.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Yes, he can get a higher salary there,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
but, among other things, he can lose a lot

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
in terms of this social package,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
which is a very powerful stimulating non-material factor.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
As for the Russian specifics,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
we will talk about this a little later,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:20.000
the social package is still an element

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000
that is gradually being introduced,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
but has not yet been widely spread.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
However, more and more companies

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
are beginning to understand its need.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Unfortunately, not all companies are able

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000
to invest sufficient funds

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
in the development of this social package.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
This is another problem

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000
related to the national business specifics,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
which we will talk about a little later.
