00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.440
Good morning to all who are interested

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.680
in our course.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.120
My name is Dmitry Barsukov.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.740
I am a coach and business consultant

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.680
and I am dealing with

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.480
organizational development

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.200
issues and some legal aspects of

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.600
entrepreneurial activities.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.700
Our course is called “Legal

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.020
Foundations of Entrepreneurship”

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.300
and focuses on the main key

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.120
points of creating enterprises.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.420
It does not claim to be a depth

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.140
or width of coverage and is

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.380
intended, first of all,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.340
to help entrepreneurs to navigate

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.440
in the jungles of Russian

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600
laws governing business activities.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.440
Therefore, preparing it, I tried

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.280
to look at entrepreneurial activities,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.600
the legal issues of entrepreneurial

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.560
activities through the eyes

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.920
of a simple citizen who

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.460
decided to start his business.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.320
So what is entrepreneurship?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.320
The Civil Code gives a clear

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.780
and simple definition

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460
of business activity.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.920
Entrepreneurial activity is independent,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.660
carried out at your own

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.680
risk and risk, aimed at systematic

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.260
earning profits from

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.580
the use of property, the sale

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.000
of goods, the performance of works,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.980
the provision of services

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.640
by persons registered

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.420
in this capacity in

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.780
the established legal order.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.840
What laws govern

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.160
business?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.780
Let us list them briefly.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.420
This is the Civil Code, first

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.240
of all, the Tax Code, the Law on

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.440
the Limited Liability Company,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.020
the Law on Both Joint Stock

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.440
Companies, the Law on Non-

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.720
Profit Organizations, the Law

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.940
on Licensing, the Customs

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.920
Code and some other laws that

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.920
are usually used less often

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.700
in business activities.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.160
Participants in the relations

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.460
regulated by the Civil

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.980
Code legislation are

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.920
citizens and legal entities.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.500
The rules established

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.960
for legal entities in

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.440
the part concerning business

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.640
activities also

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.440
apply to natural persons.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.120
Even if you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.120
are not registered

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.180
as an entrepreneur,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.580
but do this, you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.020
are subject

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.760
to all relevant laws.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.200
Citizens have the right to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.600
engage in entrepreneurial activities

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.300
without forming a legal entity

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.460
from the moment of state

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.820
registration as an

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.240
individual entrepreneur.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.800
In addition, there are such forms

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.400
of entrepreneurial activity that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.340
are issued in the form of registration

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.360
of a legal entity, this is LLC,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.720
LLC and so on.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.100
And engaging in business activities,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.220
that is, these organizations

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.980
can start working from the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.080
moment of state registration.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.940
Let us consider the types

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.320
of organizational and legal forms

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.900
that are convenient for the implementation

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.420
of business activities.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.700
This is, as we have said,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.580
an individual entrepreneur.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.980
The second form, the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.820
most common and the simplest

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.780
after the individual

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.240
entrepreneur, is a society

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.860
bounded by responsibility.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.780
There are also closed joint-stock

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.120
companies and various non-

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.320
profit organizations.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.080
What are the advantages

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.760
of an individual entrepreneur?

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.180
First of all, it is easy to register.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.380
The minimum state duty is 400 rubles,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.180
some notarial expenses, the period

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.740
of registration is 5 working days,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.340
the minimum set of documents,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.160
certificates of registration

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.000
and certificates of the right to apply

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.280
one or another type of taxation

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.460
if necessary.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.680
In the certificate of registration

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.120
is recorded only the name

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.420
of the entrepreneur.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.020
No names are allowed.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.960
Previously, this was possible,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.680
but today as the name of

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.400
your company will only appear

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.200
the name of their fatherland.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.380
The printing only shows

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.400
their name.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.040
The legal address

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.140
of the entrepreneur is his

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.780
home address.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.280
What other points should be

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.700
noted in relation to the convenience

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.360
of using such an organizational

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.980
and legal form as an individual entrepreneur?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.440
First of all, this is convenient not

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.360
only in the registration, but also

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.280
in the liquidation of an individual entrepreneur.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.080
In Russia, as in the rest of the

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.020
world, it is much easier to register

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.340
a company than to liquidate it.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.960
In the case of an individual

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.800
entrepreneur, this procedure is

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.160
easier than in the case

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.020
of legal entities.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.380
If the entrepreneur decides that he

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.800
no longer wants to engage in his activity

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.600
and wants to close his business, then

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.540
he, first of all, needs to pay all

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.200
taxes, write to the tax inspectorate

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.760
the appropriate statement and

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.060
file it, or about the suspension

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.040
of activities, which

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.920
is also possible, or about

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.500
liquidation.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.280
If the tax inspectors have no claims

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.400
to you on payment of taxes and there

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.780
is no reason to check you

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.540
seriously, then this procedure

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.280
for suspension of activity

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.040
or liquidation is actually completed.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.260
In the event of liquidation, you

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.020
will be issued a certificate.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.720
An individual entrepreneur

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.740
can use several forms of taxation

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.720
and reporting.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.500
This is standard taxation, a simplified

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.900
system, a patent and a single

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.020
tax on the intended income.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.700
What taxes do entrepreneurs

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.240
pay in the case of standard taxation?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.740
This is 13% of the amount

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.120
of income, reduced

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.240
by the amounts of the deductions,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.220
value added tax, 10% or 18%.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.600
10% is the VAT rate that is

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.880
usually applied to foodstuffs

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.760
and some other groups

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.900
of goods.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.220
This is described in Article 145

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.380
of the Tax Code.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.840
The single social tax on the income

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.440
of the entrepreneur minus the income

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.120
of 100 and below according

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.360
to the scale provided by the tax code.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.220
And 26% of the single social tax from

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.480
the salary fund, if the

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.420
entrepreneur employs employees.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.960
These are also some other taxes due

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.560
to the specifics of the

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.900
activity of a particular entrepreneur.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.020
Customs payments, excise duties,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.040
mineral tax, if you suddenly

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.220
decide to mine such,

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:01.160
and some other taxes.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.420
But, as a rule, individual entrepreneurs

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.580
rarely carry out such a

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.960
complex activity.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.520
Individual entrepreneurs keep

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.820
records of income and expenses

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.140
in the manner established by the

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.200
tax legislation and the law

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.300
on accounting.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.440
The procedure for accounting of income and

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.400
expenses and economic operations

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.300
for individual entrepreneurs is provided

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.400
by the order of the Ministry of Finance,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.740
and taxes are accounted for by the accounting

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.820
book of income and expenses

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.180
of economic operations

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.420
of the individual entrepreneur.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.080
This procedure does not apply

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.300
to the income of an individual

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.880
entrepreneur if he

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.620
uses a simplified tax system.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.920
Today, entrepreneurs

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.260
rarely use such a

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.920
standard tax system.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.800
A much more common

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.240
taxation and patents system.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.580


00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.260
What is a simplified tax system?

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:14.040
It includes two types of taxation.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.740
The first is 6% of the income that

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.760
the entrepreneur receives in the form

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.100
of gross income.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.020
Such a system of taxation is

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.120
convenient for those entrepreneurs

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.880
who carry out activities that

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.080
do not involve large

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.620
significant costs.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.980
These are services, as a

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.660
rule, and some other activities.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.220
The second form of taxation in the

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.380
simplified system is 15% of the difference

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.480
between income and expenses.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.700
This form of taxation is convenient

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.120
in trade and production, where

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.680
costs are large and constant.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.380
It is necessary to keep in mind that

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.400
the expenditure articles, clearly regulated

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.560
by the tax code and the tax inspection,

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.720
are treated to them quite

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.580
strictly.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.600
Therefore, when you introduce

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.020
your activity, you need to clearly

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.780
document all your expenses

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.080
so that you do not have any

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.560
disagreements with the tax inspectorate.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.520
If you hire employees, you must

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.360
pay 10% in pensions, savings

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.720
and insurance contributions

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.740
from the salary fund and

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:45.060
0.2% from the salary fund for

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.440
injury.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.760
If an individual entrepreneur

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.200
does not have any employees,

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:54.000
the persons born in 1966 and

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.460
older are obliged to pay a fixed 100

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.560
rubles for the insurance

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.100
part of the pension.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.220
Persons born in 1967 and younger are

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.420
obliged to pay the same 100 rubles

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.660
and 50 rubles on the cumulative

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.840
part of the pension.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.660
In addition, an individual entrepreneur

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.160
under a contract with a pension

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.160
fund can voluntarily

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.880
increase these amounts of deductions.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.360
In order to use the simplified

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.740
tax system, you must

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.840
submit the relevant

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.920
application when registering

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.040
you as an individual

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.420
entrepreneur.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.180
If you have already carried out some

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.540
activity and decided to move to the

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.900
simplified system, then you are

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.280
obliged to file a application

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.300
to the tax inspectorate from October

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.800
1 to November 30 of the previous year,

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.520
in which you want to carry out

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.100
your activities under the simplified

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.640
taxation system.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.560
Income of the taxpayer,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.240
switching to the simplified

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.720
system, should not exceed

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.100
15 million rubles, multiplied

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.800
by the corresponding

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.240
coefficients, which

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.460
are established

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.320
by the government.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.860
The simplified system of taxation

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.000
of organizations, the

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.360
residual value of funds and non-

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.240
material assets exceeds

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.540
100 million rubles, as well as

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.860
taxpayers listed in Article

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.200
246 of the Tax Code of the Russian

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.420
Federation, shall not

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.600
be applied.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.820
In the current year, the income

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.640
of the taxpayer should not

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.640
exceed 20 million rubles.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.580
In the event of exceeding this amount

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.220
or if the residual value of the assets

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.060
and non-material assets exceeds 100

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.120
million rubles and the average

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.580
number of employees exceeds 100

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.400
persons, the taxpayer

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.060
is considered to have moved

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.820
to the general tax regime

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.960
from the beginning of the

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.820
quarter in which this excess

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.880
was allowed.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.440
Another form of taxation of

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.880
individual entrepreneurs

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.120
is patent.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.980
It is used widely and can

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.280
only be used by individual

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.160
entrepreneurs.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.600
If the simplified system can be

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.900
applied by individual entrepreneurs

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.760
and other legal entities,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.500
then the patent is only applied

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.900
by individual entrepreneurs.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.220
A patent is a fixed tax determined

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.080
by federal laws and laws of the

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.980
constituent entities of the Russian

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.900
Federation on certain

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.760
types of activities of an

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.980
individual entrepreneur.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.920
The cost of a patent is calculated by the

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.680
tax authorities according to

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.800
the scale established by the laws.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.980
In the case of the application

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.560
of the simplified taxation system

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.680
by entrepreneurs based on a patent,

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.620
they are subject to the norms established

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.020
by citizens with the Tax

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.580
Code of the Russian Federation.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.600
The individual entrepreneur

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.880
should not attract employees.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.580
The patent is convenient

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.860
because the entrepreneur

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.200
can predict the amount of tax deductions.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.360
He declares to the tax inspectorate the

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.940
estimated amounts of income, and the

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.440
tax inspectorate calculates the value

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.780
of the patent on the basis of

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.180
his assumptions.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.080
Single income tax is another

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.440
form of taxation

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.460
that can be used by both

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.960
individual entrepreneurs

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.960
and legal entities.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.420
It is mandatory for certain types

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.640
of activities and is introduced

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.020
with the subjects of the Russian Federation.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.820
Until now, this system is not implemented

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.180
in all subjects of the

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.260
Russian Federation.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.440
In Moscow, a single tax on the income

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.580
is not introduced.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.080
In the Moscow region there

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.280
are separate types of activities

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.700
that can be carried out and

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.080
taxed on the basis of a single

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.620
tax on income.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.460
In many Russian subjects this

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.480
type of taxation was also not

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.300
introduced.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.840
And most importantly, what I would

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.300
like to note in the activity

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.260
of an individual entrepreneur, what

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.500
is its great advantage.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.000
An individual entrepreneur, having

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.420
paid the imposed taxes, the

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.260
remaining profit with a calm

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.400
soul can put itself in the pocket

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.620
as his legal income.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.860
No more to pay anyone.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.020
He can do this arbitrarily, on time,

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.660
the most important thing is that the

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.600
money remains on the tax.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.440
At the same time, the participants

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.700
of the company, shareholders of the joint-

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.820
stock company and participants

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.340
of other types of business activities,

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.880
having received their dividends

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:31.020
after payment of 8% income tax.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.400
Compare, an entrepreneur pays

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.040
13% on income tax under the

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.700
standard tax system,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.540
and an enterprise, a legal

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.140
entity, pays 24% on the income

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.060
tax of enterprises.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.520
The difference is substantial.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.700
Also compare 6% of income or 15% of

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.020
the difference between income

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.160
and expenses with the simplified

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:06.860
tax system and 6 -9% of the balance.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.000
Also called feel the difference.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.240
It is much more convenient to

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:19.120
get your income without thinking about

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.500
any risks, consequences, than

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:27.320
in some ways to draw profits,

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.300
like minimizing your expenses.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.320
This is a significant advantage

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.360
of such a form of business

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.100
activity as an individual entrepreneur.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.800
However, individual entrepreneurs

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.240
have some disadvantages.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.860
This is primarily liability,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.640
VAT deductions and the status

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.700
of an individual entrepreneur.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.520
Responsibility of the

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.880
individual entrepreneur.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.800
The individual entrepreneur is

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.220
liable for all his obligations to

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.480
all the property belonging to him.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.400
That is, if you have collected loans,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.400
collected goods and somehow your activities

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.440
have not worked out, and you have

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.960
understood that you will have to

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.360
close your business, then if

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.920
you cannot pay for your obligations,

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.560
then in court, the judicial

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.700
authorities have the right

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.960
to describe your property.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.840
There are some exceptions,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.560
some optimistic notes.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.900
It is that you are not

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.200
subject to recovery of

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.260
property that is vital

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.880
and without which you can

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.040
not do.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.960
This is the only housing if you do

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.360
not have a second apartment,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.560
and the car necessary for

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.200
moving if you do not have a

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:08.340
second, and up to some products,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.800
the minimum of products that

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.000
are necessary for your life activity.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.880
They cannot be reimbursed.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.720
At the same time, it is necessary to

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.700
keep in mind that the property acquired

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.540
by the spouses in the joint

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.480
life is joint property.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.560
And if you are registered

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.500
as an individual entrepreneur

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.340
and you are being fined,

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:37.180
then it will be imposed and

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:42.480
on all your property your

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:48.780
second spouse is not an

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.540
individual entrepreneur.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.880
The second feature of

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.240
the relationship of the individual

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.540
entrepreneur with contractors and

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.800
partners is VAT deduction.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.740
What is the essence here?

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.520
The fact is that most of

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.340
the time individual entrepreneurs

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.780
are not VAT payers.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.420
In this regard, those enterprises

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.240
that are VAT payers, buying

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.480
products from such an individual

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.080
entrepreneur, cannot reduce

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.960
the amount of VAT they

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.840
are obliged to pay as

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.220
a tax to the state.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.440
This situation arises in

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.740
entrepreneurs who operate under

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.740
a simplified taxation system and

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.860
on the basis of a patent

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.500
and on the basis of a single

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.440
tax on the tax.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.220
Let us look at the example.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.760
For example, you

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.880
are a VAT payer.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.000
In the first quarter, the revenue

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:19.040
was 110 rubles, including 10

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:20.700
rubles VAT.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.460
In the same period, you purchased

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.340
products for 55 rubles, including

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.000
VAT 5 rubles.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.840
You can take these 5 rubles to deduct.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.780
That is, you will have to

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.280
pay the state 10 rubles minus

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.860
5 and that 5 rubles of

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.980
value added tax.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.500
This is a matter of course,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.000
as long as you and your supplier

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.300
are VAT payers.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.340
If your supplier is an organization

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.300
or an individual entrepreneur

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.860
who is not a VAT payer,

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.100
then you can not accept these

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:08.060
5 rubles of VAT as deductions.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.440


00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.700
In this case, you will

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.100
have to pay a total of 10 rubles

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.840
of value added tax.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.940
The essence of the question here

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.300
is that by the idea of organizations

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.220
that are not VAT payers, should

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:36.140
not include in the final value

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.980
of their products for

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:44.740
buyers this value

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.780
added tax.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.700
That is, their products should be cheaper

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.480
for this amount.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.520
But life shows that everyone wants to

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.260
sell more expensive, and the

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.800
prices of organizations that

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.340
run a simplified taxation

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.540
system are not different from the

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.080
prices of organizations and individual

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.980
entrepreneurs who keep their

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.440
accounting according to the

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.660
usual system.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.480
Thus, your buyer is forced

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.800
to pay higher taxes than

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.920
in the situation when he

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.880
as a contractor has

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.600
VAT payers.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.500
You can convince him that it is profitable

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.960
for him to work with you by only

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.500
lowering the price of his products.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.140
Another important point in relation

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.160
to the advantages and disadvantages

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.100
of such an organizational form

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.180
as an individual entrepreneur

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.000
is the status.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.060
The fact is that for some types

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.780
of business, for some contractors,

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.860
your status has a certain

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.360
importance.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.720
Then, when your entire business

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.060
is built on your name, built on your

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.320
authority, and you don’t need to

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.100
hire a large number of employees, when

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.120
the scale of your business is not large,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.060
then the status of an individual

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.420
entrepreneur is quite convenient.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.080


00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.420
But when your business reaches

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.320
a certain size, and when your

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.120
partners and contractors are large

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.260
organizations, then often the

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.940
status of an individual entrepreneur

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.760
does not satisfy them.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.020
It is difficult to deal

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.720
with an individual entrepreneur.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.940
There is a similar opinion

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.480
among some entrepreneurs,

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.320
some executives and business

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.180
owners.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.260
We have considered the main aspects

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.700
related to the specifics

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.940
of entrepreneurial activity

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.500
as an individual entrepreneur.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.860
The most common legal

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.780
form of entrepreneurial

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.280
activity is a limited

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.940
liability company.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.740
What is his advantage?

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.000
A limited liability company

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.740
differs from an individual entrepreneur

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.140
in that the participants of the

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.820
company are liable for its

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.880
obligations only in the amount

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.420
of the value of their contributions

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.000
to the company’s authorized

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.120
capital.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.560
If the company’s authorized

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.520
capital is 10 thousand rubles,

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.820
this is the minimum amount

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.240
set to date, then your liability

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.040
is determined by this size,

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.240
that is, 10 thousand rubles.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.020
You personally, as the founder

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.780
of the company, cannot be penalized

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.640
for your personal property,

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.780
nor for your spouse’s property.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.900
As I said, the amount of

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.080
the company’s capital cannot

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.820
be less than 10,000 rubles.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.180
The maximum amount of the company’s

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.720
capital is not limited.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.340
Payment of the company’s

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.600
capital is possible in money

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.940
and property.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.160
When paying with money, this operation

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.760
is very simple.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.460
After the establishment of the company or

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.540
before the submission of the tax documents

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.600
to the inspection, you are obliged to pay

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.860
the amount of money specified

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.540
in the charter documents to the company's

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.420
account.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:09.480
You can contribute 50% of the capital

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:14.080
at the beginning, the remaining 50% can

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.120
be contributed during the year.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.980
The second form of established

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.880
capital is property.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.240
This operation can also

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.860
be quite simple.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.920
If your capital, formed by the

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.400
property, does not exceed 20

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:39.080
thousand rubles, then you, together

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.100
with your partners or you personally,

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.560
if you are the sole founder

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.280
of the company, have the right to

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.440
independently assess your

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.340
contribution.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.340
For example, if you contribute

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.380
a pen to the company’s established

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.220
capital, then you can

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.080
make a corresponding estimate that

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.440
I estimate this pen at 20 thousand

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.700
rubles, and thus your established

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.620
capital will be formed.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.340
And no one can challenge this

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.720
assessment, and no one will

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.400
do it, as practice shows.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.900
No one needs it because it is

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.660
a very small amount of established

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:29.780
capital.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.280
The same is true if there are

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.200
several partners in the society,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.040
you can agree that you contribute a

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.700
pen and your partner contribute

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.460
a notebook, and if you both are

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.320
satisfied, then your established

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.820
capital will be formed in this way.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.120
If your capital, contributed

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.880
by the property, its value exceeds

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.360
20 thousand rubles, then you

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.700
must contact an independent valuator.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.860
The value of the property contributed

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.200
by the established capital cannot be

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.920
higher than the value determined

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.960
by the independent appraiser.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.340
Compared to closed joint-

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.660
stock companies, the

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.640
law on limited liability

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.700
companies is simpler

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.120
and gives entrepreneurs more

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.420
freedom in shaping the

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.800
principles of the company's

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.100
work and management.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.420
The participant has the right to leave

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.440
the company at any time, regardless of

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.340
the consent of other participants.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.720
The company is obliged to pay

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.340
such a participant the value

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.700
of the company's assets, proportional

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:04.360
to the size of his share in the

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.180
company.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.540
This point is, on the one hand,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.900
the advantage of a limited liability

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.720
society, and on the other hand, the

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.280
disadvantage.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:22.500
Because if your business has a certain

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:27.920
size, if your business size largely

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:32.760
determines the possibility of

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.460
making a profit, then such a

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:42.520
sharp reduction in the assets of

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.060
the company, for example, when

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.860
the membership of the founder, who

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.680
had 50 percent in the society,

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.940
is left, it can be critical for

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.700
the further activity of the society,

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.700
that is, your business is reduced

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.180
by 50 percent, it

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.540
can be very unpleasant

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.120
and painful.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:12.300
At the same time, there is another

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.100
disadvantage of a limited liability

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.340
company, if you want to change the

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.560
composition of the members

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.900
of the company, you need

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.180
to apply to the tax inspectorate, that

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.640
is, to submit documents there and

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.420
wait for the due period for

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.800
their state registration.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.760
And until the time of state

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.720
registration, you often can’t

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.880
take any action with your

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.980
new partners.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.110
The next legal form, which

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.770
is most often used

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.190
for business

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.430
activity, is a closed

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.030
joint-stock company.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.230
A joint-stock company is a commercial

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.910
organization, a charter and a capital

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.850
that is divided into a certain

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.350
number of shares certifying

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.750
the obligatory rights of its

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.810
participants.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.170
The members of a limited

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.650
liability company

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.350
may be one person

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.730
or several persons.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.570


00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:33.590
If the number of shareholders exceeds

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:41.690
50, then it is already a company, an open

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.910
joint-stock company.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.530
If the number of shareholders is

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.410
less than 50, it is a closed

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.670
joint-stock company.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.710
If the participant, founder

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.870
of a joint-stock company is

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.250
the sole person, the

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.970
constituent documents are

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.750
only the charter.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.650
The sole shareholder makes a written

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.810
decision on the establishment of

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.210
a company, in which he says that I am

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.310
such a company, I have decided to create

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.950
a company, to name it such a company,

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.590
and it will have such a

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.330
legal address.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:24.110
It adopts a charter containing all the

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.330
necessary points that reflect the

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.030
specifics of its activities.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.390
What are the advantages of

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.650
a shareholding company?

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.470
Shareholders are not liable

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.390
for the obligations of the company,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.270
as in limited liability companies,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.510
and bear the risk of losses

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.850
related to its activities

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.310
within the value of the

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.110
shares belonging to them.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.270
Shareholders of the company have the

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.650
right to alienate their own shares without

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.550
the consent of other shareholders of the company.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:33:59.410
What does this mean?

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.010
This means that you can sell

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.150
your shares to whom you want and

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.610
when you want.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.330
The only limitation here is that

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.550
you are obliged before selling

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:16.290
shares to a third party to offer

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:21.710
to buy them to other shareholders.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.350
This is a mandatory rule in

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.930
a closed joint-stock company.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.390
Another notable advantage of

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.090
a joint-stock company is that a joint-

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.990
stock company does not need

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.670
to apply to the tax inspection,

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.590
to submit some documents there

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.530
when changing shareholders.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.710
That is, if you wanted to sell

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.590
your shares to someone,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.830
then this operation is done,,

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:55.590
in your office literally in

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.330
half an hour.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.270
A mandatory condition for a transaction

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.650
to buy and sell shares is that

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:08.070
your issuance of shares must be

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.390
registered with the Federal

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.230
Service for the Securities Market.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.590
Without such registration, all transactions for

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.130
the purchase and sale of shares are null and null.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.750
This is a discomfort and additional

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.590
cost for the founders of

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.970
a joint-stock company.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.150
But you must assess yourself, what is

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.390
convenient for you, how important

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.610
for you are these advantages that this

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.670
organizational legal form gives.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.190
So, the transaction made

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.090
with shares is usually due to

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.830
several documents.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:57.070
The contract of sale of shares and

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.550
changes to the register of shareholders.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:02.990
That is, on the basis of the contract

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.710
of sale to the register of shareholders,

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.750
which lists all persons holding

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.970
shares of the company, the corresponding

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.950
records should be made and

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.650
the new owner of shares should

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.770
be issued a extract from

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.230
this register, which should

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:30.250
be listed the number of shares

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.210
he owns and their value.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.070
The shareholder may not demand

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.210
the company to repay its shares,

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.630
except in special cases

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.010
stipulated by law.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:44.770
What does this mean for the participants in society?

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.690
This means that if you invested your

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.410
funds in a certain company,

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.730
you can not return them otherwise

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.130
than by selling them to another

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.930
person, the one who is

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.530
interested in those shares.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.210
In order to sell, they

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.270
must have value for

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.070
the buyer.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.410
And this is only possible when your

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.790
business is sufficiently developed,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:20.390
sufficiently transparent, and the buyer

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.750
understands what profit it can bring.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:30.110
If you, working, developing this business,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.930
have not reached the corresponding

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.250
indicators of profitability,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.690
then you are unlikely to be able

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.170
to sell these shares to someone, and

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.790
so you will have nothing to do,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.250
either continue to work and develop

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.090
this enterprise, or depart from

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.610
business, counting on dividends

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.550
in the future.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.970
But anyway, it all depends on the value

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.490
of the shares, on the profitability of the company.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.490
There are certain situations

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.210
stipulated by law in which you can

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.970
demand the redemption of your shares.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.790
For example, if the general meeting

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.690
of shareholders, which is

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.590
the top management body of the

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.230
company, voted for a major deal,

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.330
and you were against that deal,

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.030
then you can demand that

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.190
the shareholders, the

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.350
company, to buy your shares.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.630
There are several other situations

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.670
similar to this.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.290
These are specified in the Act

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.450
on Stock Companies.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.930
In general, the law on a joint-

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:52.610
stock company differs from the law

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.270
on a company in that it is clearly

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.790
and detailed enough, and it describes

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.730
all sorts of situations, relationships

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.850
of shareholders.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.110
The rights of shareholders are

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.630
protected.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:12.510
In this sense, it is one of the

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.010
most modern Russian laws, which

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.710
is in accordance with the world

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.810
standards.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.210
What are the disadvantages

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.770
of this legal form?

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.450
As we have already said, from the point

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.370
of view of registration of a joint-stock

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.530
company, having passed state registration

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.870
with the tax inspectorate, it is obliged

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.430
to register the issuance of shares

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.630
in the federal service for the

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.470
securities market.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.990
Without this registration, all transactions

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.830
with shares are void and

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.270
you may be fined.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.390
This procedure is quite complicated, and

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:56.450
lawyers are unlikely to be able to cope with it.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.810
The state duty is quite high, 10 thousand

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.450
rubles, and legal companies

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.750
specialists take about 10 thousand

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.110
rubles for this service too.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:11.890
Thus, your costs for completing

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.130
all registration procedures for

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.370
a joint-stock company are significantly

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.370
higher than in limited

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.690
liability companies.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.790
Let us consider the general provisions

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.610
for LLCs and closed joint-stock

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.830
companies that unite them.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:31.070
We will not consider open-

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.810
source companies because

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.530
we are talking about

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.490
small, medium-sized.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.550
An open joint-stock company is

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.670
a company with more than 50

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.870
members.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.170
This legal form

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.450
is usually used for

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.750
large organizations.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.730
And in those situations when it is necessary

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:04.000
to attract funding in the open market.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.650
So what unites OOO and ZAO?

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.430
This is the same system

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.450
of accounting and taxation

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.470
structure under the

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.810
usual taxation system.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.850
That is, 24% of the income tax, 2.2%

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:27.410
of the property tax, 18 or 10% of

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.670
VAT, 26% of the rate of the

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.510
single social tax from the salary

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:40.310
fund and 2.2% from the salary

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.430
fund depending on the type

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.990
of activity for injury.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:50.510
There are a number of taxes that are

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.090
determined by the specifics of your activity.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.290
With the simplified

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.870
tax system, as in the case

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.810
of an individual entrepreneur,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.910
it is simple accounting

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.190
and minimum taxes, which

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.850
we have already talked

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.750
about.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.830
When registering the state duty

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.770
for the LLC, and for the LLC, and

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.670
for all other legal entities,

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.570
is 2000 rubles.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.110
All registration forms can be found

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.530
on the website of the tax services, in

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.990
particular in Moscow on the website

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.070
of the.ru bridge tax or reference

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.590
information bases such as Guarantor,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.790
Consultant.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.010
The term of registration of legal entities

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.450
and LLC, and ZOO, and other by law

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.170
is collated in five working days.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.750
In Moscow, this period

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.210
has been extended to 7

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.090
days.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.750
The essential factor,

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.310
the significant, if you can

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.130
so express, the disadvantage

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.290
of any legal form of a

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.090
legal entity, is a complex

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.610
and long liquidation procedure.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.230
It entails, in addition

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.550
to multiple and quite complex procedures,

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.070
a full tax check for the last

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.630
three years of the enterprise

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.330
since the time the tax

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.170
inspection was filed for

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.610
the liquidation of the company.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:32.510
As you probably guess, passing

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.350
such a check of pleasure

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.310
is small with the approach of

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.210
our tax authorities, when they

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.370
try to get stuck for something,

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.170
at least for something to

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.330
charge you some fines and pennies.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:48.770


00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:54.670
The company is liable for

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.390
its obligations to

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.210
all its property.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.330
Therefore, if your organization has not

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.450
managed to deal with some

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.990
liabilities, then having some assets

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.170
in the balance sheet, you risk

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.150
breaking up with them.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:15.310
The company, as well as the limited

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.510
liability company,

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.570
is not liable for the obligations

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.850
of its members.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.730
Your personal life is your personal life,

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.450
the activities of society.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.930
The appointed body of management

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.950
of a joint-stock company and a limited

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.070
liability company is the general

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.630
meeting of the participants or

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.810
shareholders.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.270
There are many parallels in the regulations

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.890
for the convening and working of the general

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.210
meeting of the company and the joint-stock

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.850
company, although these regulations

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.700
in closed joint-stock companies

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.290
are more detailed and many points

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.050
are written more strictly and clearly.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:01.770
The size of the capital and the methods

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:06.690
of its formation for the company and for

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:11.350
the joint-stock companies are also the same.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.370
Another factor that

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.090
unites all legal

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.370
entities is the need

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.210
to have a legal

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.090
address.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:25.930
This expression is usual.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.390
The legislation provides for a different

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.770
formulation of the

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.670
location of the legal entity.

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:35.070
It must be stated in the constituent

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.630
documents of the organization.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:40.790
The location of a legal entity

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.770
is determined by its state registration.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.150
That is, if you are registered

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.430
in Moscow, then the location

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.130
of your company, it naturally

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.430
has some Moscow address.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.070
The location of a legal entity

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.650
is considered the location

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.430
of its sole executive body.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:09.390
The place where your director

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.430
works.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:16.610
Unfortunately, the Russian practice

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.450
is rather unpleasant for

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.450
entrepreneurs in relation to

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.690
this legal address.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.310
The fact is that, as you perfectly

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.190
understand, any enterprise,

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.830
any organization in the process

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.930
of its activity can repeatedly

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:41.590
change its office and this can

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.710
be due to a variety of reasons.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:47.130
The staff increased or decreased,

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:51.390
rates, rent and so on and

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.170
so on changed.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.110
And the legislation, unfortunately,

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.130
obliges taxpayers, obliges organizations

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.990
every time when changing the location

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.750
of the organization to

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.750
make changes to the constituent

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.210
documents.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.870
This is quite a ridiculous situation,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.250
because you can change your

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:20.850
office several times a year.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.490
Maybe this happens.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.990
And every time you ideally should

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.690
run to the tax inspectorate and

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.730
make changes to the charter documents.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:33.250
In practice, most organizations

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.630
have a formal legal address,

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.330
supported by some formal

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.650
contract concluded with

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.630
some organization, with

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.350
the owner of some premises.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.890
Having such a legal address, they move

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.890
from one office to another and

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.770
do not submit information about this

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.130
to the tax inspectorate.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:05.510
And tax inspections look through their

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.230
fingers at this, then in order to

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.370
increase the collection of taxes or

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.230
when some new directions and trends

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:18.150
appear, they periodically

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.370
start to shake entrepreneurs

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.950
again in connection with this

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.610
legal address and demand that

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:30.410
the location of the organization

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:35.910
corresponds to its actual address.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:39.270
The address at which he is currently

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:39.910
working.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:41.770
And then taxpayers are forced

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.770
to look again for ways to get

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.810
out of the situation.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.850
But you may be told that you

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.030
will work for a long time and

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.810
with a formal legal address.

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.750
But if the tax authority

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.070
wants, it will force you to change

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.090
it by blocking the account and

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.090
applying other preventive administrative

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.870
measures.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.990
Let us now consider another type

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.250
of organizations, which are

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.450
also widely used by entrepreneurs,

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.270
although they are called

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.190
non-profit organizations.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:26.470
A non-profit organization

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.670
is an organization that does not

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.370
have profit as its main purpose

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.110
of activity and does not distribute

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.430
profit among its members.

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:40.930
This wording is taken directly

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.450
from the law.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:46.110
The law believes that non-

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.930
profit organizations can be

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.270
created to some social, charitable

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:54.990
goals and the like.

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:59.370
Although in practice, for example,

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:03.470
all educational institutions, even commercial,

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.910
in Russia are registered

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.250
as non-profit organizations,

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.590
but the owners created them

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.770
precisely for the purpose of

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.330
earning profit.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:16.830
In general, educational

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.750
activities are quite

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.350
profitable and quite

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.750
commercial.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:26.670
But why is it that our state and our

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.570
licensing bodies have an approach

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.270
to educational organizations

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.490
that they require that an organization

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.730
that wants to provide educational

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.390
services has such

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.650
an organizational and

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.190
legal form in the form

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.950
of a non-profit organization.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.070
We will only talk about those non-

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.310
profit organizations, organizations

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:58.110
that do not belong to the category

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.790
of public organizations.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.430
As a matter of fact, social movements,

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.530
social foundations, political movements,

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.930
religious movements and the like.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:12.790
The organizations we will consider

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.670
are simple non-profit funds,

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.030
autonomous non-profit organizations,

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.770
institutions and

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:21.070
partnerships.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.850
The law on non-profit organizations

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.970
states that a non-profit

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.990
organization can only carry

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.550
out business activities insofar

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.170
as it serves you can engage

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:39.530
in some commercial activity

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:43.270
in order to direct the profits

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.190
received to the purposes

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.170
for which the organization

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.010
was created.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:55.350
That is, say, for the purpose of developing

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.690
education or for the purpose of conducting

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.910
a gas pipeline to the country parks,

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.810
in some country partnership.

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.810
This can be any activity

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:13.030
that brings profit.

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:14.770
This is the production of some

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.570
goods and the provision of some services

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.110
and so on and so on.

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.190
In fact, any activity that is

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:26.510
carried out by ordinary commercial

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.110
organizations.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:30.190
Thus, if you follow the letter

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.330
of the law, the organizational and

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.870
legal form of non-profit organizations

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.090
is not intended for doing

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.850
business.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.130
But, as is known, reality differs

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.790
from legislation and entrepreneurs

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.310
then, when such an organizational

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.210
legal form is convenient for

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:53.430
them, they use it for their

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.310
purposes.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:55.970
A distinctive feature of non-

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.790
profit organizations is also

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.070
that, in addition to the profits

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.410
derived from commercial activities,

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.370
the sources of the formation

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.190
of property of the non-

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.290
profit organization can be regular

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.970
and one-off receipts from

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.290
founders and voluntary

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.790
property contributions and

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.670
donations.

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:22.110
These money receipts, if they are spent

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.110
for the chartered purposes of

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.130
the organization, do not

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.330
have any taxes.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.930
In different situations, this is

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:34.110
quite convenient and, for example,

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.070
when you are actually engaged in some

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.390
activity aimed at achieving some

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.670
there, social benefits for some

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.210
group of people who have joined,

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.170
you can accept membership

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:51.250
contributions, you can peacefully,

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.710
freely accept some donations,

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.890
and if you will spend them for

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.650
the purposes for which the

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.570
organization is created,

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.730
then you will not have

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.610
any tax obligations.

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:08.490
The main thing is that it

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.450
is documented, clearly, properly

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.090
documented, so that the tax

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.030
inspectorate has no reason

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.270
to make claims to you.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:19.330
In other situations, the

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.670
commercial activities of a

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.570
non-profit organization are

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:27.480
taxed according to the same system

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:31.840
as the activities of any LLC,

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:32.760
for example.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.540
The procedure for registration

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.460
of a non-profit organization differs

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.500
from the registration of other legal

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:43.660
entities in that the documents for registration

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.760
are filed not to the tax inspection,

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:49.120
but to the registration

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:51.040
service of the Ministry

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.520
of Justice of the Russian Federation.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.240
Non-profit organizations are

00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.280
registered longer than

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:02.540
those registered

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.100
by the tax inspectorate.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.720
On average, it takes about a month from

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:11.840
the moment of submission of the documents

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:12.780
for registration.

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.020
In terms of the formation of statutory

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.700
documents, the legislation

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.700
gives quite wide opportunities for

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.400
the establishment of the

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.380
principles of management of a non-

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.980
profit organization, and this

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.600
is a certain convenience.

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.260
You can quite freely describe those

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.530
principles that are important to

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:41.310
you and correspond to the specifics

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.130
of your activity to the maximum

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.570
extent possible.

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.390
The next aspect

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.810
of business activity

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.870
that cannot be stopped

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:53.650
is licensing.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.050
The types of activities that

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.770
are subject to licensing are

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:00.330
determined by the law on

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.890
licensing of certain types of activities.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:03.930
He is called so.

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:06.990
It contains general

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.730
provisions on licensing.

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:12.870
More detailed regulations and

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.050
procedures described by regulatory

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:20.150
acts of relevant bodies and agencies.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.110
The main activities subject

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.250
to licensing are listed

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:28.290
in Article 17 of the Licensing Act.

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.610
Today, the list of these activities

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.090
has been significantly reduced

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.590
and much fewer business

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.310
types are subject to licensing

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.170
than it was five years

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.010
ago.

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.030
For example, this is licensing

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.150
pharmaceutical activities, manufacturing

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.570
of medicines, licensing

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:54.670
of banking operations, and

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.410
so on.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:58.350
By the way, such activities

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.130
as banking, exchange

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:03.070
activities and activities

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.190
in the field of

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.350
alcohol production are

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.830
not regulated.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.750
In general, it is regulated not in

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.090
legal licensing, but by separate

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.950
normative legal acts.

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:18.110
These laws contain the basic

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:22.250
provisions on licensing each

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.730
of the listed activities.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:30.130
Small business is another aspect

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:32.550
that directly affects

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.310
everyone who wants to engage

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.330
in entrepreneurial activities.

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:42.270
Until recently, the status of a small

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.050
enterprise gave certain advantages

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.930
to entrepreneurs.

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:50.610
But with the simplified tax system,

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.070
these advantages have come

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:53.690
to them.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.510
Previously, only organizations

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.430
registered as small business

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.470
entities could work

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:07.630
on the simplified tax system.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:10.450
This right is granted to any

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:11.630
organization.

00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:15.130
Therefore, among the advantages that

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.190
this status gives, the

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.930
preferential rate for renting municipal

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:25.030
real estate remains the most significant

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.350
to date and is determined

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.810
by specific legislative

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.770
and regulatory acts of federal

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:38.370
subjects and municipal

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.850
bodies.

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:40.990
Small business entities

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.990
may be commercial organizations,

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.130
mainly capital, whose

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.090
share of legal entities

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:56.650
does not exceed 25 percent.

00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:59.170
If the founders or shareholders

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.510
of the company are legal

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.270
persons, they must own no more

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.730
than 25 percent of shares

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:15.150
or shares in the company.

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:17.650
In addition, the average

00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:21.210
number of employees of the

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.270
small business entity may

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.350
not exceed certain values

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.190
set by legislation.

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:30.830
Subjects of small business

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.170
are understood as individuals

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:37.070
engaged in entrepreneurship,

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.850
i.e. individual entrepreneurs,

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:40.190
and organizations that

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:44.110
decided to obtain such status

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.170
and corresponding

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.530
requirements.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:55.770
Let us now consider such an important

00:59:55.780 --> 01:00:00.090
part of business activity as

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.310
the relationship of business

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.930
partners.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.350
Unfortunately, the culture

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.770
of interaction, the culture

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.190
of partnership in Russia

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.410
today is not sufficiently developed,

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.050
and in this connection

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.150
there are many unpleasant situations.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.570
Partnership in business is very

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.830
close to relationships in family life.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.210
Unfortunately, we have to

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.810
observe situations when friends,

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:35.670
friends, relatives,

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:39.190
spouses start some business

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.210
and when it comes to getting

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.730
some significant

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:51.150
profits, there are difficult

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.710
conflicts between them.

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:58.110
Therefore, one of the very important

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.630
rules when creating a business in

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.170
partnership with someone else is the following.

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:08.450
When planning a relationship, think about divorce.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.670
When planning some joint activity,

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.030
planning some joint business,

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.670
you must from the beginning very

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.570
clearly, very responsible and

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.670
thoughtfully approach all aspects

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.130
that relate to leaving the

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.450
business, which relate

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.410
to situations when your ways with

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.390
partners differ.

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.470
And here you need to be guided by

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.410
the rules that the word not written

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.510
is a lie.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.310
You will be proofing each other

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.670
for a long time who meant what,

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:47.550
who said what, who thought what,

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.790
if you did not write it down in the

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.610
charter documents or in the form

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.410
of some other document, even

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.150
some informal agreement between

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.170
you.

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.750
So let’s consider partnership

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.630
in a limited liability

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.810
society.

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:07.990
If a company is founded by one person,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.090
then, as we have already said, the

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:11.670
charter approved by that person

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.150
is the founder of the company document.

01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:16.690
In the event of an increase in the

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.570
number of members of the company to two

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.830
or more, the constituent agreement between

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.910
them must be concluded, and the partnership

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.690
of the participants shall be

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.010
determined by this constituent agreement

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.350
and the charter of the company.

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.490
In the founding contract of the company,

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.210
the founders undertake to create

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.470
the company and determine the procedure

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.450
for their interaction with this institution.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.070
That is, it can be written who is obliged

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.070
to do what when creating

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.890
a society, who is performing

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.030
what procedures.

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.970
The constituent contract shall also determine

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.170
the size of the authorized capital, the

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.670
ratio of shares between the participants,

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.890
the size and composition of the contributions

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.290
they make, the way in which these contributions

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.370
were made by property or money,

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.970
and the procedure for their introduction

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.390
into the principal capital of

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.150
the company at its establishment.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.550
There can also be described the liability

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.650
of the founder of the company for

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:23.870
violation of the conditions and the

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.670
order of distribution of these duties

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:32.490
between the founders and violation of

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.090
the order, distribution of profits

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.030
between the participants.

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.170
In addition, it stipulates the composition

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.350
of the organs of the society and the procedure

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.050
for the members to leave the society.

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:50.610
The contribution to the company’s

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.310
capital may be money, securities,

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.350
other things or property

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.470
rights that have monetary

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.750
valuation.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.710
That is, as we said, you can contribute

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.190
to the principal capital both

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.730
money and a loved other asset

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:12.590
that can be valued in money.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:17.670
If the nominal value of the share

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.330
of the participants in the main

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.670
capital of the company, paid not with

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.030
a monetary contribution, is more

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.530
than 200 minimum wage amounts, today

01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:32.010
it is 20 thousand rubles, then such

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.910
a contribution, as we have already

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.790
said, should be assessed by independent

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.570
assessors.

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.410
A contribution, not a monetary

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.530
contribution, to the principal

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.750
may be transferred both

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.930
for indefinite use and for temporary use.

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:54.810
In other words, a teaching contract

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.710
may stipulate that a participant

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.690
in a company transfers to him

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:04.490
some property or some intangible

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.950
asset for a certain period

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.450
of time.

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:16.010
The value of use of this asset is the

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.350
contribution of the participant

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.370
in the company’s charter capital.

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:26.590
After this period, the participant has

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.310
the right to take his contribution, take

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:34.170
his property, and at the same time he

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:37.470
must not contribute anything in return.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:44.930
If he decides to take his contribution

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:50.350
before the expiry of the specified

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.830
period, he is obliged to provide

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.430
the company with its replacement

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.850
or monetary compensation,

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:02.850
which will allow the company

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:06.050
to use some other property

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.410
necessary for his activities.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.590


01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:13.650
In addition to the teaching contract,

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:16.270
the relationship of partners is determined

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.790
by the charter of the company.

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:22.830
In general, the charter of the society

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.570
is the most important document,

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:28.310
and it contains all the basic

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.290
provisions on the order of

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.290
the company and on the relationship

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.490
of partners.

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:40.350
It should contain a certain set of

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.430
items, which is determined by the law,

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.350
that is, the law has a clear list

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.710
of the provisions of the charter,

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:54.470
which must be included in it.

01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:57.230
The main information is the location,

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.910
the full shortened company name

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:01.790
of the company, the composition

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.830
and competence of the management

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.390
bodies, the procedure for making

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.790
decisions, including on issues

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.270
that are adopted unanimously

01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:14.770
at the meeting of the participants

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.690
of the company.

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:20.250
The charter also records the rights and obligations

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.430
of the participants of the company, information about

01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:25.830
the procedure and consequences of the withdrawal

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.050
of the participant from the company and

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.890
information about the procedure for the

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.230
transfer of share in the company to other persons.

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.330
These are the most fundamental

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:39.610
points.

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:42.410
In addition, other information

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.370
may be included that is not contrary

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.190
to the legislation of the Russian

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.450
Federation.

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:54.490
The relationship is defined by

01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:57.530
the charter of a limited liability company.

01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:01.750
One of the specific aspects of relationships

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.350
are the rights and duties of

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.650
the participants of society.

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:10.870
Unfortunately, in legal practice,

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.070
this part of the charter is

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.290
not given sufficient attention

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.210
to this part of the charter.

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:26.030
Although it has, in my opinion, an

01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:31.010
important importance, first of all in

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.970
the relationships of partners

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:36.690
involved in business.

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:39.670
The fact is that in the charter of the

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.450
company may be written some obligations

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.970
of the participants of the company on

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:49.670
its activities.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:53.430
For example, one member of the

01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:56.970
company is obliged to regularly

01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:01.290
obtain licenses necessary for

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.150
the company's work, the other

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.190
is obliged to interact

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.710
with local authorities,

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.090
to obtain some permits

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.410
from them.

01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:17.770
Another participant may take

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.730
on the responsibility to conduct

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.670
even a marketing research.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:26.650
And if it is written in the charter

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:30.010
of the company, if in the charter of

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.710
the company you write what consequences

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.370
does not fulfill these duties

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.030
to the participants of the society

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.790
for it, then your relations with other

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.270
partners will be more understandable,

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.850
simple and transparent.

01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:54.210
This can also be related to the

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.510
distribution of profits, the

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.590
distribution of dividends.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.310
Unfortunately, in the practice

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.410
of legal this issue is very poorly worked

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.290
out, and the precedents are also

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.750
very difficult to find, but the

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:16.170
law allows these aspects, these

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:19.350
moments to write, and they can

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.670
actually facilitate the relationship

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.590
between partners, can

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:30.350
settle them in a civilized way.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.830
For example, if one of the participants

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.930
of the company for some reason

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.470
did not fulfill the duties that

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.510
were assigned to him in the

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.830
charter, then when the case comes

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.450
to the distribution of dividends,

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.350
other participants can make

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:59.410
claims to him, say that

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.190
you did not fulfill such duties.

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:05.930
The company has incurred

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.110
such costs.

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:10.190
It was for example forced

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.290
to pay some other company for obtaining

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:17.610
a license for certain

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.050
activities.

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:21.330
These expenses, since you should

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:27.250
have dealt with this matter, we

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.710
deduct from your dividends.

01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:34.090
And if all these aspects, if the order

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:36.250
of making such a decision and the

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.490
grounds for it are clearly prescribed

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.210
in the charter of the society, then you

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:50.810
will not have a conflict, and the participant

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.570
in the society will have to

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.150
agree to such a situation.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.890
Therefore, when creating a society,

01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.530
when you agree on interaction,

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.610
who and how will work on the development

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:07.290
of society, it is desirable

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.510
to write all these moments

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.230
as clearly and in detail

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.610
as possible.

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:16.830
The next aspect that should reflect the

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.650
charter are management, management

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.970
issues and the distribution of

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:28.850
the income of the society in this

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.750
regard.

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:33.150
What is meant here?

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:36.650
The charter of the company

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:39.850
prescribes the procedure for the adoption

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.890
of decisions by the general

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.290
meeting and prescribes the

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.170
powers of the sole executive body

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.490
of the company.

01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:52.210
That is, the breadth of the powers

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.550
of the general director you want to

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.790
grant him is determined by the

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.630
provisions of the charter.

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:06.450
And this too needs to be thought about.

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:11.310
Also, the distribution of income,

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:15.370
as it is determined by your shares,

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:21.450
you must also think in advance of

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:26.230
who has what share in the society,

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.930
depending on what contribution

01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:31.050
he makes to the activities

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.230
of the society.

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:35.910
For example, here the situation can

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.150
be as follows that one participant in

01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:43.730
the company contributes some

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.630
material assets to the charter

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.930
capital, and the other contributes

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:53.130
his knowledge and skills.

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:56.230
And this knowledge and skills are

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.310
so significant that another participant

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.210
in society can agree that his share

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:12.190
will be somehow changed in favor

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.170
of the person who will be engaged

01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:18.650
in the management and

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.910
development of society.

01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:24.770
And thus, there may be a redistribution

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.310
of income between participants

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.350
in a certain way depending

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.410
on their contributions.

01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:39.210
If any of the participants

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:46.270
of the company decided to withdraw

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.270
from the company, he

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.730
can do so at any time by writing

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.970
a statement to the management

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:57.210
of the company and other

01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.310
participants.

01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:03.030
The company in this situation is obliged

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.070
to pay the value of the company's assets,

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.730
the proportional share of this

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:14.250
participant in the company.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:17.030
It is obliged to do so within

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.690
six months after the end of the

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:24.830
financial year in which such a

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.430
statement was written.

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:29.810
That is, if you filed a request to withdraw

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:33.470
from the members of the company in

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.190
June, then you will have to

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.250
wait for the end of the calendar

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:42.670
and financial year.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:46.450
The same is true of our financial

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.250
accounting system.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.770
And the company will be obliged

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:57.930
to pay your share within the

01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:00.310
next six months.

01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:05.330
As I said, it can be quite

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:09.370
painful for society.

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:15.270
Here you can provide some milder

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.050
options for paying a share to

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:22.270
the member of the society.

01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:25.330
Another aspect of the partnership is

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.310
the procedure for transferring

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.030
a share of the main capital of the company

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.750
to a third party.

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:38.170
The participants of the society may,

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.950
by agreement between themselves,

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.530
prescribe this order in different ways.

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:48.930
The OJSC law offers a wide

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.130
range of possibilities.

01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:54.570
You can write in the law that the

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.030
members of the company have the

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.830
right to sell their share only to other

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.950
members, and you can write that to

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.750
any third parties.

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:09.350
This depends on your specific

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.990
situation, on the nature

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.790
of the relationship

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.670
between your company’s partners.

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:24.910
Now consider all the main aspects

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.770
of partnership in a closed joint-

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.890
stock company.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.190
In a closed joint-stock company,

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:34.990
when it is created by more than

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.350
one person, a constituent agreement

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.550
is also concluded.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.820
It also describes the order of actions

01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:50.860
of shareholders to create a company,

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:56.540
the procedure for payment of shares and

01:17:56.550 --> 01:18:00.440
their rights and responsibilities

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.840
to create a company.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.400
The constituent contract is

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:10.700
not the constituent document of

01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:14.460
a joint-stock company and is not

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:18.320
registered by the

01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:20.280
registration body.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.820
There are no stamps and stamps

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:26.480
of the tax inspectorate.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.300
The constituent document of

01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:34.180
a joint-stock company is the charter.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.120
As I said before, the law on

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.820
joint-stock companies is the most

01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:41.540
modern regulatory act and it clearly

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.960
regulates the mutuality of shareholders

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:47.200
and shareholders of

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.040
the company.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.980
It describes and regulates

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:54.100
the various aspects of shareholders’

01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:56.920
relationships that define

01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:01.320
their rights and obligations.

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.900
As in the UN, the most important

01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:07.060
points in the partnership in

01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.600
the CIS are the following.

01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:13.700
This is the procedure for convening meetings

01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:15.840
and making decisions by shareholders’

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:18.280
meetings, the regulations of the executive

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:21.740
body of the company and the procedure

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:24.920
for the transfer of shares to new owners.

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:28.180
Of course, the law on joint-stock

01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:31.780
companies is much broader, but these

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:36.060
are the most important points that

01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:39.100
concern the relations of partners

01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:42.460
in small joint-stock companies.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.840
If there are many shareholders in

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:48.640
your company, then of course there

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:51.600
are many other items of the law on

01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:54.460
joint-stock companies that are

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.180
important and they should be

01:19:58.190 --> 01:20:00.620
described in detail and clearly

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:04.640
in your charter and reflect, to

01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:06.840
the extent permitted by the law,

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:09.480
the specifics of your relationships,

01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:11.840
the specifics of your

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.700
company's activities.

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:16.280
Let us consider some typical

01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:17.620
situations in the relationship

01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:22.700
of partners in LLC and CAA.

01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:24.900
The first situation is as

01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:25.620
follows.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.960
The partners agreed to create

01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:34.400
a new company and formed

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:37.340
the minimum authorized

01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:42.060
capital in cash or property.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.340
The statutory capital is 10 thousand

01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:45.240
rubles.

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:54.010
The main resource in creating and knowledge

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:57.870
and skills of partners.

01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:01.430
And here they start working.

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:03.330
They agreed in advance that they all

01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:06.150
participate together in the management

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.050
and development of society.

01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:11.910
They initially agreed so.

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:13.590
Society is registered, real

01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:17.630
life begins and often it

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.310
turns out that one of the partners,

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.770
let’s say, we have three

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.330
partners.

01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:26.510
The two partners really

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:31.850
work, work, weigh and put

01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:35.410
a lot of effort into which

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:38.270
the society can truly

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.430
develop successfully and

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.110
certain financial

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.950
indicators.

01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:50.050
A year, say, or two, and at this point

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:53.710
a third participant of the society

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.750
appears, which was originally wanted,

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.130
and so the partners agreed, but

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:05.190
for some reason, in fact, did not

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.850
participate in the development

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.330
of the society.

01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:14.930
He comes and says, well, where is the profit?

01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:18.070
Let us share.

01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:22.230
Two other men are in shock.

01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:24.690
Where have you been all that time?

01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:28.830
We wasted, you did nothing and now you

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.430
demand a portion of the profit.

01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:34.610
Would you go somewhere?

01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:37.770
No, I will not go.

01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:41.250
This third party is correctly

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.150
stated.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.110
You are obliged to pay me

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.790
the part of my profit in the form

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.710
of dividends.

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:54.950
And in this situation, the other

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.190
two partners will have nothing

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.050
to do but to pay

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:04.210
the legal part of the profit.

01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:08.490
Therefore, in order to avoid such

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:15.370
a situation, partners must, in advance,

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.570
agree on the creation of the company,

01:23:19.670 --> 01:23:22.570
provide for it and write it down

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.510
in their constituent documents.

01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:32.030
They may write in the charter

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.970
the grounds on which a member of the

01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:40.030
society may be excluded from the society.

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:43.410
These grounds must be clear, clear,

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:46.070
transparent in order for you to

01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:50.650
be able to justify them in court.

01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:53.910
According to the law on limited liability

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.250
companies, a member of the

01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.110
company can be excluded from

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.510
the company only by a court

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.190
decision.

01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:11.410
If you do not write the grounds for the exclusion

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:15.130
in the charter, then with a high degree

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.690
of probability the court will not exclude

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.150
your partner from the members

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.350
of the society.

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:27.530
If you do this, if you

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.490
write down these reasons,

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.190
then you have very high chances

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.910
of success.

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:37.410
Very common is also the situation

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.010
when the participants of society due

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.810
to insufficient corporate culture

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:47.290
in Russia also start to make claims

01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:51.210
to each other, when, for example,

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:54.890
one participant of the society made

01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:59.470
some substantial material contribution

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.090
to the society, and took much more

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:07.970
active part in the management

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:09.890
of the society or,, even

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.510
was directly the general director,

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.750
say, the society, and he is

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.390
so, purely in life, it becomes

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:21.030
offended that I am a

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.110
pasture, and the other partner

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.050
only there some machine or

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:29.390
some equipment contributed

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.730
to the main capital of

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:33.870
the society.

01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:35.790
Why should the society pay such

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.370
a large dividend?

01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:41.130
This position is, of course,

01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:44.250
wrong, because a society with such a significant

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:47.650
contribution to the investment capital

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.230
would hardly have been able to develop

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.530
successfully.

01:25:54.230 --> 01:25:57.890
After all, you knew in advance that another

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:01.610
participant contributes this property, these

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.610
assets, and they are really needed

01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:07.890
by the company for work, for development.

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:12.070
Therefore, it is necessary to immediately

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.770
take this into account and treat it as due.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.140
On the other hand, if you believe

01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:28.160
that your contribution to the development

01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:31.760
of the company is so heavy that

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.240
you should receive more

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:38.060
rewards, more income from its activities

01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:41.880
than it can be due to the dividends

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:45.560
that are distributed, then you should

01:26:45.570 --> 01:26:49.220
agree with the other partner

01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:53.520
that you receive the appropriate

01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:55.420
reward in the form of

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:57.480
salary or in the form of bonuses,

01:26:57.490 --> 01:27:04.460
clearly linked to the amounts of

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.980
profits that the company

01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:12.920
receives from your activities,

01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:15.120
and thus you can balance the

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:17.380
level of income of yours

01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:22.690
and your partner, who made a significant

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:26.470
material contribution or

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.550
a significant contribution

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.510
in the form of some assets

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.870
to the society.

01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:36.410
And, of course, this is a matter

01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.990
of your arrangements, that is,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.990
you must reach an agreement with

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.590
your partners here, you must

01:27:44.970 --> 01:27:49.070
reach an agreement on this issue.

01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:55.410
The next point, which I would like

01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:58.030
to pay attention to, is that people

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.410
who are going to engage in entrepreneurial

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.670
activities, people who want

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.530
to be owners of a certain business,

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.850
must independently study

01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:14.890
all the regulatory legal acts

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:17.510
directly related to their

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:20.690
business, reflecting the

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:24.850
specifics of their business.

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:26.650


01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:29.030
There are not as many as we have

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.670
said to you, and the regulations

01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:35.190
that directly relate to your situation

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:39.690
are even less than we have mentioned.

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:42.670
So don’t think of the labor to

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:45.950
study them, because no one better than

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.630
you will take care of the well-

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.530
being of your business.

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:54.930
This will not allow other people

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.910
you interact with to manipulate

01:28:58.330 --> 01:29:01.930
you, to mislead you, because

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:04.730
unfortunately, such

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:08.250
situations do not occur

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:11.510
as rarely as you would

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.730
like.

01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:16.650
And the better you know these

01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.530
normative legal acts, the

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.530
more confident you will

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:23.730
feel in the various

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:27.030
situations you will have to face.

01:29:27.230 --> 01:29:30.250
Now let’s look at the issues related

01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:35.690
to the company.

01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:40.010
First of all, these are the issues

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:43.790
of labor relations between

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.890
business owners and employees.

01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:49.450
When hiring employees, as you

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.270
all know, they must be employed

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.350
by contracts that should cover

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:59.990
all aspects of your relationship

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.710
with respect to the performance

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.050
of certain duties of

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.890
employees of your company.

01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:14.450
The citizen working under a labor contract

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:16.730
is guaranteed the rights

01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.550
established by federal laws,

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:22.470
and these rights of employees

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.250
are sufficiently well protected.

01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:28.450
In a certain way, it can

01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:31.750
be said that employees are more

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.090
protected from the

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.950
employer than the employer

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.590
from employees.

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:44.270
Therefore, the question of labor relations

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.610
also needs to be paid a lot of attention

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:51.370
and not to forget about the fundamental

01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:55.090
points of these relationships.

01:30:55.150 --> 01:30:58.350
In addition, for violations of

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.110
labor legislation, especially

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.890
for some gross violations, which

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.090
are stipulated by

01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:08.150
the Code on Administrative

01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:09.690
Offences, criminal liability

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:10.930
is provided.

01:31:11.050 --> 01:31:12.910
Labor contracts may be concluded

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.030
for an indefinite period and for a

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.150
certain period, but not more than

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.010
five years.

01:31:20.150 --> 01:31:22.730
For an indefinite period of time,

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.990
you must conclude contracts with

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.830
almost all employees carrying the

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.750
main and quite ordinary work

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.530
duties in your company.

01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:39.150
For a certain period of time, the

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.930
employment contract is concluded with

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:47.730
the CEO, his deputy officers, the

01:31:48.230 --> 01:31:51.910
chief accountant and some other employees

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.510
and the list of which is in the

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.330
Labor Code and these are not so typical

01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:02.850
situations, as a rule, which can

01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:05.550
reflect some specificity

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.270
of your business and hiring

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.290
personnel in connection with

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:12.890
this.

01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:15.510
In the usual situation, which

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.090
is the most common, the list of

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.510
employees with whom a term contract

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.330
can be concluded is

01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:26.210
limited to these listed persons.

01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:30.770
There is a possibility for the conclusion

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:34.210
of temporary employment contracts

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:37.610
with those companies that have received

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:42.000
the status of small enterprises.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.260
This status entails the possibility

01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:49.340
of wider application of fixed-

01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:53.460
term employment contracts.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:58.080
This can be regulated

01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:01.180
and regulated by

01:33:01.190 --> 01:33:03.520
other legal acts.

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.160
They need to be acquainted

01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:09.580
before signing such agreements.

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.180
The next important aspect of labor

01:33:13.190 --> 01:33:14.900
relations is the material responsibility

01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:16.420
of employees.

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.140
Material liability

01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:19.580
applies to all employees

01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:24.160
who deal with some

01:33:24.170 --> 01:33:26.960
values.

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:30.160
In the process of work, these

01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:32.680
values may be lost in some way.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.580
There are two types of liability:

01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:38.000
complete and incomplete.

01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:39.220
Incomplete material

01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:40.620
liability extends to those

01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:46.680
employees who deal with

01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:50.440
these values.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.120
With all other employees

01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:57.540
who are constantly working

01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:59.300
with material values,

01:33:59.310 --> 01:34:02.860
a full liability agreement

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:06.100
can be concluded.

01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:08.540
In addition to the contract

01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:10.960
of employment, there is a separate

01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:13.400
contract on full material liability.

01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:16.080
Such employees, for example,

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.080
include the CEO, chief accountant,

01:34:18.090 --> 01:34:20.940
deputy officers, all

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:24.820
sorts of countermen,

01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:27.220
shippers, and so on.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.940
In the process of working with

01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:37.320
material values, if a certain

01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:40.760
employee for some reason lost

01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:42.780
material values, damaged

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:46.640
some values, he will bear full

01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:51.160
material responsibility for them.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:54.940
Damage under such liability may

01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:59.460
be recovered from the employee in

01:34:59.470 --> 01:35:01.880
the event that the amount of damage

01:35:01.890 --> 01:35:04.860
caused does not exceed the employee's

01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:07.800
average monthly earnings, can

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.860
be recovered by the employer's order.

01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:14.240
Such an order may be made no later

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.800
than one month from the date of

01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:19.860
final determination by the employer

01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:22.920
of the amount of damage caused

01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:24.700
by the employee.

01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:29.260
If the monthly period has expired or the

01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:32.080
employee does not agree to voluntarily

01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:33.520
compensate the employers for

01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:37.000
the damage caused, and the amount of the

01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:40.200
damage exceeds the employee's average monthly

01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:43.640
earnings, such material damage shall

01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:47.240
be reimbursed by court decision.

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:50.920
Unfortunately, employers in

01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:56.380
situations of material damage

01:35:56.390 --> 01:36:00.480
are not sufficiently protected by our legislation.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.360
There can be many different situations,

01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:06.660
and there can be many different

01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:08.020
situations.

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:11.320
For example, a rather characteristic

01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:13.800
situation describing the

01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:16.480
unprotectedness of the employer

01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:18.480
is as follows.

01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:21.540
When the shipper, having received

01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:26.400
cash in his hands to purchase some

01:36:26.410 --> 01:36:29.700
material values, calls the employer

01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:32.860
and says that he went for these values,

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.900
there was some unpleasant incident,

01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:38.160
he was robbed, the values

01:36:38.170 --> 01:36:41.980
were taken away.

01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:45.620
At the same time, the employee, having

01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:49.260
turned to the police and having

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:54.540
made a statement that he was robbed

01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:57.580
or he accidentally lost or eroded

01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:59.420
material values under some

01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:02.400
unforeseen circumstances, he

01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:04.740
will largely secure himself.

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:08.920
The maximum you can do to

01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:11.580
him is to cause damage as a result

01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:13.220
of negligence.

01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:19.820
If these amounts are insignificant,

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:21.320
then, as a rule, our

01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:24.000
law enforcement agencies will not seriously

01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:27.400
engage in the search for these

01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:29.560
funds and will not engage in

01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:31.260
serious investigation.

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.000
By small amounts I mean

01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:38.860
cash in the amount of one

01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:42.500
or several hundred thousand

01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:45.480
rubles, but naturally less.

01:37:45.490 --> 01:37:48.080
At the same time, for

01:37:48.090 --> 01:37:50.980
small, this can be quite

01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:55.060
significant for their activities,

01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:59.240
and their loss can

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:01.540
affect the enterprise

01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:04.820
in the most negative way.

01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:08.240
The only thing you will most

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:13.780
likely get in court is to recover,

01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:18.060
compensate for the damage by deducting

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:22.960
the employee’s salary that has

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:24.940
caused you the damage from

01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:26.240
the salary that he will

01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:29.400
receive at the new job if

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.420
you fired him.

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:34.720
And since salaries in our country,

01:38:34.730 --> 01:38:36.960
as a rule, official salaries

01:38:36.970 --> 01:38:39.760
are significantly different from

01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:43.960
real salaries, you will officially

01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:48.420
receive a drop of penny

01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:51.400
for many years.

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:56.460
Therefore, when you form the structure

01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:59.360
of interaction, the structure

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:04.180
of the organization of your business

01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:07.220
processes, the structure

01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:09.980
of interaction of various services,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.540
when you think about how certain

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:14.520
operations should be carried

01:39:14.530 --> 01:39:16.880
out with material resources,

01:39:16.890 --> 01:39:17.900
you should try to protect

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:19.980
yourself from such

01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:23.320
cases as possible.

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:25.820
That is, either it should

01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:29.420
be employees you trust 100%,

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:33.540
or it should be you, or

01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:37.080
that these amounts of

01:39:37.090 --> 01:39:40.420
cash, or material values

01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:42.640
that can be lost, should

01:39:42.650 --> 01:39:46.520
be small, that is, not

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.900
be critical to your

01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:51.200
business.

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:52.640
Naturally, it is desirable

01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:54.240
to carry out such operations

01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:56.580
on non-cash payment as much

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.420
as possible.

01:39:58.430 --> 01:40:00.420
In general, today, often,

01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:03.880
and this is generally a good trend,

01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:07.880
it becomes easier and safer

01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:10.760
for entrepreneurs to work

01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:13.480
as much as possible.

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:17.420
The tax burden with the maintenance

01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:21.480
of a simplified tax system has

01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:25.160
actually decreased, and if you

01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:28.020
compute your financial plans,

01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:31.640
your actions, your business

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.920
plan, then, as a rule, such a

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.380
tax burden is quite powerful

01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:41.560
for an entrepreneur who

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.420
knows how to earn money.

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:46.700
Let’s consider with you the issues

01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:50.980
of hiring key employees of your organization.

01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:53.620
The first person in the organization

01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:55.980
is, of course, the CEO, in other

01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:57.400
words, the head of

01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:59.140
the organization, because

01:40:59.150 --> 01:41:01.840
this position can be called

01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:03.380
in a different way.

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:05.900
President and so on.

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.640
It often really happens that founders, business

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:12.320
creators are more profitable to

01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:17.560
hire an experienced, competent professional

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:21.500
than to engage themselves in the

01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:23.880
development of the business,

01:41:23.890 --> 01:41:26.280
its development.

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:31.120
The effect of the work

01:41:31.130 --> 01:41:34.340
of an experienced professional,

01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:36.860
whom you know from his previous

01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:38.540
activities, from the results

01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:40.280
of activities that

01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:42.420
could really be evaluated,

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:45.880
can be much higher than the

01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:48.580
result you can by taking over

01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:52.160
the management of the organization,

01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:55.900
for its development.

01:41:55.910 --> 01:42:00.220
Therefore, when concluding a contract

01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:05.080
with such a company manager, you

01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:07.960
should clearly think

01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:10.100
about his responsibility, clearly

01:42:10.110 --> 01:42:12.520
think about those moments that

01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:17.260
will be characteristic of his effectiveness,

01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:21.420
so that in the shortest possible

01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:23.900
time you can understand whether

01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:27.720
this manager really achieves

01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:31.300
the goals you set before

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.520
the organization

01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:36.360
and before him accordingly.

01:42:36.370 --> 01:42:40.100
Of course, this is a rather complex

01:42:40.110 --> 01:42:44.040
question, and here you need to

01:42:44.050 --> 01:42:46.220
resort to the services of professionals

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.420
who can help you

01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:50.900
test this specialist.

01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:53.360
Recommendations are very important

01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:57.200
here, very important, I will repeat,

01:42:57.210 --> 01:43:00.720
those performance indicators,

01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:04.360
which you can learn from some

01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:06.060
sources, performance indicators

01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:08.140
on his previous work.

01:43:08.150 --> 01:43:10.700
And building relationships with

01:43:10.710 --> 01:43:16.240
such a leader, you must put,

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:19.740
again, clear deadlines and

01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:26.320
clear criteria for its effectiveness.

01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:29.520
That is, if you can’t evaluate

01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:32.220
something, you can’t count

01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:37.880
something, then this, with enough

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:40.800
confidence, can’t be an indicator

01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:43.860
of the effectiveness

01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:45.820
of a person’s work.

01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:50.280
In this case, it is important

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:53.100
to conclude a temporary

01:43:53.110 --> 01:43:57.480
employment contract with the manager.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.600
The law gives us

01:43:59.610 --> 01:44:01.840
this opportunity.

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.360
If you do not know this manager

01:44:06.370 --> 01:44:10.480
well enough, then it makes sense

01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:13.840
to sign a contract for a minimum

01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:15.840
period of one year.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.180
The trial period for managers

01:44:18.190 --> 01:44:21.740
is 6 months, which is the period

01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:24.460
in which you can dismiss an

01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:28.720
employee without explaining

01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:30.380
the reasons.

01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:33.780
For ordinary employees, this period

01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:35.860
is 3 months.

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.980
For the managers of the organization,

01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:42.280
for the deputy managers, for the

01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:45.080
chief accountant, this term

01:44:45.090 --> 01:44:48.080
may be 6 months, but not more.

01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:51.680
You can also, after the end

01:44:51.690 --> 01:44:54.680
of the trial period, at your wish

01:44:54.690 --> 01:44:57.620
and also actually without explaining

01:44:57.630 --> 01:45:00.880
reasons, dismiss the manager.

01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:04.200
But at the same time you will have

01:45:04.210 --> 01:45:06.500
to compensate him, pay him compensation

01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:09.040
in the amount of three monthly

01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:11.460
salaries.

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:13.640
The head of the organization

01:45:13.650 --> 01:45:19.540
can also submit a request for care

01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:22.680
at any time at his own request.

01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:25.820
He must do so at least one

01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:27.940
month before the

01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:30.600
expected period of dismissal.

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.140
The head of the organization,

01:45:34.150 --> 01:45:35.920
as I said, bears full material

01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:38.160
responsibility for the direct

01:45:38.170 --> 01:45:39.760
damage caused to the

01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:41.180
organization.

01:45:41.190 --> 01:45:43.620
In cases stipulated by federal

01:45:43.630 --> 01:45:46.000
laws, the head of the organization

01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:48.240
shall compensate for losses

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.340
caused by his guilty actions.

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:57.480
The calculation of these losses

01:45:57.490 --> 01:46:00.260
is carried out in accordance

01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:02.600
with the norms provided

01:46:02.610 --> 01:46:04.360
for by the civil law.

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:10.220
The next key person in your organization

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:13.120
is the chief accountant.

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:16.300
They are subject to similar rules

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:20.600
as the head of the organization.

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.840
And to hire a chief accountant

01:46:23.850 --> 01:46:27.080
should be approached as scrupulously

01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:30.180
as to hire a head of

01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:31.740
the organization.

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:36.260
The fact is that often

01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:38.080
beginners directly maintain

01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:41.680
a permanent chief

01:46:41.690 --> 01:46:44.540
accountant and pay

01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:46.660
him a full salary.

01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:50.040
Today, on the labour market, a

01:46:50.050 --> 01:46:52.660
more or less qualified accountant

01:46:52.670 --> 01:46:55.680
requires a salary of no

01:46:55.690 --> 01:47:00.940
less than $800 per month.

01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:05.420
Many do not have this in their power,

01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:09.600
when the company is just beginning to

01:47:09.610 --> 01:47:13.300
develop, has not yet reached the

01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:15.740
desired profitability indicators.

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.580
Therefore, many entrepreneurs

01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:22.920
hire so-called

01:47:22.930 --> 01:47:24.560
freelancers.

01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:27.540
These are accountants who work at

01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:31.040
home and carry out the accounting

01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:33.460
and tax reporting of several

01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:37.320
organizations simultaneously.

01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.280
As a rule, such accountants do not formally

01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:41.700
formalize their employment relationship

01:47:41.710 --> 01:47:44.720
with the entrepreneur.

01:47:44.730 --> 01:47:51.480
And if they are registered, they are not

01:47:51.490 --> 01:47:54.800
officially the chief accountants and do

01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:59.560
not appear in the register of tax authorities.

01:47:59.570 --> 01:48:01.700
And entrepreneurs, unfortunately,

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.000
often get into such a situation

01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:08.820
that they can not test

01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:12.500
the accountant, can not determine

01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:14.860
the level of his qualification,

01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:18.480
they agree with him on keeping

01:48:18.490 --> 01:48:21.080
accounting and tax accounting.

01:48:21.090 --> 01:48:23.100


01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.660
This accountant has been keeping

01:48:27.670 --> 01:48:30.920
accounting for three months

01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:35.420
or six months, receiving his remuneration.

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:39.160
And when some unpleasant

01:48:39.170 --> 01:48:41.240
situations arise, this accountant

01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:44.140
disappears and becomes simply

01:48:44.150 --> 01:48:46.160
inaccessible, does not contact

01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:49.200
and refuses to perform its

01:48:49.210 --> 01:48:51.860
duties and in any way to

01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:54.560
interact with the entrepreneur.

01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:56.880
The entrepreneur cannot

01:48:56.890 --> 01:49:00.140
take any action against

01:49:00.150 --> 01:49:01.080
it.

01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:02.920
In this situation, the entrepreneur

01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:05.760
usually bears significant

01:49:05.770 --> 01:49:08.780
financial losses.

01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:13.660
He has to hire other accountants

01:49:13.670 --> 01:49:17.000
to figure out what the

01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:20.680
fugitive accountant has done.

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:24.120
He has to break the mess in the relationship

01:49:24.130 --> 01:49:27.260
with the tax authorities and

01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:28.820
so on and so on.

01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:31.200
This is very unpleasant.

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.960
Unfortunately, this situation can arise

01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:37.220
not only with freelancers,

01:49:37.230 --> 01:49:41.740
but also with accountants who came to

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.440
you for a permanent job, but did not

01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:48.540
want to be officially registered as the

01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:51.520
chief accountant, so that information

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.520
about them was entered in the

01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:58.240
register of legal entities, in the

01:49:58.250 --> 01:50:02.200
register, which is in the tax inspection.

01:50:02.210 --> 01:50:04.300
Such a accountant can also

01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:08.740
sit quietly in your office,

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.640
perform basic accounting

01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:12.920
work, make payments and

01:50:12.930 --> 01:50:16.480
some invoices, bills and other

01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:19.080
primary documentation,

01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:23.660
receive their $800 and above

01:50:23.670 --> 01:50:26.300
a month, and at a critical

01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:30.000
moment can also escape.

01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:34.160
You can’t actually do anything

01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:35.760
with it either.

01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:39.640
Therefore, when hiring a chief

01:50:39.650 --> 01:50:43.140
accountant, you should try to

01:50:43.150 --> 01:50:45.800
do everything possible to determine

01:50:45.810 --> 01:50:49.400
his qualification level as reliably

01:50:49.410 --> 01:50:51.740
as possible.

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:55.640
These may be recommendations from

01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:59.280
your good acquaintances who know

01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:00.160
this person.

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:03.640
This may be the advice of other

01:51:03.650 --> 01:51:06.240
accountants you know.

01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:10.540
These may be recommendations from

01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:14.580
auditors or third parties you

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:20.140
can trust in the objectivity

01:51:20.150 --> 01:51:22.240
of their assessments.

01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:24.200
You can also contact specialists,

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:26.320
you can contact recruitment agencies

01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:29.120
that have experience in the selection

01:51:29.130 --> 01:51:33.080
of accountants, you can contact

01:51:33.090 --> 01:51:35.560
audit firms, you can simply

01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:40.100
contact your familiar accountant,

01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:42.560
who you trust, with a

01:51:42.570 --> 01:51:44.380
request to test

01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:47.500
your candidate.

01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:51.020
This will safeguard you to some extent.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.420
Today, there are quite a lot

01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:56.800
of free-to-access accounting

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:59.000
tests on the Internet

01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:01.800
and you can also

01:52:01.810 --> 01:52:03.060
use them.

01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:06.160
This is also one way.

01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:09.320
Only have to bear in mind that these

01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:12.920
accounting tests can be conditionally

01:52:12.930 --> 01:52:15.380
divided into two classes.

01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:19.500
Some refer to general accounting

01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:20.840
rules.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:25.640
Any accountant must answer to

01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:35.480
such tests with a score not less

01:52:35.490 --> 01:52:37.460
than 80 percent.

01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:41.020
Because these tests contain

01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:43.940
the basics of accounting, which

01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:46.880
is called backpoints that every

01:52:46.890 --> 01:52:49.920
accountant should know as a report.

01:52:49.930 --> 01:52:52.920
There are narrower, more

01:52:52.930 --> 01:52:55.880
specialized accounting tests and

01:52:55.890 --> 01:52:58.100
they can vary depending

01:52:58.110 --> 01:53:00.680
on the specifics of a particular

01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:02.740
business.

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.640
Of course, a accountant who

01:53:05.650 --> 01:53:10.080
has not worked for a long time in

01:53:10.090 --> 01:53:13.620
this field will not be able to

01:53:13.630 --> 01:53:17.220
respond to such tests with a high score

01:53:17.230 --> 01:53:18.420
above 80%.

01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:22.340
However, this does not mean

01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:23.980
that he is inadequate.

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:27.100
Here you need to keep in mind that a

01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:31.580
accountant, as well as a lawyer, does not

01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:36.280
need to know all the norms on the teeth.

01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:41.620
He must be able to understand them,

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:45.600
he must be able to familiarize himself

01:53:45.610 --> 01:53:48.380
with some documents, link them with

01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:51.960
other accounting norms and build

01:53:51.970 --> 01:53:55.940
a clear and competent

01:53:55.950 --> 01:53:58.780
scheme of actions.

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.260
And then such a qualified accountant

01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:11.600
will cope with those situations

01:54:11.610 --> 01:54:15.280
that he did not deal

01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:17.020
with before.

01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:21.100
Therefore, such special tests should

01:54:21.110 --> 01:54:25.380
be given to accountants when the accountant

01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:31.640
is also tested by an experienced person,

01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:33.220
preferably a accountant or

01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:36.160
an auditor, one who understands

01:54:36.170 --> 01:54:39.400
the essence of the issues.

01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:41.540
He will be able to understand whether this

01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:43.420
accountant really knows

01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:46.460
how to navigate in accounting issues

01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:49.480
and find the necessary solutions,

01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:52.440
the necessary correct answers.

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:55.140
In terms of accounting,

01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:58.280
one point that is becoming

01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:01.380
increasingly

01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:04.320
important is to be

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:05.660
noted.

01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:09.320
The fact is that today, when the

01:55:09.330 --> 01:55:14.020
opportunities for making money in banks

01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:16.180
became less, when the bank

01:55:16.190 --> 01:55:19.220
margin has significantly decreased

01:55:19.230 --> 01:55:22.020
and there is a tendency to

01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:24.760
further decline, banks

01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:28.820
have turned their face to lending

01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:30.900
small.

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:35.500
And you can get loans today for the

01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:39.460
development of small without any

01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:42.700
special obligations, without collateral

01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:44.920
in some banks.

01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:48.000
And in this situation for banking

01:55:48.010 --> 01:55:50.060
employees, for assessing

01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:53.280
your solvency, literacy in

01:55:53.290 --> 01:55:56.280
keeping your management and

01:55:56.290 --> 01:55:59.420
accounting becomes increasingly

01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:01.100
important.

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:04.720
It is important to keep not

01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:09.980
only accounting, but also financial

01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:13.260
management documentation.

01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:16.760
Even if you do not show all of

01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:20.860
the assets in your financial

01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:25.240
statements, it is reflected in

01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:28.220
your internal management financial

01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:30.520
statements.

01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:34.840
This can serve as a basis for

01:56:34.850 --> 01:56:36.720
bank employees, for credit

01:56:36.730 --> 01:56:40.460
department employees to make

01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:45.260
a decision, for or against

01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:46.380
you.

01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:50.040
That is, if they see in this

01:56:50.050 --> 01:56:52.040
documentation that you

01:56:52.050 --> 01:56:56.760
really have a normal cash flow,

01:56:56.770 --> 01:56:59.920
if they see the dynamics of

01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:03.120
business development, see

01:57:03.130 --> 01:57:06.920
some assets that you have already

01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:09.500
acquired, whether it is computers

01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:12.960
or some other equipment,

01:57:12.970 --> 01:57:15.500
even if you have not put it

01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:17.460
on the balance sheet, then

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.900
they will most likely

01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:22.300
make a positive decision

01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:24.860
about your lending.

01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:27.520
In general, in all relationships

01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:32.440
with your employees you need to be

01:57:32.450 --> 01:57:35.560
as specific and clear as possible

01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:38.460
on all issues.

01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:41.520
This is the distribution of duties, and

01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:44.980
writing instructions, and keeping documentation,

01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:49.500
and the distribution of tasks.

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:52.960
The more clearly you write all

01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:55.240
this in the instructions,

01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:58.200
in the work regulations, the easier

01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:01.900
it will be for you to work, the easier

01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:04.620
it will be for you to control the

01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:06.820
work of your employees, to

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.900
evaluate their effectiveness and

01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:13.220
the less conflict situations

01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:14.720
you will have.

01:58:14.730 --> 01:58:19.240
The fact is that when the manager gives

01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:23.490
a task to another employee, often

01:58:23.590 --> 01:58:26.070
there is a situation that the manager

01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.590
meant one thing, the employee

01:58:28.810 --> 01:58:30.790
understood another.

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:33.230
Every person has their own

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:36.070
perception, and you need to remember

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:39.010
about it, you need to make a discount

01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:43.630
on it, and therefore you should

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:47.290
be in all your tasks, in all

01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:49.990
relationships with employees to

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.830
be as accurate as possible and

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:55.370
try to get feedback.

01:58:55.380 --> 01:59:00.130
In addition, the instructions of the

01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:03.130
office can greatly help you avoid

01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:05.370
unpleasant situations in

01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:07.350
the relationship with the

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.590
supervisory authorities, because

01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:12.390
if in your instructions of

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:16.050
the employee were assigned certain

01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:17.390
duties, and the employee

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:21.330
did not fulfill them, and the

01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:24.050
supervisory authorities make claims

01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:27.550
to you on certain issues, then

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.210
you, referring to this

01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:33.190
instruction, can secure

01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:38.050
yourself from a certain

01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.470
share of responsibility for

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:43.450
those actions, for which

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:44.830
you are claimed.

01:59:45.230 --> 01:59:46.730
This responsibility

01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:48.730
by the supervisory authorities

01:59:48.740 --> 01:59:51.570
may be entrusted to the employee

01:59:52.170 --> 01:59:54.250
who had to perform the necessary

01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:56.270
actions on his official

01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:57.770
instructions.

01:59:58.170 --> 01:59:59.970
I would also like to address

01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:03.270
some principles of

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.890
business safety.

02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:09.330
They again concern the registration

02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:11.410
of legal documents, both contractual

02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:15.250
and taxation, accounts,

02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:18.710
invoices and other financial documents.

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:21.990
Unfortunately, it is still necessary

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.130
to face this situation,

02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:27.330
especially in markets where there

02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:30.170
is a certain product deficit,

02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:33.470
when entrepreneurs, wishing to get

02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:38.970
some goods at a favorable price

02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:43.770
faster, do not pay due attention

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:47.530
to the verification of documents

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:51.410
provided by the seller of

02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:52.490
the goods.

02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:56.050
Businesses are still burning

02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:56.610
on it.

02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:00.030
Therefore, in all relationships with

02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:04.350
your partners, do not hesitate to

02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.030
check the authority of employees

02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:11.510
of your contractors, do not hesitate

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:16.070
to check the founding documents, companies

02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.710
with which you interact

02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:20.230
and clearly control the

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:23.210
deadlines and other arrangements

02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:25.790
reached by you.

02:01:26.010 --> 02:01:28.250
This will help you avoid unpleasant

02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.150
situations.

02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:34.110
We had such a precedent not so

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:36.890
long ago, when we were approached

02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:40.150
by entrepreneurs who paid for

02:01:40.930 --> 02:01:44.750
some deficit of goods, raw materials,

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:46.990
once only talking live with the

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.570
sellers and actually received a

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:56.730
bill for payment of this deficit

02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:59.150
of raw materials.

02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:01.910
It is natural to assume that in

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:04.450
this situation their contractors

02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:06.750
could be fraudsters.

02:02:07.190 --> 02:02:09.030
It really happened.

02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:12.630
They removed the office for a

02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:15.410
short period of time, they accepted

02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:17.410
potential buyers in this office, they

02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:20.170
negotiated with them, then they

02:02:20.370 --> 02:02:24.090
gave them a bill and after receiving

02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:27.050
the money they disappeared.

02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:29.690
This became possible precisely because

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:33.470
entrepreneurs, buyers did not check

02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:38.110
the powers of these persons, did

02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:39.890
not check their constituent documents,

02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:43.390
and at all behaved completely

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:44.850
unchecked.

02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:49.230
This is more like a story

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:53.670
about some 90s, about the

02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:56.170
beginning of commercial relations

02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:59.990
in Russia, but in reality

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.330
it is now quite common,

02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:05.210
so be careful.

02:03:07.210 --> 02:03:09.910
The next point of our program is the

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:11.170
relationship with the

02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:12.710
supervisory authorities.

02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:15.290
These include tax inspection,

02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:17.510
extra-budgetary funds, customs,

02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:20.450
police, trade inspection,

02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:24.050
CSA, labour inspection and some

02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.930
other more specific

02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:29.650
bodies that have the right

02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:32.090
to control one or another

02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:34.290
activity of entrepreneurs.

02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:36.710
In all relationships with these bodies,

02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:39.470
a very important principle is also.

02:03:39.710 --> 02:03:42.050
Conscious means protected.

02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:47.550
The better you know your rights and responsibilities,

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:50.670
the easier it is for you to interact

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:53.250
with them, the less risks you

02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:54.650
are taking.

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.790
One of the most serious forms

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:04.930
of liability that an enterprise

02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:06.530
bears is administrative

02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:09.210
liability.

02:04:09.370 --> 02:04:11.890
Administrative responsibility is

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:16.050
imposed on the head of the organization.

02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:17.990
If it is an individual

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.010
entrepreneur, then

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:20.290
directly to him.

02:04:22.190 --> 02:04:24.090
This responsibility is more

02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:26.410
serious than the responsibility

02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:30.670
of the founders of an LLC or a joint-

02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:33.030
stock company or any other

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.210
legal entity.

02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:36.230
Because, as we have said, with the

02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:39.290
minimum charter capital, the founders

02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:43.390
do not actually risk anything.

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.190
Administrative liability may be imposed

02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:48.290
for various violations of the legislation,

02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:51.650
and for violation of the deadlines

02:04:52.010 --> 02:04:54.430
for submitting accounting reports,

02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.710
and for violation of the provisions

02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:00.290
and rules of the SS, and

02:05:00.630 --> 02:05:02.270
the like.

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:06.130
This responsibility is imposed

02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:08.970
by officials and must be fulfilled.

02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:10.970


02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:14.450
Avoiding it is quite difficult.

02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:20.070
Therefore, to protect yourself,

02:05:21.090 --> 02:05:23.830
you must, as I said, first of all,

02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:26.990
very clearly write down all your

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.390
relationships with employees,

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:32.110
all official instructions,

02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:37.430
and know and comply with all

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.330
the norms of relevant laws

02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:44.190
and other regulations.

02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:46.330
In relations with

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:50.090
all supervisory authorities,

02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.450
it is of great importance how

02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:57.910
confident you feel about

02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:01.150
the specifics of a particular

02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:02.290
activity.

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:04.650
The fact is that very controlling

02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:06.490
authorities, especially our brave

02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:08.650
militia, like to take what is

02:06:08.710 --> 02:06:11.650
called a whistle-up, to scare.

02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:14.450
And the entrepreneur is not

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:18.750
prepared enough, he is lost

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:23.490
and often gives himself and brings

02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:26.890
even greater trouble

02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:29.570
to himself than they really

02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:30.130
are.

02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:35.530
Therefore, if you know your rights

02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:39.050
and duties clearly, know the laws

02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.390
well, you will feel more confident

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:47.710
and you will be able to calmly and

02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:52.070
skillfully object to your controllers.

02:06:52.090 --> 02:06:53.970
As practice shows, controllers

02:06:54.230 --> 02:06:56.630
in such a situation begin to

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:00.390
respect you more, they are said

02:07:00.490 --> 02:07:02.570
to be sedentary, calmed down,

02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:06.370
and your conversation with them

02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:09.990
will be built more constructively.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.210
As a result, you will lose less

02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:17.570
money and your business

02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:19.830
will be less exposed

02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:21.070
to risks.

02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:24.530
Therefore, again, the

02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:28.690
entrepreneur should know all

02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:31.650
the main regulatory acts that

02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.710
relate to his activity.

02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:39.470
Don’t be lazy to study them, there are not so many.

02:07:40.090 --> 02:07:41.910
For each business activity there

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.730
is its own limited range

02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:46.230
of these normative legal acts,

02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:49.970
and their knowledge will help you.

02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:52.370
This is where our course is finished.

02:07:52.650 --> 02:07:53.890
Thanks for your attention.

02:07:54.930 --> 02:07:57.830
We hope that it will help you

02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:59.390
feel more confident in the

02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:01.710
jungle of Russian business.

02:08:01.730 --> 02:08:02.430
Success to you!
