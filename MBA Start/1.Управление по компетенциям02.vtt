00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Planning a project.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
First, clarifying the goal.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Why does our company need a competence model?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
How will this model be used?

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
How interested are top managers, management, and shareholders in the project?

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Second, time resources.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
How much time do we have?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Third, creating a project.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Who will lead the project?

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
How many people will be included in the working group?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Who will collect and analyze the information?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Why do you need this?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
How will your company use it?

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Who will join your project group and team?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Try to formulate and answer these questions.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
This will be a good foundation for the future project.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Let's move on to the next stage.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Designing a competence model.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
As I said, this is the most time-consuming and laborious stage.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Because we need to collect the information and analyze it.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
The result of this stage is the formation of a list of competencies.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
So, collecting information.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Our goals.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
First, we need to collect examples of behavior standards that ensure effective performance.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
Second, we need to determine the standards that may be required for effective performance in the future.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Where can we get this information?

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
We need to understand how the company works today.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
What behavior, working behavior is stimulated by the company today.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
What actions lead to effective performance of the work.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
First of all, we have a number of sources from which we can get this information.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Some sources answer the question who.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
The other part answers the question what.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
If we talk about who can help us with this.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
First, the employees themselves.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Of course.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
We can ask the employees how they do their job.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
How do they achieve results?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
What do they do to achieve these results?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
We can ask employees about their colleagues.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
We can ask questions to managers.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
We can ask questions to clients.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
If we work in the service business in the B2C sphere.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
We can ask questions to partners.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
If they work with us for a long time, they can answer the questions.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
What behavior, what actions do they evaluate as excellent?

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
The next important source of information that is often forgotten is mentors and coaches.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
They should be asked.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
If they are mentors in production, their job is to prepare and train young and not very specialists.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
The same with coaches.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
If we have a training center, the programs are developed to improve the professionalism of our employees.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
To develop their professional competencies.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
These are the people, these are the categories of employees that you need to start with.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
And, by the way, involve in the design team.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
The next part of the sources answers the question what.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
What are the documents?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
What documents?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Of course, it all depends on what documents we have.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
But it is important to remember that there is always a number of documents at the level of the entire enterprise.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Someone has a strategic plan, a business plan.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
These are formulated strategic goals if it is a public company.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
This is a mission, this is a corporate code, and so on.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
It is clear that there are companies where there is nothing.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
There are companies where everything is, but nothing works.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
We must approach the tools that are used by employees in their daily activities.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
Thus, documents at the company level, documents at the division level, and documents at the employee level.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
This is a professional manual, for example.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Some reminders, recommendations, and so on.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Maybe a professional manual, someone will say that professional manuals do not work.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
They are written many years ago, and only guests from the labor inspection are waiting.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
This is definitely true.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
But even in such companies, for example, there may be a certain reminder to the cashier how to work with the buyers.

04:38.000 --> 04:48.000
From this reminder, we will draw information on what standards of behavior, from the point of view of us, from the point of view of our company,

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
ensure the effective performance of the work of the cashier, that is, the quality of service of the buyers and visitors.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
So, we have determined the sources that are at our disposal.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Now a few words about the methods of collecting information.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
There are various methods.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
This can be an analysis of the work or monitoring of the employee's activities.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
This can be conducting surveys or interviews.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
Conducting focus groups, brainstorming, working groups with employees and managers.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
It is important for us to understand what methods are applicable in our particular case to work with a certain group of employees.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
It is clear that we can use the observation method, for example, for the seller in the trading room.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
But we will not be able to monitor the accountant in any way to collect the standards of behavior that he uses in his work.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Conducting surveys.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
The survey is a very difficult thing.

05:53.000 --> 06:06.000
And to formulate complex and incomprehensible questions about what qualities should an employee have to be successful in this position in a certain survey sheet,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
well, it is possible, but probably not what is necessary.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
Because by filling in such survey sheets, employees can simply unsubscribe and we will not get the valid information that we need.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
The best way is an interview.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
This is a conversation.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
This is a situation when we prepare the questions that we need.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
Even if we somehow, by guiding questions, bring the employee to the answers that we need,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
we get the information that we need.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
In addition to the interview, the next most frequently used tool is holding work groups.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Work groups within one unit.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Work groups for, say, a one-level manager.

06:52.000 --> 07:02.000
Work groups for employees of two units, so that they can evaluate each other if they are very active in their activities, actively interact.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
There are several other methods that help us a lot when carrying out this project.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
This is the method of repertory grids, the method of critical incidents, the method of direct attributes.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Let's open them up and see what it is.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
The method of repertory grids is as follows.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
The head of the unit fills out a certain table.

07:21.000 --> 07:32.000
We can imagine the information in the form of such a table, in which the names of his subordinates are listed vertically.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
There may be key employees if the unit is very large.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
And on top are listed the skills and qualities that are required for successful work.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
The head of the unit fills out and describes how each of the subordinates demonstrates the skills and qualities that are necessary.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
It turns out that someone does well.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
For example, if this is the head of the sales department and he fills out this table for sales managers,

08:01.000 --> 08:10.000
we see that someone best establishes and establishes partnerships with the client, establishes relations.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
He best negotiates phone meetings.

08:14.000 --> 08:23.000
Another employee does the presentation best, because he knows the product, benefits, benefits, products or services.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Someone works great with objections.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Thus, we get a certain grid.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
Therefore, the method of repertory grids, in which various examples of behavior of employees are listed,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
among which we can choose how successful they are.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And it is not necessary that they will belong to someone.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
And not really.

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
Thus, we are the developers of this project, we get a certain matrix with behavior standards.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
It is important to help the manager when filling out such tables, such grids,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
or to explain very well how and what he needs to do.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
Because later we will check the behavior standards that she determines during the working game,

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
in which those employees may be present, who were described in this table.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The same manager will be present, possibly clients.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
Thus, by collecting information, we will constantly check its validity during the entire stage.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
How valuable, how objective information we have.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
The next method is the method of critical incidents,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
which allows us to determine the behavioral reactions,

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
which were important in a certain critical situation.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
We organize and conduct a structured interview for employees, their managers, their colleagues,

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
asking questions and asking them to tell about the situation,

09:54.000 --> 10:04.000
about some real case in which a serious mistake was made or an important success was achieved,

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
and about what actions they took, how they behaved in order to make it happen,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
or vice versa, if there was a mistake, what they did not do in that case,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
and how they can evaluate it now.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
The next method is the method of direct attributes.

10:22.000 --> 10:32.000
Within this method, the linear managers are offered a description of the ready-made competencies.

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
We ask them to evaluate them, compare these competencies in pairs,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
to determine the most important ones from their point of view.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
This method is good to use in case when you have already formulated competencies,

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
when you have already gone a long way for some kind of testing,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
because it will be very interesting if the competencies that you have recognized as important

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
are not chosen by the top managers and they will say that this is not the most important thing in our activity,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
this is a kind of verification.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
We have said several times that we conduct interviews or work groups.

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
It is important to determine what questions we ask our employees or managers.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
After all, you will get such an answer when you ask a question,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
but we need a definite answer, we need an answer about standard behaviors.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So, what are we asking?

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
We always formulate a list of questions at home, we are always preparing for this.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
As an example, what kind of question can it be?

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
For example, we can ask what qualities should an employee have to be successful in his or her position?

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
And in response to this question, we will get a list of qualities, characteristics,

11:47.000 --> 11:56.000
something from the field of knowledge, about what is necessary for success in the position that we are analyzing.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Our next question will sound like this.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
And how will this actually manifest itself at the behavioral level?

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
After all, if competence is behavior, then again, it is not enough to know something and be able to do something, you need to do it.

12:07.000 --> 12:15.000
Therefore, the next question we ask our employees is about the language of behavior.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
How will this be expressed in the daily activities of an employee?

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
The next question that must be asked is whether the selected competencies are really important.

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
After all, maybe these competencies are in the employees' units, but this is not the most priority for the performance of the position.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
It's good that there is, it's good that we have it, but the priority is important to define competently.

12:44.000 --> 12:54.000
The next important question is whether we can and how we will collect information in order to evaluate an employee on these competencies.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
For example, very often companies define such competence as loyalty.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
This is a very valuable competence, most often it is related to the category of corporate.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
But very often the company says, it is important for our employees to be loyal to us.

13:10.000 --> 13:20.000
But only then this competence can be recognized, can be, let's say, accepted and voiced as their corporate competencies.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
When you have decided for yourself, how will you understand whether an employee is loyal or not loyal?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
He says about it, maybe he says, but he is not loyal.

13:28.000 --> 13:37.000
And someone is silent, frowning, but in his actions he shows a high level of loyalty.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
This is necessary to answer these questions at the stage of collecting information.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Will we be able to collect or not? How will we collect it?

13:45.000 --> 13:54.000
Because later, having this information, it will be easier for us to formulate the competencies that we will choose as the main ones and include them in the corporate model.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
The next step in this stage is the analysis of information.

14:00.000 --> 14:09.000
If we did everything right and did everything qualitatively, we collected a large amount of information.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
And what do we need to do? We need to analyze what is priority and what is not.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
And develop a general structure of the competence model, the priorities that are necessary.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
My recommendation is that work is most often done within the framework of additional working groups,

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
which are made up of the most active participants who have shown themselves at the stage of collecting information.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
My recommendation is to duplicate the work.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
What does this mean?

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
This means that you conduct one, two, or even three working groups that are dedicated to the same issue.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
It is necessary to develop a list of competencies.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And the same list of competencies is developed by all three groups,

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
so that later, having presented their results to each other again, they can discuss and come to a consensus.

14:59.000 --> 15:08.000
This method works very well when you work with a group of linear managers and formulate corporate competencies.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
By dividing linear managers into several groups and suggesting each group to determine the corporate competencies

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
that you will include in the future model, you will see how managers,

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
first joining the work within their group, will then either protect their developments or accept others'.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
But in any case, you should reach a compromise by discussing it within the entire team.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
Therefore, we must duplicate the analytical work.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
After that, we discuss.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
After that, we choose a name.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
The name should be short and concise.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
After all, as you name the ship, it will sail.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
Therefore, the name of the competency should characterize its future content as much as possible.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
It is important to understand that each company is unique and each company has its own language.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
There are many disputes about the competence of leadership, for example.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
Some companies declare this competence as corporate, required for all employees.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
Others define this competence as managerial, that is, a competence for managers.

16:17.000 --> 16:26.000
Some say that leadership is a concept that cannot be measured, and a person was born a leader or not.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
There are no right or wrong.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
It is important to understand how we have determined this competence.

16:32.000 --> 16:40.000
And if we talk about leadership, we describe a competent leader and, in fact, we fill it with the definition of the competence of working with people,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
managing people or managing employees, managing a team.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Teams are our own choice.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
What we call, what we define is only our choice.

16:51.000 --> 17:02.000
Thus, competencies that are called the same in different companies can have completely different meanings and describe completely different behavior.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
At this stage, it is necessary to eliminate repetitions.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Competences, which is important, should not intersect.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
What does it mean to intersect?

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
As an example, a company defines competence as professionalism.

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
Let's start with the fact that this competence is not quite clear, because professionalism is like a professional competence.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
But there are companies that take it to the corporate level.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
We are all professionals.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
There is also a competence, for example, as an orientation to development.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
We value those who study, we study ourselves, we create an environment in which our employees study.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
On the one hand, these are two different competencies.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
But on the other hand, you always need to understand what professionalism is.

17:48.000 --> 17:58.000
Professionalism, when it is defined as a corporate competence, that is, for all employees, and does not carry some narrowly specialized orientation,

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
most often under professionalism, the ability to learn, the desire to learn, to develop, and so on, is understood.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
It may turn out that we are talking about the same thing, although competencies are called differently.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
How to check?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It is very simple.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
You need to find an employee who has, and in general, answer the question, can it be so in our company,

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
when an employee has one competence and does not have a second competence.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
Let's say, when he is very professional, but absolutely oriented to development.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
In that case, if we intersect these competencies, we will answer for ourselves, this cannot be.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
And if this cannot be, then most likely the competencies are the same.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
Can we check another competence, the orientation to development and the team player?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Are these competencies different or similar?

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
We must remember a person who is oriented to development, who is drawn to knowledge, but is not a team player.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Can it be so?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Of course it can.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
And vice versa.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.000
A person who is a team player, who, let's say, sets the goals of the team above his own, but at the same time is absolutely not oriented to development.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
It can be so.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
And it can be so.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
Thus, these competencies do not intersect, and we can include both of these competencies in our model.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
The next thing we do at this stage is to check validity.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
What does it mean?

19:19.000 --> 19:27.000
It means that every time we understand and look at, let's say, those lights, that compass, we are going the right way.

19:27.000 --> 19:37.000
Are the employees who demonstrate competence really doing their job more effectively than those who do not demonstrate?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
What does it mean?

19:38.000 --> 19:48.000
It means that are the competencies that we have recognized as priority really owned by those employees who are successful today?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It should be so.

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
If it is somehow different, and we made a mistake and took the wrong direction, and prioritized the wrong competencies,

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
it will turn out that we will somehow get off the road on a certain path, which is not yet clear where it will lead.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
Therefore, at the stage of the demo, we always test and check.

20:10.000 --> 20:17.000
After all, we wrote it down and took these behavior standards from the activities of the same best employees.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
In fact, our circle will close and everything should match.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But it is necessary to check every time.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
Because if we define other priorities for our company, it means that we will simply lead the company in a different direction.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
That we will stimulate and develop some other behavior.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
This can only be in one case, if the company strategy has changed.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
If yesterday we were aggressive, seized the market, we valued competencies, let's say, from this area,

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
and today we said, that's it, the market is at our feet, we are improving the quality, we are talking about the service, and so on.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
In this case, there may be a departure from the main road to another road.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
But only if we understand this initially and set it up initially.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
In case there were no such drastic changes in our strategy, then again.

21:07.000 --> 21:17.000
Those competencies that we have defined must necessarily correspond to the behavior that our effective employees show in their work today.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
As we have already said, the result of this stage is a formulated list of competencies.

21:23.000 --> 21:33.000
Let's look at the slides, on which a number of examples with corporate competencies of various companies are given.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Let's look and comment on them.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
What will we see?

21:37.000 --> 21:47.000
At the first stage, we see a model of competencies, consisting of 11 competencies, which are divided into 3 clusters.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
Under the clusters, competencies can be combined into one group.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Here we see 3 clusters.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Business development, achievement of results, work with people.

21:56.000 --> 22:04.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that here we do not see a list of professional, administrative and corporate competencies.

22:04.000 --> 22:11.000
But most likely, work with people will be administrative competencies or, at least, leadership competencies.

22:11.000 --> 22:22.000
Administrative competencies will include business vision and setting goals from the achievement of results cluster.

22:23.000 --> 22:33.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the presentation of a model of competencies, its final formulation, is always our choice.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
It is how we define it.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
In the next slide, we see a model of competencies, which includes 8 competencies,

22:42.000 --> 22:53.000
among which 3 corporate competencies, 3 administrative competencies and 3 professional competencies for sales department employees, as indicated in the slide.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
Next, a model of competencies is given, which is called a model of leadership competencies.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
It consists of 16 competencies, divided into 5 clusters.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
It is a question of the limit of competencies.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
Once again, there should be as many competencies as you can work with.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
There are examples where competencies can be 4 or 5.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
There can be competencies for employees or for leaders.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
Once again, this choice is made by each company, depending on what goals it set for itself at the very beginning,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
for what tasks competencies were developed.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
The more competencies a model contains, the more difficult it is to apply.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
It is difficult to identify specific competencies in an excessively detailed model,

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
since the differences between individual competencies in such a model can be incredibly small.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
Therefore, do not chase a large number, do not say about it, well, to yourself, yes,

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
I warn you that we can have 20, or 18, or 15.

24:02.000 --> 24:12.000
Formulate 10, but for workers, which you will use and apply in all policies and procedures of staff management.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
You will use it during selection, during evaluation events,

24:16.000 --> 24:24.000
those competencies for which you develop development methods and will develop them with employees.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
Our next stage, the fourth stage, is the development of the level of competencies models.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
At this stage, we solve several tasks.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
First, we determine how many levels our competencies will have.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
What options can be here?

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
First, it happens that competencies can be undetailed, they can be simple.

24:49.000 --> 24:58.000
Thus, the company sets a certain level, a certain behavior that is necessary for the company employees.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Let's go back to the loyalty, which we have already talked a little about.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Loyalty can be difficult to break down by levels.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
The initial level, the level of development, the level of skill, and so on.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
The company simply determines that a loyal employee for us is the employee who does not harm the company in his actions.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Let him not shout at every corner about us, he does not walk all in the attributes and logos of the company,

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
but he behaves ethically towards the company,

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
and even if he is dissatisfied or does not understand some decisions, he does not speak about it right and left.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
This is a minimum.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
This is a simple undetailed competence.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
But most often, companies develop competencies at the level.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
For what?

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
In order to understand what is needed to take the next step.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
Development programs are developed for the achievement of the next level.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
The question is, how many levels should there be?

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
You answer this question yourself, because there are no standard answers.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
It can be four levels, it can be three levels, it can be seven levels.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
In my practice, I have come across companies that have a seven-level model of competence,

26:12.000 --> 26:19.000
consisting of 10 competencies, which works great, because everything is very specific, clear and labeled by level.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Therefore, how many?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Most often, four are determined.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
You can meet three or four levels.

26:27.000 --> 26:36.000
The next important step is to determine the minimum and maximum level of competence development.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
Let's look at the following slides with examples of various competencies.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Let's take the example of competence of working with clients.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
We can see that this competence consists of four levels.

26:51.000 --> 27:00.000
The first level sounds like the level of competence development that corresponds to this level.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
It can find a common language with people, it can negotiate with a manager or a colleague,

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
but it is limited in making decisions about working with clients.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
Can this behavior be sufficient for a position in our organization?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yes, it can.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
It can be a novice sales specialist.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
Thus, we understand that this first level is a working level, acceptable for us.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
What about the first level of competence and perseverance?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Let's look at the first level, the level of development.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
This employee may refuse a planned action plan when facing difficulties.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
In some cases, his projects and plans remain unfinished.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
He does not strive to overcome obstacles in achieving goals,

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
and the difficulties that arise may stop him from achieving his plans.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Can such an employee be in our company?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Of course, he can.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Can this behavior be desirable for a position?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Most likely, no.

28:00.000 --> 28:08.000
Thus, we can see that despite the fact that in the competence and perseverance we see three levels of development,

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
we understand that the first level is a non-working level,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
it will never be acceptable for any position.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
There will be two working levels, the level of competence and the level of skill.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
Thus, this is an example of a three-level model with two working levels.

28:26.000 --> 28:36.000
The previous competence, the work with clients, is an example of a four-level competence with four working levels.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Therefore, we need to determine what the first level will be.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
Will it be positive or negative and insufficient?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
How do our colleagues answer this question?

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
In fact, it is easier to start with working levels,

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
as in the example of competence and work with clients.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
This way we will make our lives a little easier

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
and will not formulate the zero non-working level for all competencies in our model.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
But we will understand that if this is the first level,

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
then we will always have a zero in our work,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
when the competence is not developed,

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
when even this is not required at the initial level.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
Then we will not mark anything and will understand it for ourselves.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
Other companies say that they will define it so that it is clear,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
so that it is working,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
so that we explain to everyone that if it does not correspond,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
then do not mark anything at all,

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
or do not put it on the axis if we depict it in the form of a graph, and so on.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
I formulate this zero level for all non-working competencies.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
It is undesirable, not for any position.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
Therefore, we answer this question again.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
We are talking about determining the minimum,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
the acceptable minimum level.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
The following we define.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
What is the most desirable for us?

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
What will be the fourth level or the level of skill?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
It is very important not to overestimate,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
that there are no such people at all,

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
and there will never be, but we have formulated it for ourselves.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
It is better to take it from a certain practice,

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
or from those strong specialists who exist.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
We can say that these are our standards,

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
and we would like all our employees to be treated in the same way.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
Or if we do not have such specialists for any reason,

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
then we define a certain maximum level,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
but again, we try to remain as objective as possible.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
So that there are such positions where this level would be required,

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
and it would be possible to develop or find a person with such a level of competence.

30:54.000 --> 31:04.000
And again, the next and again mandatory step is to check the validity or value of the level of competence relative to real activity.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
After all, having determined the levels, the next step will be to form the profiles of positions.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
And therefore, we will arrange all our positions with you relative to those levels.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Take several positions from different areas for the sake of example,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
and impose on those levels whether it works or not.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
It turns out objectively or it turns out somehow strange,

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
that, for example, all employees should have the highest level of development in several positions.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Maybe something has not been worked out,

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
maybe the levels that you have determined in the competencies themselves do not correspond to each other.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
For example, by revealing the competence of orientation to development,

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
you took a very big step between levels.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
And by revealing the competence of teamwork, you took small steps.

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
And, accordingly, the competencies are not valid relative to each other.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
This is again and again necessary to check.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
Check how? By the example of real positions that exist in the company.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
Apply, analyze and understand whether they correspond or not.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
The next step.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Well, the next step is a kind of reward.

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
And only those who have not turned the way at the stage of formulating the list,

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
at the third and fourth stages of level development.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
At this stage, we form competencies profiles for specific positions.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Our goals.

32:32.000 --> 32:41.000
First, we need to check how competencies exactly correspond to all the working roles that exist in the company.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
How do we do it?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
We do not do it on our own.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
It is important that the line managers do it.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
The managers of those units for which we form positions.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
If the line manager understands how to do it, then we have developed a convenient model.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
If he does not understand, then we work with him together,

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
helping and necessarily getting feedback from him.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
If some competence, let's say, he cannot determine it,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
then maybe it is not the most important competence.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
We get answers to these questions during this stage.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
Ideally, we need to make profiles of those positions

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
for which we will conduct evaluation events.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
This is the beginning. This is the first and most important.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
That is, this project must be completed by developing the profile of positions.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
Ideally, this is the development of the profile of positions for all the positions of our company.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
I would like to draw your attention to the following slides,

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
on which the profile of the position of the regional representative is given.

33:51.000 --> 33:58.000
On two different slides, you see two options for presenting the profile of the position.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
It can be either in the form of a table,

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
in which the level of development is indicated.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
In fact, with such a table, you come to the linear manager

34:10.000 --> 34:18.000
and offer to determine and create a profile for the position of his division.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
When there is a list of competencies,

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
and when there is a description of each of the levels for each competence.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
And by and large, the manager, reading, understands what corresponds,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
what he would like to correspond.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Another option is in the form of a web, in the form of a certain schedule.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
This web is very convenient to use,

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
because at first we can put the required level of development on it,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
or the very profile of the position.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And after conducting evaluation procedures,

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
we put aside the current level of development of the competencies of our employees.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
And we can clearly see where there are some gaps.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Let's think.

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
In our example, there are 11 competencies.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
If the level of development for each of the three competencies is lower,

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
it means that we can clearly see and understand

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
that these are the competencies that require development,

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
and that under these competencies it is necessary to form development plans.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Or vice versa.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
When the current level of the employee exceeds the required level,

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
then it is a signal to us that this employee needs to be retained.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Or we include him in the personnel reserve.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
But there are not always companies with the opportunity to include employees in the personnel reserve.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Therefore, in any case, we must understand

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
that the level of development of the competence of an employee is very high,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
and we need to use it.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
We can involve him as a mentor,

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
as a functional coach in our training project for other employees.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
In any case, this is a signal to us that the employee needs to be retained.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
Unfortunately, this is the contradiction of our life.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
First, we invest in the development of the competence of our employees.

36:10.000 --> 36:16.000
If we are successful, then we invest in maintaining this employee in our company,

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
if we are interested in him.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
So, we talked about our main actions at various stages of the project

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
on the development of the competence model.

36:26.000 --> 36:33.000
We talked about the stage of preparation of the project itself and the formation of the project team.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
We talked about what we do, what we collect and analyze information

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
at the stage of formulating the list of competencies.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
The next stage is the development of the level of the competence model.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
And it all ends with the fact that we develop the profiles of the positions.
