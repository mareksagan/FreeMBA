00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What are the elements of your strategy?

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Global marketing strategy in the 21st century.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
What elements should your strategy contain?

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
Or what aspects should you think about to make your company successful?

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
The first element is a clear shift.

00:34.000 --> 00:49.000
The shift is that the units of strategic planning are more and more often represented by regional or global markets.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
What examples can we see?

00:52.000 --> 01:01.000
First, we can see that there are industries whose markets are global in nature.

01:01.000 --> 01:16.000
For example, the aircraft industry market, where there are a limited number of customers who have more or less similar requirements.

01:16.000 --> 01:27.000
Thus, the supplier can consider this market as global and no longer divide the countries.

01:27.000 --> 01:36.000
The second situation is that companies are gradually starting to focus on the global market.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
These are some specific segments.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
For example, global teenagers.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
This segment is considered one of the most attractive.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
Why? Because it has a number of people comparable to China's population.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
There are about 1.3 billion teenagers.

02:04.000 --> 02:20.000
This group has good financial capabilities due to the fact that their parents provide them with pocket money.

02:20.000 --> 02:31.000
We see that companies like Coca-Cola, MTV, and Svoch are actively using the services of this segment.

02:31.000 --> 02:44.000
Another example is the emergence of national marketing, in particular, the emergence of Muslim marketing.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Here we see how LG used this opportunity.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
They invented the first so-called Muslim mobile phone.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
It is different from the usual one because it has a built-in compass.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Therefore, a person can turn to the East during prayer.

03:05.000 --> 03:18.000
The second aspect that you should pay attention to today, while developing your strategy, is the coordination of the marketing strategy with production and logistics distribution.

03:18.000 --> 03:27.000
It is worth paying attention to Inditex and one of its most famous brands, the Zara retail chain.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Zara successfully coordinates all three elements.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Let's start with the fact that Zara listens to the market very carefully.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
How does it listen to the market?

03:40.000 --> 03:49.000
First of all, the company's designers are present at all fashion shows, whether in Milan, Paris, or New York.

03:49.000 --> 04:00.000
The company closely monitors various publications in the fashion press, TV stories.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
It sends its experts to the places of the fashion youth.

04:07.000 --> 04:16.000
A very important element of the company's ear is the Zara retail chain.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
This allows the company to really understand consumers.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
Moreover, Zara has a much smaller percentage of unsuccessful products than the average industry.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
1% versus 10%.

04:32.000 --> 04:42.000
Despite the fact that the company offers about 11,000 names to the market annually versus 2-3 in the industry.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
In addition, the company does it much faster than its competitors.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
Zara is able to deliver its collection to its stores twice a week.

04:54.000 --> 05:09.000
The full development of the design and production takes 4-5 months versus 6 months for the development of the design and 3 months for production.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
We see that the company is already winning over its competitors.

05:15.000 --> 05:32.000
In addition, the processes of delivery of finished products from the distribution center, which is located in Spain, are very well laid out.

05:32.000 --> 05:47.000
Logistics inside Europe takes a maximum of 24 hours, outside Europe 36 hours.

05:47.000 --> 06:01.000
Everything is built on the fact that the company has the opportunity to present its consumer with a modern design much faster than its competitors.

06:01.000 --> 06:12.000
The third important aspect is the ability to transfer skills, knowledge, and experience across national markets.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Here is a very curious example of a company like Levi Strauss.

06:17.000 --> 06:28.000
In particular, the company collects its managers from all over the world twice a year.

06:28.000 --> 06:41.000
They have the opportunity to exchange ideas, skills, and models that could have been developed for a certain national market.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
They have the opportunity to gradually transfer to other country markets.

06:50.000 --> 06:58.000
The next element of the global marketing strategy is the creation of a coordinated brand architecture for international markets.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
This is a very difficult task.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
We see that a company like Unilever has been going for a long time.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
This led to the fact that by the end of the 1990s, the portfolio of company brands had risen to 1,600.

07:15.000 --> 07:24.000
This led to significant increases in costs and an increasing difficulty in managing such a machine.

07:24.000 --> 07:45.000
What we are seeing now, or rather, this process began at the beginning of the century, is that companies that initially appeared on the market through absorption and accumulation of brands in their portfolios

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
gradually began to get rid of brands.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
In particular, Unilever has already managed to reduce its portfolio by four times.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And it seems that this is not the limit.

07:56.000 --> 08:08.000
This significantly facilitates management and increases the profits of this portfolio.

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
The next important aspect of the global marketing strategy is the change in the relationship in marketing channels.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
We need to adapt to these changes.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
What changes do we see?

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
One of the obvious changes is that the strength of retailers has increased significantly.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
And, oddly enough, sometimes even large manufacturers have to make concessions.

08:39.000 --> 08:50.000
In particular, it is quite curious that until 2000, such a well-known large American company as Kellogg, which produces dry breakfasts,

08:50.000 --> 09:00.000
wrote on its packaging, if it does not say Kellogg on the packaging, it means Kellogg inside.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
But since that moment, since 2000, this is no longer true,

09:06.000 --> 09:14.000
because the German Aldi network has put conditions on all manufacturers of branded products

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
to supply their products to this network exclusively under the private brand of this network.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
That is, Aldi.

09:21.000 --> 09:31.000
And the company had to make concessions, otherwise its products would simply be washed out of the shelves.

09:31.000 --> 09:45.000
The second aspect to pay attention to is that the manufacturer has now received an additional channel of direct access to the end consumer.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
The Internet.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
And here we are smoothly moving on to the sixth point, the development of an effective Internet strategy.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And here you will have to think about the following.

09:56.000 --> 10:10.000
What role will your site play in the interaction with consumers, suppliers and other interested parties?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And the second aspect.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Will you use the Internet as a means of production?

10:15.000 --> 10:25.000
And here we can look at the example of Levis Strauss, who created a new business for himself.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
This is an Internet sample of Levis Strauss.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
That is, you, as a consumer, can go to the Levis page, enter your parameters,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
and then gradually create jeans for yourself.

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
Choosing a color, choosing a style, choosing the number of rivets or a line.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Everything you like most.

10:50.000 --> 11:00.000
At the same time, the company states that only six basic classic models will be supplied to the traditional retail.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Everything else is on the Internet.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
Developing your global marketing strategy, you will need to make a number of key decisions

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
in order to clearly decide how you will work in the international markets.

11:15.000 --> 11:23.000
And the first thing you have to start with is to ask a general, fundamental question.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Will you go to the international markets or not?

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Today we assume that the answer to this question is positive.

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
And then you will need to make a number of decisions, but already in the complex.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
These mutually related decisions suggest answers to such questions.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Which markets to enter? How to enter these markets?

11:48.000 --> 11:57.000
Here you have to decide on the model of entry, whether there will be export, licensing, joint venture, or something else.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
And the sequence of entry, that is, whether you will enter the international markets in a sequence,

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
or you will dare to enter a number of markets at the same time.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
The next aspect to deal with is the marketing program.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
And here you will need to answer a number of questions.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
What will you offer foreign consumers?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
At what price? What channels of production will you use?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
What means of promotion will you choose?

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
And finally, you will need to decide how to organize international marketing activities.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
That is, decide who will be responsible for these operations.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
In case you are not yet very serious about export activities,

12:47.000 --> 12:58.000
it can be one person, or it can be a complex matrix structure.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
But before we move on to the instrumental part,

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
I would like to warn you about seven so-called international marketing traps.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
The first trap is the choice of a country or market according to the criteria of size and demand.

13:15.000 --> 13:25.000
It should be said that many companies choose such markets as the Indian market or the Chinese market.

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
Assuming that the population is large, the demand for their products will be high.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
But you need to be very careful with this,

13:35.000 --> 13:44.000
because a large number of people does not mean that this population, for example, will accept your product.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Or that it will be able to pay for your product.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Therefore, you need to be careful here.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
The next trap is underestimating existing competitors.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
Again, many companies, in particular American and European companies that enter the Chinese market,

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
somehow did not fully recognize the strength of potential competitors.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
In particular, even in such specific markets as the turbine market,

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
companies found that after some time, in addition to their high-quality products,

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
a similar Chinese product appeared at a much more attractive price,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
and consumers began to switch to this product.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Therefore, be careful with your competitors.

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
Third, it is the expectation that motivation and benefits for consumers will be similar around the world.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
Here is a curious example of Unilever, which introduced its Knorr soups to the Indian market.

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
It seems that when the product itself was tested, consumers said that the product was good.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
But nevertheless, the sales were ridiculous, the company did not achieve the desired results.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
Moreover, attempts to understand why this is happening did not immediately bear fruit.

15:11.000 --> 15:18.000
It turned out that Indian women consider this product as a surrogate.

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
And their conscience simply does not allow them to feed their beloved family with what they consider to be a fake product,

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
because they do not need time to cook it, and their soul does not invest in it.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
The next trap is the entry into the market at an unfair price.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
There are two extremes here.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
On the one hand, you can enter the market at a too low price,

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
and on the other hand, you can enter the market at a too high price.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
What is the first two options dangerous for?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
The price is too low.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
A price too low can lead to the fact that your company will be accused of dumping.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
This means anti-dumping proceedings, this means very serious fines.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
The second aspect.

16:05.000 --> 16:14.000
Here you can ask yourself a question, in fact, in different cases, whether it is important or not.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
But nevertheless, if we go to the new market,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
it is clear that the consumer does not yet know our product,

16:21.000 --> 16:28.000
and we need to inform him somehow about our product, to convince him to buy our product.

16:28.000 --> 16:36.000
If your price is too low, what will you use to advertise, promote your product?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Now let's look at the too high price.

16:40.000 --> 16:48.000
In this situation, it may happen that you will definitely be present in the market,

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
but this presence will be only conditional,

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
because the consumer may not want to pay or will not be able to pay for your product.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
In particular, Jaguar faced this problem on the Japanese market.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
Although it would seem that the Japanese market, there is even such a stereotype,

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
that there the consumer is exclusively sensitive to quality and pays less attention to prices.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
And yet, even there, Jaguar, having set too high a price,

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
was in a losing situation, a very low degree of penetration into the market.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
The next problem or trap is entering the market without planning the expansion process.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
You must immediately, today, when you are thinking about the possibility of expansion,

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
clearly plan and answer a number of very important questions.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
The next trap is working with bad distributors.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
Indeed, very often your success in the foreign market will depend on this,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
or very much on this.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Will you have a good partner, your distributor,

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
who will be able to tell you where to go around some underwater stones

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
and how to better present your product to the end consumer.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Here, the next trap is quite close,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
it is the loss of the brand's exclusivity.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
In the case of a company that has a very serious brand,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
which has an exclusive image,

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
for such companies it can be destructive to work with bad partners or distributors.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
In particular, the example of the company Lacoste,

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
which was released on the American market, became a classic, one might say.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
And they decided to use licensing as a model of entering the market.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
They found a local company that bought the right to use their Lacoste brand.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
But what did this licensee do?

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
He saw that the demand for Lacoste products was very high,

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
and in fact, he flooded the market with Lacoste shirts.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Moreover, he simply reduced the prices.

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
The company observed for several years that the exclusivity of its brand went down,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
it became available.

19:29.000 --> 19:36.000
Therefore, after a while, a decision was made to leave the American market.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
And the company only returned to this market after a while.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And now it was only export.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
It was a truly exclusive brand,

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
supported by the fact that it was sold in a limited number of boutiques.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
It was a fairly high price,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
confirming the prestige, exclusivity and quality of this brand.

19:57.000 --> 20:05.000
Now let's finally figure out how to make these decisions.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
What tools can help us here?

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
The first thing we should think about is the decision to leave the international market.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
What alternatives do we have here?

20:18.000 --> 20:25.000
It is clear that on the one hand, we can make a decision to enter the international market immediately.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
On the other hand, this decision can be postponed,

20:29.000 --> 20:36.000
or there may be a situation when you do not consider entering the international market.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
This is not an option for you, for one reason or another.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
What reasons will you choose from these alternatives?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
What will affect your decision?

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
Your decision will be influenced by the goals, resources of your company,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
motivation of your top managers.

20:59.000 --> 21:07.000
By the way, it will largely depend on the experience of international activities,

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
top managers, owners, or leading employees of the company.

21:14.000 --> 21:22.000
You will also pay attention to the competitiveness of your product.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
Do you have a product or service that can be in demand in foreign markets?

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
The opportunities of international markets will be a noticeable factor of influence for you.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
What else should we pay attention to?

21:39.000 --> 21:48.000
You should decide whether you have enough resources to enter the foreign market,

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
or you need to find help and support.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
In what aspects?

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
It can be providing information.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
Then you will look for information about professional associations,

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
whether commercial or non-commercial,

22:09.000 --> 22:17.000
that can help you in your export operations or enter the international market.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
It can be a situation when you need help from a resource group.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
Then you can try to join some companies,

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
to create a network to enter the foreign market.

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
You should decide what you do and what you can outsource.

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
It is quite often observed that companies outsourcing to some external companies

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
or organizations, ask questions like

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
conducting marketing research in foreign markets.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Of course, a specific qualification is needed for this.

23:01.000 --> 23:09.000
But sometimes companies that are just starting to master the international market,

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
they outsource almost all of their export operations.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It is also possible.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
Now, if we have made this decision,

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
we need to go through some important element,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
that is, to conduct a strategic analysis,

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
to try to plan our activities,

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
what elements will be very important here,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
what should you decide on.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
The first thing you need to decide on is the competition level.

23:47.000 --> 23:54.000
That is, what products of the market and in which country you need to be present.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
There can be different possibilities.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
I will give you an example of Heineken company,

24:03.000 --> 24:12.000
which for some time was thinking about how to understand the market in foreign markets,

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
which it was going to introduce non-alcoholic beer Buckler.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
It would seem that everything is clear.

24:19.000 --> 24:28.000
You can choose exclusively the non-alcoholic beer market as a market and a competition level.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
And then you will compete with non-alcoholic beer manufacturers.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
But there is another situation, when you can look at this market more broadly.

24:36.000 --> 24:44.000
And you can say that you are competing in the market of non-alcoholic beverages.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And then what?

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
It's just water, it's some cola, and so on.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
That is, much more broadly.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
How to understand what is more profitable for you?

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
This is your goal, and these are your resources.

25:04.000 --> 25:13.000
Speaking of competition, you also need to understand what is more important for you.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
You can create new products for existing customers.

25:18.000 --> 25:29.000
If, of course, it was about the fact that in one way or another, you already have some customers in these foreign markets.

25:29.000 --> 25:37.000
Or you start looking for new consumers for existing products.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
The next block is goals and strategy tasks.

25:42.000 --> 25:51.000
Here you need to decide on the volume, growth of sales, profitability of sales.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
You need to decide what level of capital profitability or investment you want to get.

25:59.000 --> 26:06.000
You need to decide on the intensity and sources of money flows.

26:06.000 --> 26:16.000
That is, all the goals that can be transformed into the final financial result.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
You need to understand all this.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
And always, if it is immeasurable, how to manage it?

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
Accordingly, you must give a numerical answer to each question.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
What is the level of profitability? What is the level of profitability?

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
You need to give a qualitative answer, not quantitative.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
You need to answer the question, what needs to be done to strengthen competitive advantages?

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
And in fact, it can be even more important.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
You need to understand the competitive advantages that you have.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Will they work in international markets?

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Or do you need to look for something else?

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
The next block is related to the distribution of resources.

27:05.000 --> 27:12.000
We say that all companies have limited resources.

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
And your decision is how to distribute them between countries or product markets.

27:20.000 --> 27:29.000
Very often, at the first stages, we see that a lion's share of resources is still allocated to the domestic market.

27:29.000 --> 27:37.000
And only the minimum resources are allocated to conquer international markets.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
The goal of your strategy.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Here you return to this question.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
Maybe at the first stages it will be the right decision for you.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
And the second question is how best to divide the available resources between functional units.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
To more successfully implement the strategy.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
Companies usually add international units to their functional structure.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
And then there are problems inside the company.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
How to distribute resources between functional units that are oriented to the domestic market.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
And those units that are oriented to the external market.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
The next block of questions is related to the sources of competitive advantage.

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
And here you need to understand what are the sources for your company.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
What do you have?

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Maybe it's access to cheaper resources.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Or vice versa.

28:39.000 --> 28:48.000
You have a highly qualified workforce.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
And this is closely related to the next question.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
How long will you be able to maintain this advantage?

28:56.000 --> 29:08.000
If you have access to something cheap, you will not be able to maintain this advantage for long.

29:08.000 --> 29:16.000
And if you have access to something cheap, you will not be able to maintain this advantage for long.

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
And as we said, you need to understand what you need to do to strengthen these competitive advantages.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Or maybe it's really about buying something new.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
And finally, the sources of the synergetic effect.

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
Can you provide a combined use of resources to promote your products to different markets?

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
And by the way, is there an opportunity to use competitive advantages?

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
Especially if you have such a competitive advantage as a strong brand.

29:50.000 --> 30:00.000
Accordingly, a strong brand, if you can use it on many country markets, will give you real economy.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
And it will become more understandable for international consumers.

30:04.000 --> 30:10.000
And, accordingly, it can raise the image of your company in the eyes of foreign consumers.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Now our next question, our next solution.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Which international markets should companies enter?

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
We have two alternative approaches to choosing international markets.

30:24.000 --> 30:32.000
The first approach assumes that you perceive the global market as a country or a group of countries.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
The second approach assumes that you consider the same global market.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
But now from the perspective of a group of consumers with similar characteristics.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
What are the differences between these approaches? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

30:46.000 --> 30:54.000
The first approach is certainly good because you have the opportunity to use secondary information.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
Accordingly, information that is more accessible and cheaper.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
You know very well that statistics are collected in countries.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
This fundamentally distinguishes this approach from the second approach.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
Where you may have a problem with getting this information.

31:17.000 --> 31:25.000
Since in these conditions it will be that you will probably need primary research.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Which will naturally make this event more expensive.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
And the second aspect is that there is a real problem with collecting reliable cross-national statistics.

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
Accordingly, the first case is easier in terms of obtaining information.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
The second is perhaps much more objective.

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
Since you can collect adequate information about the group of consumers that you are interested in.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
The second aspect is where these options diverge.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
Traditionally, we talk about the fact that the sale and promotion of products is organized by country.

32:05.000 --> 32:13.000
But in the second case, we have a problem with how to organize the sale and promotion.

32:13.000 --> 32:23.000
If it can happen that consumers of this global segment are located very far from each other.

32:24.000 --> 32:32.000
Accordingly, the first method tells us that, alas, we will not always have an adequate marketing picture.

32:32.000 --> 32:40.000
Since consumers in one country may be more different.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
Than consumers who are located in different countries.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
And should differ more from each other.

32:46.000 --> 32:56.000
But nevertheless, in this case, they or they can organize this group with similar characteristics.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The choice is yours.

32:58.000 --> 33:07.000
Now let's see what tool can be used to select foreign markets.

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
And I suggest you use a tool that actually works like a set of seeds.

33:14.000 --> 33:22.000
You can imagine it very clearly if we talk about a set of seeds.

33:22.000 --> 33:30.000
And what is important is that each seed has a smaller diameter of this cell.

33:30.000 --> 33:41.000
And, accordingly, it allows you to get more and more information at each level.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
In this case, when we talk about selecting target markets,

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
you can get the most targeted markets, removing those that do not suit you.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Now how is this done?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Step by step.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
The first step is the most obvious.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
You start by exploring the macro level.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
At this step, you analyze the overall potential of the country's market.

34:07.000 --> 34:15.000
And here you get help from resources such as various statistical collections,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
where you can get economic information.

34:18.000 --> 34:26.000
For example, as a criterion for the cutoff, you can use GDP per capita.

34:26.000 --> 34:33.000
Or some other criterion that is important for your company.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
You can also use criteria such as the political environment.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
And here, in order to get some quantitative assessment,

34:42.000 --> 34:51.000
you can use indexes that are formed by various independent organizations

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
that assess the political environment, political risks, work in different countries.

34:56.000 --> 35:03.000
And you can use this index at a certain level, not lower.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
In this case, if the risk is higher than the level that is acceptable for you,

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
then this country is rejected.

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
In the same way, you can use factors such as social structure or geographical factors.

35:19.000 --> 35:28.000
Here we are talking about setting a criterion that will allow you to adjust.

35:28.000 --> 35:34.000
Some country gives you opportunities, and you consider it further.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Some country is not suitable for you, and you reject it.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
At the next step, we already remember the market of our product.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Before that, we talked exclusively about the country's market.

35:48.000 --> 35:59.000
Now, our best friends are indicators, for example, of the size and growth of your product market.

35:59.000 --> 36:06.000
Or if we are talking about a fundamentally new product that is not yet present in this market,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
or is not present at all in the global market,

36:09.000 --> 36:16.000
then we look at the trends or the size and growth of the market of similar products.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
How recognized are they in the world?

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
And we rely on this knowledge.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
In this case, if it is a clear product and its market exists in the world,

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
then you rely on factors such as the stage of development of this market.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Why is it important to us?

36:35.000 --> 36:48.000
Because if you see a situation where the market of a product in your country and on the international market is at different stages,

36:48.000 --> 36:54.000
then it may require your company to adapt to your marketing complex.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And these are additional costs.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
If you are not ready to go to these additional costs,

37:01.000 --> 37:08.000
if we find these same discrepancies in the stages of development, in the stages of the life cycle,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
we reject the country.

37:10.000 --> 37:18.000
In the case if you are satisfied with such costs, great, but then this criterion is not interesting to us,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
we just do not expose it.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Taxes and fees.

37:22.000 --> 37:30.000
Of course, this will be directly related to the model of the input you will apply on this market.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
It is clear that if we are talking about high tariff protection of the market,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
despite the fact that you are going to export it,

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
this may be the first signal that you reject this country.

37:41.000 --> 37:48.000
Or if we are already talking about the fact that you want to organize local production in the country,

37:48.000 --> 37:58.000
then the issue of taxes and fees from residents may become more critical for you.

37:58.000 --> 38:06.000
And, accordingly, the level of this very tax protection or tax time that exists in this country

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
can also become a detracting criterion for you.

38:09.000 --> 38:17.000
Another very important aspect is the various difficulties in entering the market features.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
Let's say your company is engaged in direct sales.

38:23.000 --> 38:30.000
Look at how such companies as Avon or Mary Kay Cosmetics operate,

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
which use this very sales staff promoting their products.

38:35.000 --> 38:41.000
If you go to the country market, where there is simply no physical,

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
there is no extensive workforce that can be attracted as a sales staff,

38:48.000 --> 38:54.000
this will become a barrier for you, and this is a difficult feature of the market.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
And this market goes beyond consideration.

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
At this stage, you should try to combine some quantitative indicators.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
For example, the market size should not be less than a certain level,

39:10.000 --> 39:17.000
or the market growth should not be less than 5% per year.

39:17.000 --> 39:24.000
It may also be that you indicate a certain barrier,

39:24.000 --> 39:30.000
and if this barrier exists, the country is rejected.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
If there is no barrier, it is considered further.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
The next element of our analysis is the micro-level research.

39:39.000 --> 39:47.000
At this level, you start to consider the factors that affect the profitability of the country's operations.

39:47.000 --> 39:55.000
Only at this stage do the analysis and assessment of existing and potential competitors appear.

39:55.000 --> 40:03.000
It is not a secret that this is very expensive information, and it is very difficult to collect.

40:03.000 --> 40:10.000
If you have a huge number of countries and a huge number of competitors, it is a huge expense.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
At this stage, you start to analyze competitors,

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
you analyze the costs of entering the market.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
It should be said that very often, if we talk about B2C markets,

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
that is, the markets that serve the end consumer,

40:29.000 --> 40:36.000
barriers to entry are, for example, costs for the sale of products,

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
costs for the promotion of products.

40:39.000 --> 40:46.000
Moreover, I will give you an example of the American non-alcoholic beverage market.

40:46.000 --> 40:54.000
It is believed that the exporter is forced to spend about 30% of his export revenue on the promotion of products.

40:54.000 --> 41:02.000
Otherwise, the share of your brand's voice will be so weak in this general cloud, in general noise,

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
that no one will know about it, and who will buy it then.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
Accordingly, what else are we paying attention to?

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
Here we analyze sales, here we analyze the potential growth of profits.

41:18.000 --> 41:29.000
All this, this complex analysis, allows us to say that we can range segments on profitability.

41:29.000 --> 41:37.000
That is, the country that you have chosen, the market that you have chosen, you are already splitting into segments.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Sometimes this stage is called micro-segmentation.

41:40.000 --> 41:47.000
Here you look at specific segments of the non-alcoholic beverage market.

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
Depending on how you are used to segmenting this market,

41:54.000 --> 42:04.000
you can select segments with preferences for prices, preferences for taste, and so on.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
And already inside, look, arrange these segments on profitability.

42:08.000 --> 42:15.000
And this will allow you to choose those segments that you think are the most attractive.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
And then proceed to the process of strategic planning.

42:20.000 --> 42:35.000
What is the model of the entry?

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
Our next decision is related to how we will enter the market.

42:41.000 --> 42:49.000
And by choosing the model of the entry, we can rely on three conditional rules for choosing the model of the entry.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
The first of them is called the naive rule.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Why naive?

42:54.000 --> 43:04.000
Because the company follows the rule of choosing, or rather using, a single model of entry for all foreign markets.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
What is the problem here?

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
Yes, of course, you may have an already developed strategy, a developed model,

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
but nevertheless, you ignore the uniqueness of international markets.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
If you are used to export, you use the export model,

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
you must understand that each market is protected in different ways.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
We are talking about tariff and non-tariff barriers.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
And here the situation may arise that you use export,

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
if there is some serious protection of this market.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
This will be a clearly erroneous decision.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
The second rule is pragmatic.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
In this situation, you use exclusively profitable models of entry.

43:53.000 --> 44:01.000
But at the same time, you remember that as soon as the model ceases to be profitable, you switch to another one.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
What is the problem here?

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
The fact is that, as practice shows, profitable models are not always the best.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
We saw this quite recently when I gave you an example with Lacoste.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
Yes, of course, licensing in their case was absolutely profitable.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
But the other thing is that the brand began to suffer.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
And this is the asset, the most important asset of the company,

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
which cannot be lost or which is desirable not to be injured.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
And therefore, I repeat, profitable models are not always the best.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
And there is a third rule for this, a strategic rule.

44:41.000 --> 44:49.000
It says that you must systematically evaluate and compare alternative models of entry,

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
and use a whole list of criteria.

44:53.000 --> 44:59.000
These are the company's resources, these are the risks, these are non-commercial goals.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
But, of course, this requires serious analytical efforts from you,

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
the need for strategic planning.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
What are the alternative options when choosing entry models for foreign markets?

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
Usually, there are three types of these strategies.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
The first type of strategy is export strategies.

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
Almost all companies that start on foreign markets resort to them.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
This is perhaps the most common entry model.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
What is good about export?

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
Export is good because it allows you to diversify the sales.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
It is not a secret that different markets can be at different stages of development.

45:44.000 --> 45:52.000
And when you use export, you can see that some markets are going down,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
and some are going up.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
And thus, in general, your export strategy will be balanced.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
What are the features or models that are included here?

46:05.000 --> 46:11.000
Export is usually divided into two types, indirect and direct export.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
Indirect export assumes that you produce your product on the domestic market,

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
and then sell it to the intermediary that is located on your market.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
And the ownership rights go here.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
And then you practically do not control the marketing system.

46:29.000 --> 46:37.000
The intermediary and the customer are responsible for your product.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
With direct export, your intermediary is located on the receiving markets.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
And in this case, the company has more control and, accordingly,

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
more opportunity to influence the marketing system.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
If we look at the contract models,

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
there are usually five types of strategies.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
These are licensing, franchising, contract management,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
key contracts, and contract production.

47:07.000 --> 47:14.000
I would like to draw your attention to the first two types,

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
because here marketing plays a significant role,

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
while in the last three,

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
the share of companies that go to foreign markets

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
is almost not marketed.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Let's look at licensing.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
What does licensing imply?

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
Licensing implies transferring rights to the use of a patent

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
that protects the technological process

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
and or the trademark of another company

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
for a certain period and for a certain fee.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
Accordingly, this certain fee can be a fixed,

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
so-called pauschal payment,

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
and it can be a variable, this is royalty.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
This variable payment is usually calculated as a percentage

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
of the sales volume, or, let's say,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
it can be a percentage of the profit,

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
it can be a percentage of the price of the licensed product.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
And why is licensing good for companies?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Why is it used?

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
On the one hand, licensing allows you to avoid problems

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
that may arise from the point of view of market protection,

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
because the market is tariff-based,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
and, accordingly, the export is not very suitable.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
On the other hand, licensing is sometimes better

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
than, for example, the organization of production on this market,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
because this market is not large enough,

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
not attractive enough for the company.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
It understands that the costs will be much higher

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
than the profit you will get as a result

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
of using the enterprise in full ownership on this market.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
Therefore, licensing is a kind of intermediate option.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
Franchising is another model

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
that allows you to transfer something,

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
but in this case it is assumed that you transfer,

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
in addition to the right to use the patent,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
the right to use the trademark,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
you also transfer approaches to business.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
And here we have classic examples of the use of franchising.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
There are such companies as McDonald's,

49:47.000 --> 49:53.000
and many fast food chains operate in exactly this logic.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
There are also companies like Zara

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
and other companies operating in the retail sphere

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
that also quite often resort to this model.

50:06.000 --> 50:13.000
And finally, investment models also have several invested opportunities.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
Opportunity number one is joint ventures.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
Joint ventures are certainly very good

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
because you get a local partner

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
who has the knowledge, skills, skills

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
to interact with this business environment.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
They can tell you what is most in demand.

50:37.000 --> 50:43.000
And don't forget that there is a risk diversification.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
Therefore, it is often said that joint ventures

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
are almost a panacea against political risks.

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
This is a strategy to reduce political risks.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Strategic alliances.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
What are their differences from joint ventures?

51:03.000 --> 51:10.000
It is not always the case that new organizational units arise.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
It may be informal companies,

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
but nevertheless, companies are united by certain common goals.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
These alliances can be based on the possibility

51:23.000 --> 51:28.000
of providing each other access to local markets

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
of companies participating in the alliance.

51:31.000 --> 51:37.000
It may be that these alliances are based on joint production.

51:37.000 --> 51:46.000
It may be that these alliances are mostly built on technology transfer.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
The problem of strategic alliances is that

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
over time, the goals and tasks of the companies

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
participating in the alliance may change

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
and gradually begin to diverge.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
This often leads to the fact that

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
the alliances cease to exist.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
The next model is a full-time enterprise.

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
This is the most costly and problematic model

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
of entering the market from the point of view of risks.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
This is because you make significant investments

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
in the international market.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
You must carry out real analytical work

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
that will allow you to make this decision.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
There are two other investment models.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
This is a full-time enterprise.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
In fact, there are more than two models.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
Because absorption is one of the options.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
But in the first case,

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
let's say you create an enterprise from scratch.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
In this situation, you can initially adjust the format

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
for your business.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
In particular, we see that this is how

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
such giants of retail trading as Metro or Ikea

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
entered the Russian market.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Another option is absorption.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
When you buy an existing company

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
and you actually draw its existing sales channels,

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
its goods, and its brands into your business.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Thus, both the first and the second options

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
are the most costly and the most risky for us.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
Let's see how the company can make a choice

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
from these possible alternative options.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
I suggest you take a piece of paper

53:58.000 --> 54:03.000
and draw some important squares for us.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
The first square will indicate profitability.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
In this scheme, you see that profitability

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
is indicated by the ROE indicator.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
But you can use not this accounting indicator,

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
but the income indicator.

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
The second square is the international risk factors.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
Under this square, I ask you to write

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
the most significant factors that will affect your business.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
There are three more very significant squares.

54:47.000 --> 54:52.000
These are assets, costs, and sales.

54:52.000 --> 55:01.000
These five squares are the most important for us.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
There is another one, of course.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
It is the head office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
which dictates the goals.

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
Or, if we are talking about a company

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
that has not yet reached the multinational level,

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
we should indicate the goals that the company pursues

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
in the international markets.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Why did I ask you to do this?

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Because these are the key elements of the analysis.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
The company conducts analysis number one.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
It is the analysis of sensitivity.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
When you consider the international risk factors

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
that you have written down and their influence on profitability.

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
The time horizon is 3-5 years.

55:57.000 --> 56:04.000
And most often, you are actually creating a scenario.

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
For example, if the income of the population is reduced by 3%,

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
how will this affect our profitability?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And so on.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
When we talk about assets, you should clearly understand

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
which type of asset is the most important for you.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
Is it the turnover or the main capital?

56:27.000 --> 56:36.000
Naturally, we see that as we move from export to local production,

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
the importance of the main capital will increase for us.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
Because we need more turnover,

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
if we are talking about a trade representative, for example.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
The next element of the analysis is the costs.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
And here you should look at the costs,

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
let's say, for local materials, local labor, and so on.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
You should compare them with the costs

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
that are associated with production on your domestic market.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
And here, as you can see in this diagram,

57:17.000 --> 57:25.000
we have constant costs as we move from export models to local production.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
And the variable costs are the opposite.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
And finally, the sales.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
Another important element of our analysis.

57:35.000 --> 57:42.000
You should assess the volume of sales you want to achieve on this market.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
Of course, the market share will affect this,

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
which, in turn, depends on the market potential.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
But we all remember that you can influence the market share

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
through your marketing actions.

57:56.000 --> 58:01.000
In this case, the scheme is defined through marketing expenses.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
So, what do we see?

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
All these models can be arranged

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
by the degree of control of the necessary assets,

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
variable and constant costs, market share and risk.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
By combining all the elements of the analysis,

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
you can choose the best model for you.

58:26.000 --> 58:35.000
What is the role of the international marketing strategy?

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000
Now we are going to move to the next level of the international marketing strategy.

58:48.000 --> 58:53.000
It is defined by the international positioning strategy.

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
The practice shows that there are three most important opportunities

59:01.000 --> 59:07.000
for positioning goods and services in global marketing.

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
The first is positioning in accordance with the global consumer culture.

59:12.000 --> 59:21.000
In this situation, you show your brand as an attribute of this global consumer culture.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
What are the goods that are used for?

59:25.000 --> 59:31.000
These are mainly companies that produce high-tech products

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
or companies that produce high-touch products,

59:36.000 --> 59:43.000
that is, products that require a high degree of emotional involvement of the consumer.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
In the first case, high-tech,

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
we show that we speak the same language with the consumer.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.000
This specific language of technical terms

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.000
or something that can be understood by the mass consumer of high-tech products.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Here, companies often use two main attributes

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
or two main characteristics that they play with

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and show that this is a brand for this target audience

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
that speaks the same language.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
This is experience and this is professionalism.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I can give you an example, but not high-tech,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
a mixed area.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
This is the Banking sector.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Chase Manhattan Bank.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
One of their slogans was

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
the following

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Profit from experience.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Thus, they positioned their bank

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000
as a bank that has a very significant experience of interacting with consumers

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
and can provide them with maximum protection

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
or the most favorable conditions.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
If we talk about high-touch products,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.000
here we can see how such positioning is used by L'Oreal.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Remember their famous slogan,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I am worthy of it.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Thus, we are called to touch the global consumer culture,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
the main criterion of which is beauty,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
which will save the world.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Our next positioning strategy is

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
positioning in accordance with the foreign consumer culture.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
What is happening here?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You try to tie your brand to a certain country,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
to the culture of this country,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
and thus play at the best,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
the most valuable thing in this country.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
There are many examples here.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It is very interesting to look at how vodka is positioned.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
In particular, in the American market,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
you can clearly see that some brands use this strategy.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
In particular, if we look at how the capital is positioned,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and what they use,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
they use the symbolism of Russia of the 1920s.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A reference to Mayakovsky, to the KGB,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
and their advertising campaign is based on this.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
On the other hand, there is Polish vodka Belvedere,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
which refers us to the foreign, that is, Polish culture

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
with the slogan that 500 years ago,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
when people tried to turn lead into gold,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
the Poles invented a way to turn rye into vodka.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Thus, all this clearly refers us to the foreign consumer culture

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and tries to instill in a foreign consumer

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
a desire to buy these goods

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
and, accordingly, to make them fall in love with the country

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and the product it produces.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
At the same time, the most important thing to remember

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
is that this strategy has clear limitations.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
The fact is that it is largely based on stereotypes.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000
If there is a clear connection between Russia and vodka,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
or vodka and Russia, it doesn't matter,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
then this positive connection,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
this positioning will be successful.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
If there are no such connections,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
the consumer will not understand what you are talking about.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
In particular, this is well understood by the research results

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
carried out by New Zealand companies.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
They conducted research in Japan

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
on what the Japanese associate New Zealand with.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It turned out that the strongest association is sheep.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
While, say, industrial products are not known at all,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
are not perceived at all, and have negative associations.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Finally, positioning in accordance with the local consumer culture.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
This is, if you want, a development of the previous positioning strategy,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
but at a lower level.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
When you show that your brand is used in a certain area,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
or it is produced in this area.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Look how recently the Levenbrau brand

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
is actively linking its brand to Oktoberfest.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
We can also trace a number of beer brands

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
that work this way.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
What are the goods that are good for?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Basically, as practice shows,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
it is mostly good for food products,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
which carry a very obvious color

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and a link to a certain area.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Whether it is Swiss cheese,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
and to a specific area,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
or French champagne.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
What are we talking about? Champagne.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
This is the same option.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Now we need to figure out

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
what product strategies we use and how.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000
If we look at the innovative strategies used by companies,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
we should pay attention to the fact that there are two blocks.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
This is the follower strategy,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and this is the market leader strategy.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Let's deal with the follower.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
The follower can use the imitation strategy.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
We are not saying that this is something new.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
In this case, you are imitating an existing product.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
You are not adding anything to it,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
you are not improving it.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
In this case, the company pursues the goal

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
of making a profit in the short term.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Moreover, such companies often

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
try to supply their products,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
for example, to retail chains,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
to their brands.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Another type of the follower strategy

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
is modification.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
When you change a product in several ways,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
but it does not affect the essential features

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and characteristics of the product.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
It can be a shape that is better,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000
more successful than the main product.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It can be a color or something else.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
It can be some minor attributes.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The goal is to make a profit in the short term.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
On the other hand, you are more active

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
in declaring yourself and marking your presence on the market.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
But again, when we talk about a brand,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
you often do not develop your own brand.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
You are leaving the OEM and private brands.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Finally, there are two types of the leader strategy.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The first one is when you use an improvement strategy.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
You offer improved products to the market

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
that are fundamentally different from existing products.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
They add value.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
You are already saying that your goal

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
is to make a profit in the medium term.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
At the same time, you are developing the market.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
When you offer several modifications

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
for different segments of the market.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Someone needs washing machines

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
that allow you to save electricity.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Someone needs water resources.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000
In this situation, the company develops its own brand

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
rather than hiding behind private brands or OEMs.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Finally, there are innovative products and strategies.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
You are already saying that you are creating

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
something fundamentally new for the market.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Just like Sony invented Walkman.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
In this situation, we are talking about your own brand

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and your goal to make a profit in the long term.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Now we should pay attention to one of the important components

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
of the product strategy,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
which is often highlighted in a separate section.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It is branding.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Of course, it is science and art.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
We will look at the main elements of the brand strategy

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
that you should follow

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
when you are developing a brand

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and launching it on the foreign market.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
The first thing to start with

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
is developing a long-term strategy for the brand.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
For example, will it describe the product category

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
or will it be a more descriptive name?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:17.000
For example, a sports master will describe the brand

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:26.000
or a brand virgin will describe the product category.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
The second thing is to decide how your new brand

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
will fit into the entire architecture of your brand

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
and into the hierarchy of brands.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Will it be a mother's brand or a sub-brand?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
How will it relate to all your brands?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Next, you should make a serious analysis of the costs

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
for the development, legal verification, registration of your name,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and its protection.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
You will have a list of costs and the actual costs

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
that you will incur.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
The next thing is to consider as many options as possible

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
for the names of the brands.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You should not limit yourself to one brand

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
that you like very much.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It may turn out that at the legal verification stage

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
this name belongs to another company.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Or there may be some other problems at the next steps.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So, consider as many options as possible.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000
You can even consider the creation of the Pentium brand.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
The creators of the Pentium brand considered about 1500

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
different names.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
It is a very serious job.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Start with a large number.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Next, you should set very clear criteria for choosing a brand.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000
The most common criteria are the brand's name,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
the associations you want to put in it.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It is a determining factor.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But since we are talking about the fact that our brand should work

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
in a foreign language environment,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000
another important criterion is the ability to pronounce this name

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
in different languages.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So, there should be no problems with pronunciation,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.000
no negative associations when pronouncing this name.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
For this, we need the following step.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Consultation with native speakers of different languages.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:15.000
This will also allow you to exclude the words

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
with negative double meanings.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Again, there are some unpleasant aspects.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
In particular, General Motors faced this problem

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
when they introduced their Chevrolet Nova brand

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
in Spanish-speaking countries.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
But it turned out that Latin Americans,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Spanish-speaking people,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
pronounce the word Nova in a different way.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It means that it does not work, it will not work.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It is a bad advertisement for a car.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Next, you should look at how the name you chose

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
fits into the general business strategy of the company.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
All employees of your company should know and understand this.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Finally, you should allocate enough resources

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
to convey the chosen name to the target audience.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Of course, various communication tools will help you here.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Now, what are the alternatives in the field of international branding?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:46.000
We can divide these alternatives into four main options.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
The first option is a single brand for all foreign markets.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Look at how Coca-Cola holds the brand Coke.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It sounds like Coke in absolutely all countries.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
What do we get in this case?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
We get the effectiveness of marketing.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Because you have a single brand everywhere,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
you do not need additional costs.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And, of course, this is just for international consumers.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Because in every country you can see your favorite Coke

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and you will not have any problems with trying to find out

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
whether this is the drink you are looking for or some other.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
The next option is when you use a corporate brand

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
as part of the umbrella approach.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
When you open a corporate brand as an umbrella

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
over all the products your company produces.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Look at how 3M, Sony and many other companies work.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
The same thing.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
The maximum effectiveness of marketing is very simple for international consumers.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But both in the first and second case,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
you make a significant assumption that the markets are homogeneous.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And, first of all, despite the fact that your brand will move from one market

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and from one language environment to another,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000
you believe that there will be no problems with the perception and pronunciation of this brand.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Moreover, if we say that we show our product to you in one person,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
one brand is used,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
then you must meet the very high standards of quality everywhere.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And in the case if a consumer under the same brand,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
but in different countries, finds different products of high quality,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
it can seriously affect the image and reputation of your company.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And, accordingly, these two approaches are gradually moving towards

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
turning these brands, single brands, into global brands.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
In order to get another very good advantage.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
This is an additional power over retailers.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Because in fact, not a single self-respecting retailer will allow

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:26.000
the assortment of products of this global brand not to be present.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Now let's move on.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
What other alternatives do we have?

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
This is an alternative, a single brand adapted to the local market.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It is designed to solve the problems of avoiding the market's agomogenity,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
and solve the problems of the difficulty of pronunciation,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
negative associations,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
that is, everything that can worsen the image of the brand.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
What example can be used here?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
For example, Sasyete Big,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
probably a well-known French company,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
which produces disposable blades, pens, and so on.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
In particular, the founder of the company, Marcel Biche,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
was forced to abandon the last letter of his last name,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
the letter H,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000
because when moving this brand to the English-speaking language environment,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
there were clear negative associations.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:35.000
If we look at the problems that arise here with this solution,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:43.000
it is certainly a higher level of costs compared to our first two cases.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Now, the case of the highest costs,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
when you call the same product in different markets in different ways,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
that is, your brand for each local market.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
What else is problematic here?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Of course, this is difficult for international consumers.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:12.000
If you travel and discover in some country that your favorite brand is called in a completely different way,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
you sometimes start to have additional questions.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Is it a brand at all?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Maybe it's some company that mimics,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
tries to imagine that this is my favorite brand.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Therefore, there are problems here.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
But this certainly gives a very serious advantage.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Yes, you have no problems with pronunciation and so on.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
You have the opportunity to actually get closer to the local consumer.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
He will consider you his.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And the third is the ability to vary the quality of the product from country to country.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Let's take one example, the most obvious.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
This is one of the brands of Unilever,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
the Snuggle brand,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:11.000
which is based on a product like a tissue softening compound.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000
But when you move from market to market,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
it turns out that even in Australia this brand sounds like Hagi.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
In Spain it's Mimosin.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
In Italy it's Coccolino.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And so on and so forth.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
But if we still translate all these names into Russian,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000
it turns out that the softness is still based on different languages.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Yes, it's close to the consumer, but the costs are very high.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And in fact, this is the option that companies are already starting to move away from.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It's very costly.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Let's move on.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And let's see how international pricing strategies are determined.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And the first problem that companies face

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
is that when you start exporting your products to foreign markets,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
it suddenly turns out that the consumer on your domestic market

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
and the consumer on some international markets

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
pay two different prices.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And it is clear that the foreign consumer pays more.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And often much more.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And what can this lead to?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:43.000
To the fact that he simply will not want to buy your product at such a high price.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
What makes such a serious increase in price?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
You can see that starting from the domestic market,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
you have two additional blocks of costs.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
The first block of costs is related to the export cost

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
before the importer enters the country.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And here we can include the costs of operating the export service,

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
insurance costs, consular fees at the airport or at the sea, and so on.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
The second factor or the second group of factors

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
is the import cost when the product arrives in the country of the importer.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And here we include customs duties,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and the costs of warranty storage,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
that is, the customs warehouse,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and the cost of storage in the trading warehouse,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and all our marketing and household costs,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
and the formation, let's say, of commercial loan financing.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
As a result, what do we see?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
The export price is much higher than the price of our domestic market.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I suggest you stop the presentation now

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:04.000
and formulate the possibilities of reducing the effect of the export price escalation.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Let's try to answer this question together.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:26.000
There are five ways to reduce the effect of the export price escalation.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000
The first, quite understandable way is to reduce the length of the supply channel.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
That is, you try to either remove some intermediaries

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
or switch to direct supply.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
If we remove these additional intermediaries,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
we, among other things, also minimize the effect of the import price escalation.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
The second option is when we start to reduce the costs

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.000
due to the fact that we are taking away some very expensive characteristics or features of the product.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:06.000
That is, you try to simplify the quality of the product a little

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
or offer this market, let's say, some simplified models.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.000
The next option is to deliver components and assemble products on the foreign market.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
That is, you reduce the amount of customs duties

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:30.000
due to the fact that the final product is much more expensive than the components.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:38.000
The fourth option is to modify the product in order to transfer it to another customs classification.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And finally, the reduction of the price of the manufacturer.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
How?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
This is done by means of marginal price education.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
In order for us to understand what marginal price education is in this case,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
let's first turn to the table of alternatives to export price education.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Here you see that we have several options for setting prices on foreign markets.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000
In fact, when it comes to export price education, there are three basic approaches.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.000
The first approach is that you use a single standard price for all absolute markets,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
both internal and export.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
This is column number two.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Another option is when you use the so-called double price education.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
You have two prices.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
The first is the price of the internal market, and the second is the price of the export markets.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And finally, the third option is the differentiated price education.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:50.000
In this case, you develop your own strategy, and you have a price for each of your export markets.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:58.000
If we look at the first two approaches, they are based on the analysis of costs.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And here we turn to the table.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
There are two options.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
The first option is when we follow the plus-cost method.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
That is, you transfer all absolutely real costs to the product.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And what we see in the third column at the exit is that you get a fairly high price

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
for the end international and foreign consumer.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:36.000
A slightly different approach involves using marginal price education.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And here we are talking about zeroing out your permanent costs.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000
You zero out your, say, production overhead costs.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And all this allows you to reduce the price.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
The other thing is that you understand that in this situation,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000
your internal market will have to pay for your expansion to the international market.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Accordingly, the third option, which we have discussed, is differentiated price education.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And how can you offer or implement price indexing here?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:26.000
It is already being done on the basis of demand and supply.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I want to show you an approach that allows you to carry out this very indexing.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Please pay attention to the table.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000
In the second column, we have a demand indicator.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000
In this case, we take the annual volume of goods purchased per person.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:57.000
And you look at the statistics of countries, how much do consumers spend in these countries.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
The third column shows the resulting demand coefficient.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000
As it is calculated, you take your internal market per unit.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And, accordingly, the difference in the volume of demand will give you the resulting coefficient.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The next column shows the cost of the product.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
In this case, we take $ 1,000.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
This is, of course, a conditional price.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.000
You can set your price with the demand coefficient, which we have presented in the previous column.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:44.000
The next column shows us the offer after the price of the product with the demand coefficient.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Here you take into account the number of competitors, which allows you to adjust the conditions of the external and internal markets.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:09.000
In fact, in addition to the number of competitors, you can also use other indicators, such as the standard of living in a country or something else.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Let's go back to this example.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:22.000
If we look at our internal market, in this case the US market, we have two competitors.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And when we look at some other markets, we reduce the price if there are more competitors.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:46.000
And if we took, for example, the standard of living in a country, then, accordingly, if the standard of living in the country N was higher than in our country, then we should have increased the price.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Usually, the percentage of adjustment indicated in brackets is taken in the range of plus or minus 15%.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:05.000
But the rule remains the same. The more competitors, the lower the price. The higher the standard of living, the higher the price.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And finally, in the penultimate column, we see the resulting comparative price.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And the last column indicates which strategic category another country can fall into.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Either it is at the level of the internal market, or higher, or lower, or much lower.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Now let's pay attention to how companies set prices on international markets.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.000
That is, global pricing. There are two approaches.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Again, the use of a standard price, a single price.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And the second is the use of a price for each market.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000
What factors affect our decision here?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:07.000
But before answering the question of what factors affect, let's answer the question of what goals we set in one case or another.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:21.000
If we are talking about price standardization, then our main goal is to use a single positioning of the goods of the company in all markets.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And, accordingly, the standard price is the support of the positioning strategy that we need.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
This does not confuse the consumer.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:39.000
On the other hand, if we are talking about price differentiation, then our goal is to get the maximum profit.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We understand that markets are different, and we set our price on each market in order to get the maximum from this market.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.000
And the general rule is that it is better to use differentiated prices.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Let's look at the factors.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
So, the factors that contribute to price differentiation.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
The first is consumer preferences.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And here we will think in terms of price sensitivity.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And if you see that in different countries consumers react differently to prices, then it makes sense to set these different prices.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Where consumers are more price sensitive, the price is lower.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Where consumers are more quality-oriented, the price is higher.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
But sometimes companies forget about this.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
In particular, this happened with the brand Johnny Walker in Japan.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:04.000
The Japanese market, as we said, is a market that is traditionally considered a market where you can set high prices, because the consumer is oriented to quality.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And indeed, Johnny Walker was a brand that cost a lot of money, and nevertheless, consumers were happy to buy it.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:23.000
But the company received information that their main competitor, at that time, was going to enter the market, that is, Shibarigal.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And in order to protect themselves, the company decided to lower the prices, to attract more consumers.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
As a result, consumers perceived this as a signal to reduce quality.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And instead of creating barriers to the entry of the competitor, the company actually invited the competitor to the market and lost a share of the market.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
The second aspect is the competitive situation.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Here we are talking about the fact that in different markets you will have different opportunities to influence prices.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Depending on whether it is monopoly on the one hand, and on the other hand, absolute competition.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Accordingly, in the first case, you have the opportunity to set your prices, and in the second case, you do not have such an opportunity.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And finally, the costs are also a factor that will push you towards the use of price differentiation.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Since the different cost of materials, different costs for labor, different tax costs, and so on.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:49.000
All this will mean that in order to cover your costs, let's say, in those markets where they are significant, you will have to set a significant price.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Against the situation when the costs can be lower, and, accordingly, the price can be lower.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
This is regarding the market factors.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
There is also a block of factors that contribute to price differentiation.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
These are external factors.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Here we pay attention to such aspects as inflation and exchange rates.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:25.000
For example, we saw in 1998 that very seriously, sharp changes in the exchange rate can shake the company's competitive positions.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And therefore, companies begin to have to change their prices.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:44.000
For example, if we talk about inflation, God forbid, hyperinflation, companies often have to reconsider their prices, constantly increasing their level.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:51.000
In particular, the 1980s were characterized by high rates of inflation in many countries.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:04.000
In particular, in the 1980s, the company Procter & Gamble had to increase its production prices by 30% every two weeks.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And in the end, the company understood that it was losing its customers, but it had nothing left.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.000
If we look at one more criterion, it is regulation, tariffs, and fees.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000
In the case when a company faces high tariff protection, this is what we were talking about.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
This is the additional effect of escalation.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
You will have to increase the price.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
What contributes to price standardization?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:47.000
The first is, contrary to what we just said, high tariffs, on the contrary, a reduction in trade barriers.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
And this is what allows you to level the prices in the markets.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.000
A reduction in transport costs also allows you to level the prices in different markets.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Another important factor is global supply.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
How can this affect you?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Let's see.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000
If you are a supplier of a global network, for example, Ashan,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Ashan will require maximum discounts from you.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Moreover, we know that Ashan is present in a huge number of markets.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000
If you sell them products at the same price in Russia, which suits them,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:43.000
and, say, in the UK or France, you offer them the same product at a higher price,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.000
the company will not understand you and will require a single price from you, which satisfies it,

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
on all absolute markets.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Therefore, the pressure of these active retailers is clearly contributing to price harmonization,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
that is, to the price standard.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Improving communication and information flows.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Look, previously, it was unlikely for a consumer to make long trips from country to country

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:23.000
to compare prices in cars in different countries and choose the cheapest one.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Naturally, he would pay much more for such a voyage than to buy it right on his own domestic market.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Now the situation is different.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You can actually go on the Internet and look at the prices in a number of countries.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:57.000
If your trip will pay off the difference in prices, you will buy in a country where this product will be cheaper.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Accordingly, what happens?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Since the consumer has the opportunity to compare, we cannot simply assign different prices on different markets without any explanations.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Otherwise, if the explanation is not followed, the consumer can switch to the product of another company.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Finally, globalization and standardization of brands.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:33.000
As we have already said, this is the most common price, this is the support of a common price education.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Accordingly, we need to say that since we want to get a global brand, we need common prices.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
However, companies rarely use a 100% common price.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:40:05.000
There is a certain corridor of plus or minus N% for the fact that there are changes in exchange rates, changes in costs, and so on.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
What else is there to say?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.000
What is the significant danger of using price differentiation?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:26.000
What I suggested as a more correct solution is that if you sell products at a low price on one market,

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:36.000
and at a high price on another market, there may be a situation when there is an intermediate link,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:48.000
which, having discovered this difference, will start buying products at a low price and reselling them at a high price.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Of course, you understand that the costs of moving this product to the high-priced market must be taken into account.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.000
But this problem exists and it is called parallel import.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:13.000
This is the situation that Procter & Gamble faced in 1998 on the Russian market.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:21.000
The company has been on the Russian market since 1995 with its Always product.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000
In 1998, this brand became the market leader.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I must say that Russian consumers accepted it very well.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:40.000
The company decided that its positioning would be the same as in Western Europe, and the prices would be the same as in Western Europe.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:51.000
While in a significant number of countries in Eastern Europe, the company's products were sold at prices lower than in Western Europe and Russia.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And what started to happen?

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Procter & Gamble Russia found that in early 1998, compared to the same period last year, the volume of purchases in Procter & Gamble Russia was reduced by 40%.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Due to what?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Due to the fact that parallel import from Poland began.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:28.000
And this flow began to be sold on open markets at prices lower than in retail networks.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.000
The share of the company's market in the Russian market has actually even increased.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
But there was a problem.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.000
The problem is that in this case, demotivation of white channels occurs.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Gray channels are involved, and white channels are demotivated.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I think this is a typical situation.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I suggest you turn off the presentation for a second and try to find a way to solve this problem.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000
So, what are the possibilities of solving the problem of parallel import?

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The first possibility is the pursuit of gray intermediaries in the judicial system.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
But this is certainly due to a very small number of companies.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
An example here may be Seiko.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Another possibility is to simply limit, or rather stop supplying products to the market, from where this parallel import flow comes from, if this market is not very significant for your company.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And finally, the third option is when you are already using marketing tools.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
What are the possibilities here?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
The first possibility is to try to vary the price a little.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:17.000
That is, to reduce it a little on the market with high prices, and at the same time raise it a little on the market with low prices.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:24.000
So that this very attractiveness of parallel import disappears.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
In other words, creating a price corridor.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Another possibility is to track these very gray channels.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And you will simply do the following.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:45.000
You will not serve the products that come to your market via gray channels.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:54.000
It must be said right away that this is possible if, for example, you are a household appliance manufacturer.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:03.000
You simply do not provide warranty service for this particular appliance.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:17.000
But in order to understand which appliance you are servicing, which you are not, you will have to place a small logo or something that will help you identify this product.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And finally, what other companies often do, although this may not be the most ideal way, is to make changes to the product itself.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000
But in this case, you understand that you are going to additional costs.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:41.000
And still, you will not be able to confuse the product intended for different markets.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Our next block, or the next aspect of the strategy, is international distribution of products.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
What companies need to pay attention to here?

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.000
First, you need to decide how you organize your sales activities in foreign markets.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And here we have the opportunity to organize direct sales.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
You can organize sales through intermediaries.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
And you can use so-called joint sales.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Although, of course, there are possible approaches when you combine all these options.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Let's look at the first fundamental decision on how to choose direct sales or sales through intermediaries.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Usually, when sales volumes in foreign markets are growing, companies tend to fully control all operations and gradually switch to direct sales, refusing intermediary services.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:50.000
You can solve this in advance, and this will be good in the case of a complicated specific product, for example, airplanes.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:57.000
In this case, it is very often about selling the product directly.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And in the event of problems, you send your specialists to this country to serve this aircraft.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
What else is very important?

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Still, companies that are just starting to work in international markets, often use intermediaries.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Of course, this is an opportunity to reduce the risks of working in an unknown business environment.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
And here you will have to make a number of decisions.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
That is, what type of intermediaries will you use for your product?

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Will it be retail intermediaries, or will it be a wholesale link, or something else?

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000
You will have to assess the availability and possibilities of different types of intermediaries.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:48:00.000
And then, the most important thing, you must clearly describe what functions will be in your hands, what functions will your intermediary perform.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:12.000
By the way, it is very important to control the brand's perception and associations that your brand will form in this market.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Therefore, very often, some aspects related to promotion, at least, you do not give fully to your intermediaries, but strive to do it together.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Then, of course, having distributed the functions, you will see what are the costs of performing these functions against the benefits that you see in the case of transferring these functions to an intermediary.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:48.000
And finally, naturally, you will have to assess what degree of control of the company over the intermediary you want to receive.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I would also like to draw your attention to this relatively new model of joint sales.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:08.000
This is a situation when your company can find a partner who already has ready-made sales channels on this market and enter these channels.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Naturally, on certain conditions. What does this give?

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000
This gives the most complete use of the capabilities of the already working sales channel.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
And, accordingly, risks are shared here, but also income is shared.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
In what cases does this work?

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
It works if you have compatible goods.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:37.000
In particular, here is an example of a joint use of the sales channel created by AVEN in China.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000
They have a sales staff of 85,000 people.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:54.000
And the Motel company has successfully entered this channel and promotes its products through this channel.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.000
These are Barbie dolls and Sesame Street.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:13.000
We must also pay attention to the fact that when to give up intermediaries and switch to a direct controlled trading branch.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.000
You can look here at the life cycle of the international distributor.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:29.000
We can see that very often, at first, the sales of your product on the market grow very quickly.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:36.000
But then, at some point, these rates of growth slow down and go into a plateau.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And in this situation, when the company discovers such a situation, it often changes its strategy on this market and switches to its own trading branch.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
After that, sales again very often begin to grow.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Undoubtedly, this problem occurs quite often.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And here, in fact, additional problems and disputes may arise, since the local distributor may not want to give up the market.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Therefore, companies should immediately prescribe this in the contract with the distributor.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:38.000
The possibility of either buying out his business or somehow transferring all rights to promote the sale of the company's goods will go to your company.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:52:00.000
If we have decided that we will work on an international market using an intermediary, we will need to approach the issue of choosing the ideal distributor very carefully.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
There are several rules.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:09.000
The first rule states that you should choose the distributor, not him or her.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Why?

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Because there are often situations when, for example, at some international exhibitions, fairs, the company is simply bypassed by potential distributors.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:46.000
But it turns out that they are representatives of a competing company, and they will not be interested in developing your product, but will rather supplement the existing assortment chain with additional goods.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:53:00.000
The second aspect is that you need to find a distributor who is able to develop your product, and not just a distributor who has a constant circle of customers.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:11.000
This is a situation when we can see that the company is trying to rip off the low-hanging fruit.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:23.000
This is not good. In this case, your sales will really enter this stage of stagnation very quickly, and sales revenues will not grow.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
There is a clear danger here.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Therefore, you need to build a long-term relationship with the distributor as a long-term partner, and in no case consider him as a temporary assistant.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:45.000
What allows you to show the distributor that you really consider him as a serious partner?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Perhaps, in the contract, you must immediately prescribe the opportunities for training your partner's personnel, joint advertising and joint shares.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.000
That is, everything that will show your partner the seriousness of your relationship.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Then you need to allocate a sufficient amount of resources, money and ideas for the conquest of this new market.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Otherwise, your product's market will not develop, because it is unlikely that your distributor will be so interested in your product that he will solve these issues for you.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
The next aspect is very important.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:39.000
It is very important to constantly control the marketing policy of the distributor from the very beginning.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Otherwise, you can get into an unpleasant situation, which, for example, happened with the company LVMH in the Russian market,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:54.000
when they sold their products through retail traders like Arbat Prestige.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:05.000
On the one hand, the luxury brands of LVMH, and on the other hand, the pricing policy of a retail trader are completely incompatible.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Therefore, LVMH was forced to leave this network, and its brands are still not presented there.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:23.000
The next aspect, the next rule is to make sure that the distributor provides you with detailed information about the market and the financial results of sales.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:34.000
This is important for you to correct your actions in time and, perhaps, to respond to any negative changes in the market situation.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Finally, it is necessary to create a system of communication between your distributors from various national markets.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:51.000
This will help to flow of ideas, and this, in the end, can improve the quality of sales in different countries.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:01.000
And finally, the final element that we must consider is international communications, how to use them.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Of course, if we are talking about the fact that our products are not yet very well known or completely unknown on international markets,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
we will need to create awareness about our product.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:28.000
This means that we may have to use all available channels of communication, starting with advertising and ending with, for example, Internet advertising.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Although, very often you will face the fact that advertising will not be very accessible due to its high cost.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
What should you consider?

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.000
We have important factors of influence that will affect the communication process.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:55.000
First of all, these are language differences, other cultural differences that we have already talked about, the difference in legal requirements.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:06.000
In particular, there are different laws in different countries that regulate advertising and, for example, sales.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Therefore, it will be necessary to clearly consider what you can do in which country and what you cannot.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:23.000
The difference in competition conditions can also seriously affect how and what you will convey to your foreign consumer.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:38.000
In particular, if you say in all your advertising messages and all your communications that you are the number one brand, the only quality or the only wonderful choice for the consumer,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:45.000
but in fact you are not number one on the market, the consumer will not understand you.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:58:02.000
But if this is confirmed by statistics, if, as in the case of Holland and Heineken, this brand is really the undisputed leader of the market, then yes, you can declare such things.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:14.000
And how can we decide what approaches to use? Standardized or adapted communications, in particular advertising?

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:26.000
If we are talking about standardized advertising, then this is certainly a plus in terms of saving costs, in terms of improving the quality of advertising in certain countries,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:36.000
because sometimes there may not be advertising agencies in the country that are able to make very high-quality advertising.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:50.000
And then you use a common product, an advertising product that was developed for your brand and, accordingly, aimed at a global audience.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And the most important thing is that it prevents the generation of incompatible advertising appeals for different countries.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:07.000
What companies use this approach very clearly? These are companies like Nike, Intel, Coca-Cola.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:20.000
On the other hand, adapted advertising allows you to take into account all possible differences in the specifics of the country's markets, and especially cultural and linguistic differences.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
And, as we have already said, this is very important if there are restrictions on advertising.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And here I would like to give you an example of a company, an advertising company, Desodorants Impulse,

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:47.000
which initially assumed that the central idea of ​​these ads would be that when a woman uses a Desodorant Spray Impulse,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:52.000
no man will be able to resist the temptation and will definitely give her flowers.

01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:04.000
But how did the company use the differences? In the first advertising videos aimed at different countries, the company used, in particular, in French advertising,

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:14.000
a man bought flowers, in Italian, for example, he tore flowers. And for the first time, the company sought to show these cultural differences.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:22.000
But over time, the company switched to standardized advertising.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And yet, companies strive to use mixed advertising on foreign markets, which allows, on the one hand, to develop a single concept,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:46.000
but on the other hand, taking into account linguistic, cultural and other differences, to make advertising, communication, which will be understandable, which will be close to the consumer on foreign markets.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:56.000
International marketing

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Thus, today we managed to answer a number of significant questions of international marketing.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:11.000
We have dealt with what are the benefits of internationalization versus risks.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:17.000
We tried to answer the question of what are the ways for companies to the global market.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:28.000
We developed this topic using the experience of foreign companies and looking at what opportunities Russian companies have.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:37.000
And then we looked at the tool that you can use to develop international marketing strategies.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Thank you for your attention. Goodbye.
