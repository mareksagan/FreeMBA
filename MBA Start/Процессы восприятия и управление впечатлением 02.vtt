00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
The next element of the metaprogram that arises when the impression is formed is the reference, the focus on which a person focuses.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
As for the reference, it can be of three types.

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
The first is the internal reference, that is, a person is interested in what he will do.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
A person, as an active being, is interested in how it will affect him, what will be the relationship with him, what consequences he will get.

00:33.000 --> 00:45.000
That is, the internal reference is me, the world is centered around me, and therefore, if you give me a proposal, I am not interested in its benefits for the Motherland, it is interested in the benefits specifically for me.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
And I have to talk to you in this language because I came to sign a contract with you.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
In addition to the internal, there are also external references. There are two types of external references.

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
The first type is the orientation to others.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
That is, if I sign this contract, what will my partner think of me?

01:11.000 --> 01:22.000
But if for some reason you came to me with this contract, not to my partner, and maybe you already came to him and, accordingly, they rejected your contract, and now you came to me,

01:22.000 --> 01:33.000
here it is important, even not my desire, not my attitude, I want to understand how other people feel about what you offer.

01:34.000 --> 01:45.000
In principle, a very interesting position, again, if you remember the saying that a fool learns from his mistakes, and a wise man learns from the mistakes of others.

01:45.000 --> 01:53.000
This is the position of wisdom, and a person in the reference to others, he tries to be wise.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
That is, of course, you will not offer me anything new, it's all already been.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Let me see how others reacted to this, what were their consequences, what were their approaches.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
And after that, I will already think whether I need to sign a contract with you.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
This is a very good position in terms of stabilization.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Perhaps.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
But on the other hand, this position is very fraught and difficult from the point of view of business and risk.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Business is constant change, constant changes.

02:26.000 --> 02:42.000
And if I wait until the market stabilizes, until any product stands, then I can not only lose my niche, I can just go bankrupt, because there are already brands.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Who are you? You are a new company, you just appear.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
And so this orientation to others is an orientation of caution.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
But caution, of course, should be within reasonable limits.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
The best way is not to do anything, then you will not make a mistake in anything, then you do not need to do business.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
The other side of the external reference is the context.

03:09.000 --> 03:18.000
You come to me with any contract, and I have an understanding that today my business is flourishing,

03:18.000 --> 03:28.000
that today the sales that I carry out, the products that I offer, the services that my company does are already at a good level.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Here you ask me something new.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
How much does this fit into the context that exists?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
How much does it fit into my reputation?

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
How much will my reputation contribute to the promotion of your offers on the market?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
How much not?

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
In this case, this external reference is oriented to take into account all these circumstances.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
Again, it is not enough that I want, it is not enough that my intuition tells me, from the point of view of the internal reference.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
But the external circumstances are such.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
The context is not favorable today in order to realize your offer.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
And even if my intuition tells me that it would not interfere, but I am oriented to the context of the reference.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
And so I do not like your offer.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
In order to have the opportunity to sign any other contracts, to form any other impression,

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
it is necessary to understand what is referential, what is significant for this person, for my partner in negotiations.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
And again, try to speak in his language.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
If I see that a person is externally referential in context, let's talk about the context.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
How will it fit into the context of the business that exists now?

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
If I see that a person is internally referential, let's talk about the internal references.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
How much will it contribute to your growth on the market, to the growth of you as an entrepreneur?

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
How much will it testify to your ambitions, to your requests, to your predispositions?

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
Again, it will always be pleasant for a person to be spoken to in the accents that are understandable to him.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
And these accents, in some way or another, will be in demand and mutual understanding will be achieved.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
The next element concerning the metaprogram is related to time.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
We have already discussed the issue of world classification, that one of the ways of classification is by time.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
I allocate information on the time aspects, what I do, when I do.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
But time is a very significant factor in our life, and therefore we all live in some time.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
We are all late somewhere, we all don't have time for something, we all don't have enough time,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
we all work 25 hours a day, we would like to work 26 hours a day.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
This is a very important factor that is always missing.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Therefore, as for the time aspects, they are separated separately.

06:09.000 --> 06:18.000
And when we talk about metaprograms about time, then here we need to identify at what time a person is oriented.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Someone is oriented to the past.

06:21.000 --> 06:31.000
Ford did this, Bill Gates did that, IBM did that, and so on.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
This person lives in the past, he lives in the achievements of the past.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
He remembers all these achievements that were made, he remembers what mistakes were made.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
If IBM was developing, then the problems with Apple, Apple Macintosh Company, are completely different.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
And this is a person who needs, when you offer him an offer, to find an analogue in the past.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Here is the analogue thinking.

06:58.000 --> 07:09.000
Yes, there was such a situation, and it was because Apple Macintosh Company refused to work on the market in this world, IBM bypassed them.

07:10.000 --> 07:19.000
When you talk to a person about his usual orientation in time, and give him his favorite examples of the time frame,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
then, of course, this person will listen to you.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
Other people are oriented to the future.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
What will I achieve if I implement these or other positions?

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Not now, not in the past, what will my future be?

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
And when you come to him with a contract, where everything is calculated,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
as regards the present situation of affairs,

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
what is proven, that this will not in any way worsen what is now,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
he is interested.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And what will be in the future?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And you are not prepared to give this future picture.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
You start to improvise, and so on.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
And the negotiations, not that it goes into a deadlock, but the parties remain dissatisfied.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
You brought me all the information.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Other people are oriented to the present.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
The past is already there, the future is not there yet, and it is not known whether it will be there.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
But the present is there.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
You came to me, and, accordingly, your company, my company is interested in you,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
your company is interested in cooperating with ours.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
This is today.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
And, accordingly, I do not need to build an air castle, which I will be in the future.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I need to talk about how good it was in the past.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
What will change for me today, if I implement your contract?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
This is the time orientation.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
It often disappears, and, by the way, very often leads to a misunderstanding of people with each other.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Someone is talking about the future,

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
and the other is worried about the problems that are now following him, which he needs to solve.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Someone is worried about the current situation.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
He is interested in the fact that today he needs to transfer a certain payment, but there is no money.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Yes, they may be tomorrow, but today I do not transfer.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Yes, they were yesterday, but today I do not have.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Therefore, the time orientation is such a painful thing.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
24 hours a day.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
We all live in the present.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Each of us has a future that we want, and there is a past,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
in which there are both pleasant and unpleasant things.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Depending on what the person focuses on,

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
depending on what he distinguishes from these aspects,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
this is a way of his accentuation of information.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
And if a person is all the time immersed in past failures,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
and you draw him future prospects,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
he does not hear you, because he is all there.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
If a person is immersed in all-time problems,

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
here is the tax, here is the wrong payment from the bank,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
and you tell him about what you remember,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
he is not interested, because he has problems now.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
The time orientation is really very painful,

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
just because there are all-time problems that need to be solved,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
and you take my time.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
In principle, you need to understand these issues.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
If you enter the same time orientation with a person,

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
then you are very close to getting contacts and interactions with him.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
But in addition to the orientation of the past-present-future or the timeline,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
there is also such an aspect as the duration of time.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
People differ in their attitude to time.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Someone lives in time,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
that is, he always knows how much time is now,

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
he always controls how much time he needs to get somewhere,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
how much time is left to complete the annual report,

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
how much time should pass until you send me the necessary information.

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
This is a person who lives in so-called through time.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
In the course of time, a person constantly controls the time he has.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
This person is pedantic, scrupulous, punctual.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
This is what is called the accuracy and politeness of kings.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
For him, if you come to a contract,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
we say that within a year we will get such results.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
These are not words.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
During the year, when?

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
December 31, January 1, October, when the financial year,

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
this is a person who needs a clear indication of time, up to the hours.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
No matter how funny it sounds.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Very often profitable contracts are broken

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
precisely because I just ask you honestly,

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
tell me how many weeks, months, years will I get the result?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I need a number.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
And you start saying that I don't think it will take a long time.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I'm not interested in these long names, long speeches,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
which we will talk about a little later.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I'm interested in specifics.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
There are other people who are involved in time

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
and in the sense that they do not notice it.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
These are the people who say,

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
so, morning, well, good, we need to do something,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
oh, it's already lunch, okay, let's continue,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
oh, the worker is already finished,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
well, nothing, we'll do it tomorrow.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
These are people who, as they say,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
do not observe happy hours,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
but these are the people who cannot be put down.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
These are not punctual people.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I'm not saying that a person will not do something,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
that this person will not succeed.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
But this is a person for whom time is the main perspective.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
The main result can be for him.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And it doesn't matter when I achieve it.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Today or in 13 years.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
The main thing is that I have achieved it.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And where was the time?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
We still live, we haven't died yet.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
If there is such a time,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
no matter what, and a person who is punctual,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
no matter how much,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
these people will never agree.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
The next element of the program is the so-called persuaders.

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
For each person, it is always desirable to repeat something,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
to base something on something, to pay attention to something.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
Each of us reacts differently to these repetitions.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
In this regard, we can highlight several groups of persuaders,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
repetitions that need to be done.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Persuaders can be based on intensity.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Someone needs to constantly, intensely, persistently indicate.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
You have to do it because, because, because.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
And the more you are persistent,

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
the more aggressive you will be to indicate,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
the more intense you will be doing it,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
the more a person will be convinced that,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
if you insist so,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
it means that you have already checked it,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
and it means that you are really ready to get down to business

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
and are sure that the result will be.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
This is, let's say, from the section

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
of impudence, the second part.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
But if you are so sure that you are saying,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
if you constantly demonstrate it,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
well, okay, let's try.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
But you understand that not everyone can be affected by this.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
Usually, if a person, well, let's say,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
is not very active, not very confident,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
not very ambitious, then intensity affects him.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
In fact, it's pressure.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I press you in order to get the result I need.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
If a person is self-sufficient,

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
then this intensity can have a completely different effect.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Why are you pressing me, why are you not insisting?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Why are you teaching me?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And, accordingly, with such a person,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
to speak to such kind of persuaders is an absolutely

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
correct way for the contract to be broken.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
For other people,

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
the number of times of repetition is the persuader.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
If you talk a lot about this contract,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
if you bring recommendations,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
what are recommendations?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
There is one of the quantitative persuaders.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
The more recommendations you bring,

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
the more it can be a sign that you can really be dealt with.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
And, accordingly, you see how many companies

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
have interaction with your company,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
and they are all more or less satisfied,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
judging by the recommendations you gave me.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
In this case, this number indicates that you are repeating.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
But, again, as for persuaders,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
that you need to be very careful with them.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
It is not for nothing that it is highlighted at the end of the program.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
If you have caught the person's persuader incorrectly,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
then your persistence can have a completely different

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
representation, a completely different attitude,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
because it can be perceived against you.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
The next killer is purity.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
How often do you repeat?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
You can say every word,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
but my company has not let anyone down yet.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
You can say this at the beginning and at the end.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You can say this once.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It is perceived differently.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
If you are constantly cleaning,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
it means that maybe something is wrong here.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
If you are a company that does not need recommendations,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
it means that the less you repeat about it,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
the more it is an extra argument in your favor.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
But, again, the situation here depends on

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
what kind of metaprogram is convincing for another person.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
If, on the contrary, this person is convincing

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
and acts only on the purity of repetition,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
then you really need to speak as often as possible.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
If this person is considered convincing as intensity,

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
then here your purity will be an extra way

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
to influence the listener with a completely negative approach.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
The next killer is period.

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
How often do you present evidence of what needs to be done?

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
In this case, it can be about

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
if you have given one argument,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
another argument, after each of these arguments,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
after completing a certain cycle of evidence

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
in the presentation of your contract,

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
you give arguments after you need to conclude the contract,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
this is a certain periodicity.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
It can be excessive, it can be insufficient.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It all depends on the person again.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
What does he need?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
In frequent, periodic reinforcements,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
or in rare, but circumstantial,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
how often do you need to reinforce your actions?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
By giving all arguments and only after that

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
giving another confirmation of your right,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
or by giving half of the arguments,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
giving a preliminary confirmation,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
and the other half, giving a subsequent confirmation.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
And finally, another killer can be an interval.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
How much time does it take

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
for you to repeat a certain piece of information?

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
If this interval is short enough for a person

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
and you see that the person starts to doubt,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
to think, then increase this interval.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You need to be very careful with the killer,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
probably as well as with time and motivation.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
Because if you incorrectly record the killer,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
then, accordingly, in this situation,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
you will obviously lose the situation.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
Very often, even when the analysis of the metaprogram is carried out,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
the killer is not even mentioned as the most difficult to catch link,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
because the killer does not come with experience.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And still, you need to be a really good master of negotiations,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
a very good master of forming impressions

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
in order to catch on the convincers.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
But if you caught on the convincers,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
then your way of communication,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
your way of managing the impression,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
your way of forming the impression

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
will be 80% successful.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
The convincer is a very strong thing,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
but at the same time, it is very thin.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
So, we have now considered seven main elements of the metaprogram,

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
analyzed different approaches in these elements.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Again, I draw your attention to the fact that this model, this scheme,

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
does not mean that there are people who only need to deal with the metaprogram by classification,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
there are those who only need to deal with it by reference, there are those who need to deal with it by time.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
We are all living beings,

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
and naturally, each of us has these leading elements in itself.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Each of us has its own way of working with information,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
each of us has its own classification of the world,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
each of us has its own style of organization of information,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
its own leading representative systems,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
each of us has its own focus of comparison,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
its own motivation, its own reference,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
each of us has its own time,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
we are either included in it or live through time,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
each of us has its own convincers.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
For a person, some of these points in the metaprogram are dominant and significant.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
When we communicate with a person,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
when we collect information about our communication partners,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
about those partners with whom we will interact and work with,

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
we need to try to highlight the metaprogram elements significant for them.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Because we can make a mistake somewhere,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
we can make a mistake in the focus of comparison,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
but we can be very correct and get into the style of organization of information

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
and deal with the leading representative systems.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We can make a mistake in the classification of the world,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
but we can get into the winner very accurately.

21:43.000 --> 21:54.000
If we really find ourselves able to fix a way of fixing his attention to information,

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
a way of influencing his impression,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
a way of forming and managing the impression he will receive,

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
then we will have a great opportunity,

22:04.000 --> 22:11.000
a great effort, a great possibility to achieve mutual understanding

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
and to form the impression we need and to get the result we need.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
We get a good result both when we perceive, communicate and communicate.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
We become what is called a pleasant interlocutor.

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
A pleasant interlocutor is the interlocutor whose opponent understands,

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
who speaks with him in the same language.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
How can we apply these or other approaches?

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Metaprogramming

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
So, we have talked about metaprogramming as a tool for creating impressions.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Naturally, now we will be interested in a practical question.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
How can we manage these impressions?

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
How can we form the impression we need in a person?

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
How can we avoid giving up the formation of the wrong impression about another person?

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
One of the ways, as we have already mentioned, is to understand what metaprogramming is,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
what we should focus our attention on, what we should pay attention to,

23:33.000 --> 23:39.000
and how we can structure and present the information.

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
On the other hand, we have started talking about perception today.

23:46.000 --> 23:56.000
We have already mentioned that perception is a way to get a holistic picture of what surrounds us.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
When we talk about social perception based on psychological perception,

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
in this case we are talking about how we form an idea of social environment,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
of people around us.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
And here we need to return to the representative system.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
And now we should return to where we started.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
How do we form an impression?

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
Impressions about people are usually formed as a result of interaction with them.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
And the language plays a big role here, the verbal communication, which we have already mentioned.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Of course, in addition to the language, there is also non-verbal communication, which we have already mentioned.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
But, as we have agreed, we devote most of our time to verbal communication.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
What is a language?

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
A language is a way of presenting our experience.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
This is a very important element, because as research shows,

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
as the research of psychologists, linguists, and specialists in cognitive psychology shows,

25:01.000 --> 25:10.000
a language arises from the designation of our direct sensations, our direct perception.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
We have some pictures of perception that we recognize,

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
that we pay attention to, that we have in our memory,

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
and, accordingly, we compare them with what we know and what we do not know.

25:23.000 --> 25:33.000
It is from all these psychological structures, images, that we create our inner sensory world.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
This is our world, and usually we see our world, or hear, or feel,

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
depending on what representative system is leading for us, as we have already mentioned.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
But a human being is a social being,

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
and therefore we need to convey our feelings, our perception to other people.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
In the end, we need to interact with them, to get in touch with them,

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
to get the results that we are satisfied with.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
In order to do this, as a result of evolution,

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
a cognitive formation was formed, like a language.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
A human speech, which is based, of course, on the physiology of the language,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
as well as on the vocal cords,

26:22.000 --> 26:30.000
was created to designate the inner sensory experience.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
I will repeat it again, because it is an important aspect.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
A human being has no other sensations and perceptions,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
except what has passed through our sensory organs.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
Through what we have seen, heard, felt,

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
tasted, smelled, felt tactile, felt pain, felt pressure, and so on.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
A human being is in the world around him, and this world is acting on him.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
The stimuli of this world are acting on him.

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
These stimuli leave in the psyche of a human being some traces, some mental images.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
A human being is a social being,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
he has got an opportunity to exchange these mental images.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
As for mental images, they are present in any mammal,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
in any animal that has a developed brain.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
A monkey also has visual images of the brain.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
A monkey has visual images of the world.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
A rat has visual images of the world.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
A mouse has visual images of the world.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
They have brains, they have vision,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
and, accordingly, when I look at the world around me,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
the corresponding images of this world remain in my head.

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
But as for rats, monkeys, mice, birds,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
these are their images.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
They exist in them, and they cannot transmit these images.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
Here is the main difference between animals and humans.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
Animals have visual images, they have vision.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
They have auditory images, they have hearing.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
And, in a kinesthetic way, the smell of the same dog

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
cannot be compared to the smell of a human being,

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
because for a dog, the smell is one of the ways of survival,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
one of the ways of orientation.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
But all these images in animals are their property.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
And an animal, with all its will, cannot transmit them.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
It cannot teach its offspring,

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
it cannot pass on to other animals from the same species,

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
simply because these are images that are represented in their psyche, in their brain.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
A human being is the only one, as we know now,

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
there are, of course, disputes, but I don't think we will go into these disputes now,

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
a human being is the only living creature on Earth

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
that is able to transmit its visual images

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
using the language of verbal forms, concepts, and terms.

29:08.000 --> 29:15.000
But the main thing here is that the language, speech, and concepts

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
arise on the basis of those images, those impressions

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
that a person has, that a person has developed.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
This is the so-called process of encoding information.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
A person has a certain image, I encode it in words,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I can't just encode the whole image,

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
and again, we understand perfectly well that there are a lot of colors and shades,

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
there are a huge number of different sounds,

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
different varieties of notes that a person can perceive,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
we cannot pass it on.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Concepts are some kind of generalizations

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
with which we pass on certain actions.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
Using concepts, I try to capture the images that I have,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
and after that I speak in words and pass them on to another person.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
Another person hears the word, and in order to understand

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
the content that is behind this word,

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
he must decode my word, that is, translate

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
this concept that he heard from me.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
We perceive the world and can judge it

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
only based on our senses.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Accordingly, using language, I call a concept

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
my mental image, I pass this mental image on to another person,

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
and if another person wants to understand what I see,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
what I feel, what I perceive,

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
he must decode my word in ways that are understandable to him.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
So that his understanding is limited not by the form of words,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
but by the experience, so that he experiences the same

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
that I said to him in words,

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
so that he can feel and communicate to my experience.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
This is the function of language,

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
and all the verbalism is in the sense that I code my experiences

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
in words in order to pass them on to another person,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
and he codes them in order to communicate to my experiences.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Naturally, when we talk about this,

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
there are always mistakes.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Mistakes in coding and decoding.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
As for these mistakes, they were studied and studied

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
by representatives of cognitive science,

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
the same Grindr, the same Diels, Bateson,

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
and three basic ways of distorting information were identified.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that this distortion of information is not conscious,

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
I am not distorting it on purpose to hide something from you.

31:54.000 --> 32:02.000
This distortion of information is simply due to the fact that I am trying to put my various experiences,

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
visual, auditory, kinesthetic, into words.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Again, it's an abstraction.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
And then you try to fill this abstraction with living feelings again

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
in order to communicate to my experiences.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Here are distortions related to generalization,

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
distortions related to distortion, and information related to omission.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
Generalization of information is an abstraction

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
when we say, for example, table.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
And under this concept of a table we get desks,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
and dining tables, and a table for meetings,

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
and, let's say, a table for a laptop,

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
a score, if it lies in front of the conductor.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
This is all that falls under the category of a table.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
One word, an abstract word,

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
but it encompasses a huge number of specific images.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
If we say the word table,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
we understand that it's a device

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
on which something can be placed.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
But what kind of device is it?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
What is it made of?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Iron, wooden, plastic,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
folding, massive.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
All this is what we didn't say.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Any word is a generalization

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
that hides a lot of nuances.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
This is the essence of the language.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Language is a generalization

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
that helps us understand the general meaning of words

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
and try to convey to each other those or other words.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
But any generalization, as you understand,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
levels out the details.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Tables can be different.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
The next element of information change

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
that occurs with decoding and decoding

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
is distortion of our experience.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
As for distortion,

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
we can't formulate for ourselves

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
what we see, what we feel,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
what we are guided by.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
We pick up a generalized word,

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
pass it on, decode it,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
and perceive it in our own way.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Some elements were lost,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
some elements were added.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Let's recall constructivism,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
what we talked about when talking about perception.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
That's why we were considering the theory of perception

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
in order to make it clear

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
what difficulties arise when controlling the perception

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
and how to organize this control.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
In addition to distortion of experience,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
there is also omission of information.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
We said the word table.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
But, let's say,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
we may have meant a table

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
with which Alexander Pushkin wrote his immortal works,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
and so on.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And the other one, to whom we said it,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
perceived it as a dinner table

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
with which he had his dinner today.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
In fact, he perceived this word correctly.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Thus, omission, omission of information

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
that is big and significant for the person

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
who is transmitting it, was made.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
He was talking about the Almighty,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
and you are thinking about the dinner.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
It makes no sense to say who is right and who is wrong.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
When we talk about something,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
we often see our own image.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
And we think that we are transmitting this image.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
The problem is that the word,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
being abstract,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
does not reflect nuances.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And another person, perceiving something,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
the same word,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
begins to give it its meaning,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
its nuances that are significant for him.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Both are right, both understand what they are talking about.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
But these nuances are omitted.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And the main thing is in these nuances.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Remember, we talked about metaprograms.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
We talk about the same thing.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
We talk about the same information.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
But the way it is transmitted,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
the way it is focused,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
leads to the fact that

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
the same information can be used as a win-win situation,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
or it can be used in such a way

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
that you lose all interest in further analysis,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
further discussion, further consideration of the contract.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
So, in order to clarify the communication

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
about the meaning of metaprograms,

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
the meaning of metaprograms is to clarify

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
the interaction that occurs between us.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
So that you understand what I wanted to say,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
and you put the meaning that I wanted to convey into my words.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
There are different ways to do this,

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
which we will now consider.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
And as for these methods,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
they were developed by representatives of cognitive science,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
by Grinder, Bates, and Diltz.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
And, accordingly, their purpose,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
their goal in these instruments,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
which we will now talk about,

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
is to try to get rid of all the difficulties

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
that arise when generalizing information,

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
when omitting information, and when distorting it.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
What difficulties usually arise

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
when the correct understanding

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
of what is being said to a person is distorted?

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Because, again, I would like to draw your attention to the fact

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
that difficulties in perception,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
difficulties in forming perceptions arise

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
not only because I consciously want to mislead you,

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
they arise in the case when I sincerely want you to understand me,

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
to understand exactly what I want to convey to you.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
The problem is that

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
in their speech people often use

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
non-specific nouns of noun and place of origin.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
For example, as is usually our favorite saying,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
that sellers are obsessive,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
goods are of poor quality,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
companies deceive their buyers,

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
and this is the norm of business.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
Again, look, there is a certain statement,

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
it is procedural, as we already know from the point of view of classification,

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
but here non-specific nouns of noun are used.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
Accordingly, let's assume that we have come to sign a contract with a person

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
and he gives us this kind of statement.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
After all, any non-specific statement is correct

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
in some aspects, in some places, in some circumstances.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
Accordingly, our task is to strengthen the understanding with a person

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
and avoid the fears that he wants to say

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
and create the right impression of him.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
In this regard, we must,

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
in terms of forming impressions,

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
ask clarifying questions.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
If we come across non-specific nouns of noun and place of origin,

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
then the goal of the questions is to restore the lost information,

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
to clarify the experience.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
After all, in fact, if a person says this,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
then, accordingly, he had some experience

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
when both sellers were obsessive,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
and goods were of poor quality,

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
and, accordingly, the company wanted to deceive the buyers.

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
But he does not want to present this directly as a victim of circumstances.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
And he says that it happens.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
And when he says this, you will not look at him, it really happens.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
In this regard, we must ask questions to clarify

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
who exactly, what exactly,

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
what specific circumstances concern him.

39:44.000 --> 39:51.000
At the same time, it should be noted that there are two approaches.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
We use non-specific nouns of noun

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
to designate people, places, things.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Remember the metaprogram and information classification.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
So, if we do not want to say specifically what kind of people,

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
in what place, what kind of goods, what kind of thing,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
we use non-specific nouns.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
It is not specific.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I do not seem to offend you,

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
but on the other hand, I express my concerns.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
So, in order to specify the appropriate circumstances,

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
we need to ask a clarifying question.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Here is the statement.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Sellers are obsessive.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Let's ask what kind of sellers they are.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
Maybe a person has experience in communicating with the sellers of a jewelry store.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
And we came to sell cars.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
As for cars, he bought his jeep and is very satisfied

40:45.000 --> 40:51.000
because the sellers told him everything he wanted

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
and sold him the things he really needed.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
In this situation, it is necessary to point out to a person

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
that he is doing the wrong generalization.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
And if he makes a conversation with you,

41:05.000 --> 41:13.000
it means that he sees you as the same person as someone from his past experience.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
The statement, your goods are of poor quality.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
You can ask what exactly the goods are.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Maybe we are really talking about computers.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
You had a sad experience five years ago,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
working with a computer company that put Chinese computers

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
under the mask of Hewlett Packard computers.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
They naturally broke down, and you were at a loss.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
But we must clarify again what an unpleasant experience

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
a person has with events.

41:40.000 --> 41:47.000
In order to reveal the situation and say that we supply those computers,

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
here are the documents, certificates, licenses.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
And, accordingly, to dispel suspicions that he will again attack these robberies,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
which again attacked five years ago.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Many companies deceive buyers.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Again, you can ask, who is being deceived?

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
What buyers?

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
And, accordingly, again, what is the experience related to?

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
If this is where the distrust of my company is hidden,

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
let's figure out what data is not interesting in the company,

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
what balance should be given in order to dispel the fears that a person has.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
This is what concerns the classification of people, places and things,

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
and, accordingly, clarifying questions that can be asked here.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
This is all that you see on the first part of the slide.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
But as for the specific names of nouns and nouns,

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
there is another very interesting feature of the Russian language,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
which is nominalization.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
Nominalization is a philological term that means

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
the use of a word with a processual meaning as a noun

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
when the processuality disappears.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
The process is a verb, we have already talked about this.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
The noun is a noun, the noun is a result.

43:08.000 --> 43:14.000
Naturally, there is no processual connection between the verb action and the noun.

43:14.000 --> 43:24.000
Nevertheless, if a word has a nominal meaning,

43:24.000 --> 43:32.000
then there is some fear about the processuality of events.

43:33.000 --> 43:40.000
There is a standard test to determine whether this part of the speech is nominalization or not.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
This test is philological, again.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
That is, you need to ask the question, can this be put into a wheelbarrow?

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
For example, trust, well-being, reliability, abstractness.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
Naturally, this is a general concept that cannot be put into a wheelbarrow.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
You can put bricks, houses, trunks, walls into a wheelbarrow.

44:01.000 --> 44:09.000
But abstract concepts like trust, tenderness, quality cannot be put into a wheelbarrow.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Accordingly, if you have encountered nominalization,

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
then you need to understand what process is hidden under it.

44:16.000 --> 44:25.000
Because the nominal noun cannot be touched, heard, seen.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
We cannot pass the nominal noun through our representative systems.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
This is very important, which we are already talking about.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
In order to decode a word, we must relate it to our sensory experience.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Nominalization is a verb-noun.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
Naturally, it is not sensory, it is a certain action.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
It is not something that passes through our sensory organs.

44:49.000 --> 44:55.000
We cannot relate it to our perception, to our sensory experience.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
Therefore, we need to put this nominalization into action,

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
or clarify what is meant.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
As for clarifying questions, usually there are questions.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
Where, when, how, what do you mean?

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
The goal of the question is to transform a significant phenomenon

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
back into a process, into a verb, into an action.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
Everything we talked about in the classification of information in the world.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
What can be brought as an example?

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
For example, we are not sure about the quality of your products.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Nominalization is about quality.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
I cannot smell quality, touch it, and so on.

45:41.000 --> 45:46.000
We clarify how you want to believe in this.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
What is the quality expressed in?

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
Thus, we give a person the opportunity to translate his suspicions,

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
his difficulties from nominalization into our sensory sensations.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
Smell, taste, mass, packaging, size.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
That is, specific actions that we can discuss.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
We left the abstraction of quality.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
It can be the quality of the purchase, the quality of the sale, the quality of the service.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
And now we get the specifics.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
The specifics are what is discussed, what is agreed upon, what is agreed upon.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
Again, the argument is the strength tested by eternity.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
What is eternity?

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
Again, this is a kind of nominalization, you cannot put it into action.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
And we can clarify in what conditions this strength is tested.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
In relation to what?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
For how long?

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
None of us lives forever.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
For some, eternity is a guaranteed repair for three years.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
For some, eternity is a guaranteed repair for two months.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
What exactly worries you?

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
The fact that we do not specify a specific time?

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Let's discuss this.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
The fact that you once faced circumstances that guaranteed you eternity,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
and everything broke the next day.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Let's clarify what worries you and discuss it.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
We will leave the nominalization and again consider what we specifically get.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
We return to the specifics.

47:18.000 --> 47:25.000
Well, again, our relations are full of trust or our relations are safe.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
What does it mean to be full of trust?

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
What is trust?

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
What is safety?

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
What do you mean by this?

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
What are you, as an opponent, worried about?

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Who do you trust?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Who trusts you?

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
What do you trust?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Let's clarify the nominalization.

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
Let's go back from the substantive to the process.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.000
This is how the work and formation of changes in the correct perception takes place,

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
when we use specific names of the substantive places of ownership.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Both the classification of things by people and places of ownership,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and the work with nominalizations.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
Please note that the nominalization is used very often, especially in the speech of politicians.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
When it is said that the welfare of the people is getting better,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
people, children, and so on.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
What is better?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
How to increase it?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
To whom to increase it?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
The people are also a stretch.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
And, accordingly, when this nominalization begins to be implemented,

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
the political actors are influenced and look pretty pale.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
But, as they say, politics is politics.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
We are interested in our commercial issues, commercial proposals.

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
And, accordingly, now we know how to achieve mutual understanding

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
in the case when a person uses specific names of the substantive places of ownership.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
But this is only the first part of the question,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
because there are other approaches besides this.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
For example, the use of specific verbs.

48:51.000 --> 48:59.000
Specific verbs are also a very widespread way of distorting information.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
But we all know the remarkable feature of Russia,

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
this Crimean people steal.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
This is already, as they say, used for the second century.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
Everyone uses it, but it is not a specific verb.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Who steals?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
What is stolen?

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Where is stolen?

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Who is stolen?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
And what does it have to do with the fact that in Russia

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
someone has the contract that you propose to me to conclude?

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
When a specific verb is used, it must also be concretized and simplified.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
In this case, the goal of the question will be to determine

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
the complex equivalence of behavior or process.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
What is meant by this specificness?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
What process?

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
What is the duration?

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
What is the duration?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
What are the circumstances?

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
And the most natural question we should ask in this situation is

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
how exactly?

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
How exactly are they stealing?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
How exactly are they calculating?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Where are they writing?

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Where are they washing?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
And so on.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
As for verbs,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
verbs are usually actions,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
which we have already discussed.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
Moreover, the details of the action itself can vary.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
Along with this, the behavior that this action indicates also varies.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
And the main thing is implied.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I use a specific verb.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
I mean only circumstances.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I mean my sad experience.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
I mean the descriptions that your company gives to my security services

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
or those whom I trust who have already worked with you.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
And here, accordingly, it is necessary to clarify

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
what is meant by this verb.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
For example,

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
there is a common statement that arises in the field of activity

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
of a specialist in the field of human resources of HR,

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
who cannot understand why his employees are constantly being fired.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
My employees rely on me.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
They rely.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
This is a completely negative verb.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Let's start.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
What do they rely on?

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
They rely on the fact that you will fire them.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
This is undisputable.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
You have this result.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
They rely on the fact that you will promote them.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
These are questions, otherwise they would not be fired.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
What exactly do they rely on?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
What exactly do they rely on?

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
When do they rely on?

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
These clarifications are necessary.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
And when a person is asked these clarifying questions,

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
he will simply understand that in fact

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
using a specific verb,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
he either really has no information

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
or hides unpleasant facts from himself.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
This project will lead our company forward.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
Where exactly will it lead?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Maybe it will lead forward in the number of bankruptcies.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
A wonderful project.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
Maybe it will lead forward in the number of those

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
who are interested in the tax inspection.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Also a good project.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It will lead forward in the segmentation of the market sector.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
A completely different situation.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Let's clarify.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
How exactly will it lead?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Where? What do you mean?

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
You see, when we talk about the impression that needs to be controlled,

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
it is always related to the fact that we want to clarify,

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
we want to learn the specifics,

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
which are hidden behind any other, non-specific verb.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
They steal in Russia, everyone knows this,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
but nevertheless we live here, lived here and will live here.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
And we will steal too.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
I know what you think.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Very often the statement,

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
when the boss reports to some subordinate,

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
and says, I know what you think, I know what you do.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
How does he know?

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
This is called reading thoughts.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
In fact, it is a very dangerous situation,

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
which we often have to face.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Someone said something,

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
and I formed a certain opinion,

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
according to my perception.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Do you remember what we talked about at the very beginning?

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
And now my first opinion is very difficult to change.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
And accordingly I say, I know what you think,

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
although a person may not have this in his mind at all.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
Many of us have been in such a situation,

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
and here is a rather slippery situation.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Therefore, it may be just a question,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
how do you know this?

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Who told you?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
What are you based on?

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
That is, to try to develop this non-specificity.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
After all, a person perfectly understands,

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
I know what you think.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
List what I think.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
And accordingly, here arises the situation,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
that either we do not understand,

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
or you think quite differently,

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
than I mean.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Very often it happens,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
especially when relationships begin to clear up.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Again, a non-specific verb,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
which can have very serious consequences.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Or I know everything you know.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
In the end.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Well, again, we often meet the statement,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
that the buyers are upset with me.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
What upset you?

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
The fact that they buy little,

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
the fact that they want to pay a lot of money for the product.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
What do they do to upset you?

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
In the end, what did the buyers not please you with?

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
The fact is that if we use common words,

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
if we use common expressions,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
then often there is a situation,

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
that we mean one thing,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
and for ourselves we mean a certain specificity,

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
and a person thinks about something completely different.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
This is what concerns the non-specific verbs.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
Very often, the verb is constantly used in business.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
It, again, has a very important meaning.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
If I do not want to give an exact answer,

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
if I do not want to say something specific,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
if I give a general phrase,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I will think about your proposal,

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
I will brainstorm, we will meet, and so on.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
This, on the one hand, is a way to leave an immediate answer.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
On the other hand,

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
it can be a way of misunderstanding the proposal that is given to you.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
Therefore, in this case, there is a need for clarification

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
about what is being discussed.

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
In addition to the non-specific nouns,

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
in addition to the non-specific verbs,

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
the Russian language, which has a lot of parts of speech,

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
which is a very developed language

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
in terms of the number of different philological elements and turns,

55:27.000 --> 55:33.000
has the so-called modal operator of impossibility and necessity.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
The modal operator is a kind of statement

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
about what can be done, what cannot be done,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
how much it is necessary to do.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
And as for the modal operators,

55:47.000 --> 55:53.000
they are somehow connected with the boundaries of experience

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
that every person has.

55:55.000 --> 56:00.000
Again, let's remember what we said

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
about perception at the beginning of our meeting.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
We are based on the experience that we have.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
And, accordingly, all our views,

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
which in this case occur,

56:17.000 --> 56:23.000
are connected with our knowledge, our experience.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
If our experience is limited,

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
then, accordingly, it is necessary to expand this experience in one way or another,

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
or to clarify what our experience does not coincide with your actions,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
with your approaches.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
That's why modal operators are used,

56:43.000 --> 56:52.000
which are connected with the situation of the possibility to do something.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
When we face such operators as

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
I can't, I must, I have to,

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
then our task is to clarify,

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
to find out for ourselves

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
how limited is the sensory experience that I have,

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
and how I can help my interlocutor, my opponent,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
to go beyond this experience

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
to form the impression he needs for me,

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
so that his impression does not coincide with what I want.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
In this situation, we can go in two ways.

57:38.000 --> 57:45.000
The first way is to clarify the information that our interlocutor has,

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
to understand what needs to be added,

57:48.000 --> 57:55.000
or what negative aspects of this information prevent the interlocutor from making a decision in our favor.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
Or, and this is the simplest way,

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
or the second way is more complicated,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
because it requires art,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
it requires a certain skill,

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
to get access to the information we want.

58:09.000 --> 58:15.000
Naturally, our interlocutor will not tell us what he is afraid of,

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
who he talked to about our company,

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
and what negative impressions he was told.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
This is his information.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
We need to understand what failures occurred in this situation,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
what circumstances occurred.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
Accordingly, we must ask clarifying questions.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Simple.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
What is stopping you?

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
What is making you anxious?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
What is stopping you?

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
What will happen if you do this?

58:45.000 --> 58:50.000
And what will happen if you could not do this?

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
And, in the end, the good old question.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Who told you this?

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
What are you based on?

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Where did you get this information?

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
What is the reason for your doubts?

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Modality,

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
I can't,

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
perfection,

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
duty,

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
it always implies some limitation,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
which is imposed on behavior.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
It can be a limitation of ignorance,

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
it can be a limitation of my negative experience,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
which follows me like a train,

59:22.000 --> 59:29.000
it can be a limitation of the fact that I have some warnings,

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
some attachment to a person, to a company,

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
to the actions that are offered to me.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
And, accordingly, when I ask clarifying questions,

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
when I try to find out what is behind this modality,

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
where are these limiting statements,

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
what does not allow you to form a positive impression about my company,

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
about my offer,

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
about the ideas that I make for you,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
then, accordingly, these clarifications give me an opportunity

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
to perform the necessary actions,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
to change, to clarify the offer that is offered to me.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Well, for example,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
let's take a statement, which, again, can be often encountered,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000
that we cannot refuse to work with the previous provider,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and it is not profitable to work with several.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Again, you make some offer,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
you have already formed a company,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
and very often such an argument can be made.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Then you can ask the following question,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
what exactly is preventing you?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Who said that you cannot work with another provider?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And what will happen if you refuse to work with us?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
What will happen if you refuse to work with the providers

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
who you are working with now?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Are you satisfied with everything?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Has he ever let you down?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
We ask questions and try to find the ground,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
the ground for conversation, the ground for mutual understanding,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
the ground for the conversation to continue,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
because if we are told that we cannot work,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
then the conversation ends on its own.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Now we are trying to find the common points of contact,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
because these points of contact will allow us to further develop the topic,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
to master the metaprograms, to master this or that information,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
to work with specific verbs and statements.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Model operators are used quite often,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:47.000
and in fact they are a reflection of the experience I had,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
the experience I had, the experience I worked with, the experience I am based on.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Our task is to shake up this negative sensory experience

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
that I got through my sensory organs,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
maybe I got some bumps on it,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
but it was, and it was not with me.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Now the situation has changed.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Let's do some actions that will allow you to dispel the difficulties that arise in me.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The question of majority often arises with children, with parents,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
with employees.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
As for HR, it is very often said here,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
you must come to work on time,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
you must work until you do everything.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Who am I supposed to work with? Who said that?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
What will happen if I don't do it?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Very often these problems, these model operators lead to conflicts,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
they form an authoritarian impression

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
that has no effect on the image, brand, reputation of the company.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
You have to work with them,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
because in fact they are very easily shaken up and very easily changed.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But this is not all that can be faced from the point of view of the verbality of the formation of the correct impression.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
The next verbal characteristic that very often contributes to the formation of an inadequate impression

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
is the use of the universal quantitative.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Many, all, never, always, the slogan from the 12th studio.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Universal quantitative is just a quantity that has no clear values.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Accordingly, when we try to clarify,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
we must ask a question about how to concretize the above statement.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Universal quantitative is always a super-comprehension.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
We generalize everything in one way or another.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
In this regard, what can we do?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000
For example, to repeat the same universal quantitative that you gave me in a questionable form.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Well, in the traditional statement, especially for women,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
all men are greedy.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Indeed, here is a very important question.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Indeed, all your husbands are greedy, your boss is greedy.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Every man who was greedy at the beginning of his life, your parents were greedy.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
There is, of course, a certain subtlety,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
because you can get to such an example that confirms once again.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
But again, in this situation, you do not need to touch on significant examples,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
but you need to take something neutral.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000
For example, you cannot remember a single man who was generous.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Santa Claus can always be remembered.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Of course, he is generous, he has his own generosity.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
What exactly are men greedy?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
What do you understand by the greed of a man?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Look, there is a universal quantitative,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
all men with the same success can be called women.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I would like to ask the same question.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
All, all, all, really?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So that a person thinks,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
does it really make sense for him to make this statement now,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
if you say that your boss is a man,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
and you are discussing with him the issue of raising your salary?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Another way is to thicken the paints even more.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
For example, no one knows the drug Propylex.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
No one knows at all.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
If no one knew Propylex, how would he take any other thing on the market?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Who exactly does not know anything about Propylex?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And the same person will think,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
so, will I not expose myself in a bad light,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
if I say that no one knows about it,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
or maybe only I do not know about it?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Another way is to get an exceptional example from the interlocutor.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Again, the examples we talked about were there.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And again, the next thing is to clarify the experience of the interlocutor.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
What is the connection of this statement?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Maybe you have met only such men?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Maybe your experience is limited only by them?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Maybe you have based only on your experience,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
or this experience of someone else?

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The task is to work with universal quantities,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
but I emphasize it again, carefully,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
because it is not worth asking provocative questions here,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
just because maybe the status is not the same.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
You came to negotiations,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
you wanted to learn the contract,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
why should you aggravate the situation?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Translate the conversation into a neutral topic.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
So, as for the universal quantities,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
then, accordingly, all this is a kind of generalization.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
With the help of our sensory senses,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
vision, hearing, kinesthetics,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
we never have a relationship with the universal quantities.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
We have no relationship with the whole world.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
We have a relationship with a specific room where we are,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
with a specific place where we sit.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The next element that prevents the formation of an adequate impression

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
is the use of comparisons.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And very often, comparisons with silence,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
when there is no comparison standard.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
In this situation,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
a certain comparison is simply used,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
but it is omitted, what is compared with.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
For example, things are going well,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
we do not need to sign a contract with you.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
What is it, things are going well?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It is not clear what is being compared with.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Things are going well compared to what?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
To your previous business,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
to your business with other suppliers,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
to the business that occurs in my personal life.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
What am I comparing with?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I need to identify this standard.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Because comparison is pointless.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I always compare certain circumstances that occur to me

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
and strive to deal with these circumstances.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I will get too little profit from your contract.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
What is too little profit?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Let's say,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
too little profit of 1%

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
means an additional profit of 1.5 million dollars.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
1.5 million dollars is not a significant profit for you.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
We work with different numbers.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And accordingly, I do not understand what you are comparing with.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Well, if 1.5 million is not a significant profit for you,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
it is clear.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
But if it is about 1%, what is 1% worth?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
We clarify, and then we already

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
start to get to the specifics of the relative comparison.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And accordingly, 1% is not enough.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Okay, 2%, 3 million dollars.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
This is a sufficient amount.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
We find common figures from which we can start.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
If 1.5 million is not money for you,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
it is money for me.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Let's clarify what you benefit from us and what we benefit from you.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Again, our goal when we work on impressions is to bring the general point of view.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Our profit is higher than you offer.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Higher than what?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Higher than what is your profit and when is it higher?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Now? And what will happen tomorrow?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
How can the profit change if we use one or another contract?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Let's say so.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Or another statement that this company is more generous to dividends than you are.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
More generous to dividends.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
What is it more generous to dividends?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Then what profit does this company promise?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Dividends from what?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
From 1.5 million to 500 thousand.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Again, we are trying to avoid the lack of specifics,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
avoid misunderstanding the situation

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and to move on to the specific figures that we can discuss.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000
This is what concerns the impressions that arise with social perception,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
with social interaction,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
which very often arise during the negotiating processes that we conduct.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Naturally, in this case, the main problem is that we have to verbally clarify what is meant.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It is pointless to give a lot of arguments to dispel all your doubts.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
All doubts will not be dispelled.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
All, in the end, is also a universal quantity.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
But if I know exactly what I want to figure out,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
what you doubt,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
then we can talk specifically.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
And if we talk specifically, then we already speak a specific language,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
and then we can vary the figures,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
vary the agreements.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
We can form an impression that both parties want

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and, accordingly, get the desired data,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
conclude a particular contract.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
This is what concerns the issue of forming impressions,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
what concerns working with language, with clarification,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and with the fulfillment of information lost by generalization,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
exclusion and omission.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact that perception is the initial stage of information processing.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
But this is the stage that determines all subsequent methods of work,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
all subsequent results that we will achieve, that we will receive.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
That is why we have devoted so much time to perception,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and, accordingly, I would like to focus on the most frequent aspects of this perception

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and the formation of the impression that is obtained as a result.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Thank you for your attention.
