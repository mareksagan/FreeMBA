WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I think that it is not a secret for many of us.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
We can be satisfied with those who lead us, or not.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
We can be sure that we would lead better.

00:17.000 --> 00:29.000
But unfortunately, we are in a situation where it is difficult for us to choose a hierarchy of subordination.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
It already exists in the organization.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
And we, entering this organization, are forced to accept this hierarchy.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
However, it can be accepted in different ways.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
It can be accepted harshly, to do only this and not a step to the side.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Or, as for the same hierarchy that exists in the organization, it gives us a certain corridor.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
And in this corridor of possibilities, we can choose what suits us and what does not.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
If we are not satisfied with the corridor of possibilities, then let's look for another company.

01:03.000 --> 01:15.000
But the bigger the corridor that the company gives us, the more a person understands that this company has an opportunity for his individual development.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
And accordingly, he will value his work in this company, because it gives him the opportunity to develop.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
And not only to exploit him to get certain results.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
And accordingly, he will be interested in increasing the output.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
The same applies to the bureaucratic organization of work.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
I think many of us have come across the fact that in order to get a visa on a document,

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
you have to wait until this visa passes the appropriate stage of approval.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Time goes by, opportunities are lost.

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
And very often any of us criticizes this non-turning liberal machine that exists in this organization,

01:55.000 --> 02:04.000
because of which we miss benefits, because of which we miss those or other prerogatives and dividends on the market, and so on.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Unfortunately, here you have to choose a balance.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Any organization is a structure, and structures are impossible without bureaucracy.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
But again, bureaucracy can be different.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
It can be tough, it can be flexible.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
And accordingly, depending on what kind of bureaucratic structure exists in the organization,

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
there are certain opportunities for the existence and implementation of human factors within this organization.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And accordingly, if the system...

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
And the bureaucratic system is not a candidate, it is not a child's play.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
We all live in a state.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Any society is a certain bureaucratic system.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
We have to obey it because we live in this society.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
But if we find a system that does not burden us very much,

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
we will be more interested in staying in this organization, developing in this organization,

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
simply because this organization gives us more opportunities for our development

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
and provides less obstacles for our functioning.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
The next element of the doctrine of human relations, which was proposed by me,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
concerns management.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
The fact is that according to the classical model, there was a strict hierarchy.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
If I am the boss, you must do what I tell you, and I don't care if you like it or not.

03:39.000 --> 03:48.000
We drew attention to the fact that managers should still focus on satisfying the needs of people.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
Yes, the manager's final task is to achieve maximum productivity.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
But if I constantly demonstrate and emphasize this task,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
that I don't care about you as a person, I care about your work,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
and if you have something wrong, I will always find you a replacement,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
well, accordingly, there will be a relationship.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I will not be interested in working in this company.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
I will naturally look for another company where there are some different relations.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
The same thing, that's what I was talking about.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
From the fact that you are the boss, that you have more experience,

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
it is not necessary to take into account the needs of your employees.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
If in the classical model the main attention of the manager is focused on technical factors,

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
such as the performance of the machine, the weight of the machine, the lighting of the machine,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
the number of parts in this machine, the number of blanks,

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
then this factor should still be taken into account.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
What does an employee need to work effectively?

05:00.000 --> 05:09.000
Salary, vacation, additional food, longer breaks for rest.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
That is, any person has certain needs,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
a person can get tired, and he wants to satisfy these needs.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
We work to be able to satisfy the needs we have.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
If the manager will pay attention,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
including to the subjective needs of the person,

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
then the employee who will stop feeling like a slave to the machine

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
will be interested in thanking such a manager.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
This will be manifested in the increase in productivity,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
maximization of profits,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
in the end, he will have more interest in work,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
and therefore he will do less marriage.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
That is, it is necessary...

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Maillot's formula is very simple.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
The manager should not forget that he is in charge of people, not machines.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Now this phrase is obvious, but in the days of Maillot,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
this was the time of the Great Depression, we will remember it,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
that is, the time of the global economic collapse,

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
it was a fundamentally new idea and a fundamentally new approach.

06:24.000 --> 06:33.000
At the same time, Maillot paid attention to the impact of material stimulation.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
As we remember, in the classical model,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
material stimulation played a major role,

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
but Maillot noticed that in this case,

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
individual reward should be supported by group, collective reward.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
That is, if I work well,

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
then, accordingly, the productivity of not only me,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
but also the productivity of the group in which I work increases,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
and, therefore, there should be a support for group behavior.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Here again, the ratio of group and individual.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
At the same time, Maillot paid attention to non-material stimulation.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
We remember that as for Taylor, he just noticed that in addition to material stimulation,

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
there is also a social aspect that plays an important role in human behavior.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
As for Maillot and his doctrine of human relations,

07:38.000 --> 07:48.000
he directly states that material or economic stimuli should be supported by social and psychological.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
It is Maillot who introduces such a term as a favorable moral climate of the collective,

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
or a psychological climate in the collective that exists.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
It is it that emphasizes that the presence of this favorable psychological climate

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
will significantly contribute to the growth of labor productivity.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Remember those girls he experimented with,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
and whom he forced to work almost in the dark,

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
and the productivity of the labor did not fall below the productivity of those girls who worked in normal conditions.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
In addition to the psychological climate, the satisfaction of labor was of great importance.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
Today we know all this from the theory of Herzberg and the theory of motivations,

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
which exist and are used in modern management.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
But all this is based on the experiments conducted by Maillot,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
and which found their reflection in his doctrine of human relations.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Moreover, Maillot drew attention to the fact that

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
the productivity of labor depends on the style of management that exists in the company.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
And the authoritarian style of management will, of course,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
lead to a certain limit to the growth of labor productivity.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
But this will be a phenomenon of working from under the stick.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
As soon as the worker feels that this stick has weakened,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
he will immediately try to get away from work.

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
And Maillot has repeatedly proved this with his experiments.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
If there is another, more democratic style of management,

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
when the worker understands, believes that something depends on his opinion,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
no matter how much it is in fact, the main thing is that the worker believes so.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
This is already a management function,

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
which is discussed and analyzed in the management theory.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Then the worker will be interested in the manifestation of initiative,

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
will be interested in the fact that the results and actions that he performs

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
will help to increase the productivity of labor,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
so that he gets a certificate, gets praise,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
so that he, no matter how it sounds, but Maillot, pays attention to this.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Let's hang it on the board of honor.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
Maillot was one of those who proposed to hang photos of front-line workers.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
So the board of honor also rises to the experiments of Maillot.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
These are, in principle, the main ideas of the doctrine of human relations,

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
the main ideas of the human factor that we proposed.

10:41.000 --> 10:50.000
The Khatun experiment and the whole sphere of discovery of patterns associated with it

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
represented the second stage of the development of the theory of organizational behavior.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
These are the 20s and 40s.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
Accordingly, what concerns this doctrine of human relations,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
here attention was focused on the human as such.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
Don't just think that the following extreme happened here.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
That is, if before, in the classics, they were engaged only in objective production,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
now they spit on production and began to engage in human.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Of course not.

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
As for business, a good, healthy business never throws itself into the extreme.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
Naturally, if a person does not have enough means of production,

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
does not have the necessary equipment, he will not be able to produce something.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
But the same machines can be made more convenient for work.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
For example, a person could not stand on it, bending over,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
but could be in a comfortable position with a normal degree of displacement.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
And accordingly, there was also a focus on the fact that,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
as we said in the same classics,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
the enterprise is the work of a group.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
And accordingly, everything that concerns machines, equipment,

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
it should have been satisfactory for one or another brigade.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
The task was to find out which groups the labor collectives were divided into.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Large groups, small groups, medium groups.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Because now, in addition to these objective characteristics,

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
a very important value has become given to informal relations.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Informal relations that may not even concern work.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
It may be informal relations that after work,

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
we will go together to engage in some cultural events.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
And accordingly, we are interested in doing the work faster,

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
to do it more successfully.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Because if we do it badly,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
a disassembly will begin, where some mistakes have been completed.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Reprocessing may begin,

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
we may be forced to fix a marriage,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
and so there will be less time for communication.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
Again, as for the second stage of the theory of organizational behavior,

13:25.000 --> 13:34.000
more attention was paid to the style of management of the race and the theory of motivation.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Once we introduce a person into production,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
then a person, as a living being, has its own motives,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
its own desires, its own needs,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
and these desires must be satisfied.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
A person works, and this is obvious, not to make the owner rich.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
A person works to find his place in life,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
to achieve any results that he has.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
If work allows him to significantly satisfy his desires,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
his needs, then I will stick to this work.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
If my work only makes me drink juices,

14:10.000 --> 14:19.000
then I will look for another job that, let's say, will see a person in me.

14:19.000 --> 14:28.000
Again, this stage, the second stage of the theory of organization,

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
was associated with the fact that the management system has changed.

14:33.000 --> 14:42.000
The idea of delegating powers has emerged.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Let's recall the classic.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
In the classic, the manager clearly says what, when, where, what to do.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
Now, in the non-classical stage of the doctrine of human relations,

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
more attention has been paid to delegating powers.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay, I have a general picture.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
In this picture, you must do this and that.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
I am delegating powers to you on the issue of releasing the elements you need.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I am taking the initiative.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
But at the end of the day, there should be a certain number of products.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
How will you get them?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I will not control you.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I will not stand behind you to check.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
But I will control the final result.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Thus, a great deal of attention was paid to the satisfaction of the individual,

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
to the formation of his social needs, social stability.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
And perhaps a very important achievement of this second stage

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
was the emergence of non-material stimulation.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
At that time, the terms like

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
interdependent management,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
humanization of labor,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
implementation of certain group decisions,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
education of the employees,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
what is now called training and development of the staff,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
evaluation of motivation,

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
all this takes the lead in these Khatun experiments.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
In the first place, in one way or another,

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
a person is promoted as a necessary element,

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
a necessary link of the functioning of the organization.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
And organizational behavior

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
now becomes not just a behavior of servicing machines,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
it becomes the behavior of living people,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
who in the process of industrial production

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
interact with a particular technique.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
And then the method of optimization of work with the technique is considered.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
How to achieve less fatigue,

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
how to make the right breaks, and so on.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
This whole situation is connected with the second stage of organizational behavior.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
The first stage of organizational behavior

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
was actually the stage before the beginning of the Second World War.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
It should be said that the beginning of the Second World War,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
no matter how strange it may sound,

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
was a significant impact on organizational research.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
And, of course, it was largely connected with military needs.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
What is war?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
War is always the mobilization of a large number of people.

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
Mobilization implies that a large number of non-military people come,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
who need to be taught very quickly

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
to use one or another military technique,

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
to use one or another weapon,

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
and, of course, to teach people to achieve victories,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
to kill them less.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
As for the Second World War,

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
this task arose in millions of people.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
And the task was very simple.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
People came who had little desire to fight.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
They have completely different professions.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
They have families, children, and in the end they all want to live.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
And, of course, this is the main motive

18:47.000 --> 18:58.000
that makes these people master the relevant specialties and military professions as quickly as possible.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
The problem was education.

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
And as for the third stage of organizational behavior,

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
it is connected with the problem of education.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
The military actions that followed the Second World War

19:18.000 --> 19:29.000
were precisely the need to train military non-professionals in military actions.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
It is now that the education structure is beginning to develop.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
And more and more time, more and more attention

19:38.000 --> 19:47.000
is being paid to what was previously called re-training.

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
And this re-training had to be put in pretty tough frames.

19:54.000 --> 20:03.000
It is during this period that a large number of psychological professional tests are being formed,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
which now use the theory of organizational behavior with great pleasure.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
It was necessary to understand the psychological stability of people,

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
their temperament, their character, their scrupulousness, their pedanticism,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
their ability to work in stressful situations.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
To do this, it was necessary to sort out a large number of newcomers who come to you.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
And depending on their psychological properties,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
depending on their personality characteristics,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
that's what we were talking about,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
to distribute them among the ranks of the troops,

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
to determine their type of occupation in a very large structure of military interactions.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
In the first place, in this case, of course, psychology stood out.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
And a huge number of tests, which we use now,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
were created in the 1940s.

21:01.000 --> 21:10.000
Psychological skills tests, professional readiness tests,

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
professional adaptability tests, various differential surveyors,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
they are created at that time.

21:18.000 --> 21:27.000
Organizational behavior researchers realized what a powerful tool they had in their hands.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
The war was over, and, as they say, thank God.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
But now there are a lot of developments,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
the development of scientific material,

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
which can be used, including in peaceful life.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
Moreover, these tests were valid, they were justified,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
they were reliable, reproducible,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
and the main thing is that these tests were conducted on a large number of people.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
That is, these tests were approved, were standardized,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
and now I can apply them.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
This period is characterized by the fact

22:08.000 --> 22:15.000
that psychology begins to penetrate very strongly into organizational behavior.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
Well, of course, from the point of view of logic, everything is fine here.

22:19.000 --> 22:26.000
Mayot introduces human relations into the classic model of Taylor.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Moreover, his human...

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Mayot still went from a psychological point of view,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
but he was engaged in a more social psychology,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
and again, he gave general recommendations,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
that's what we listed.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
And now we need specifics.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
The times of peace have come.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
The period of the restoration of the industrial economy begins again.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
New equipment, new equipment appears.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
The product of double purpose appears.

22:54.000 --> 23:02.000
Many military apparatus and mechanisms begin to be used in peaceful life.

23:02.000 --> 23:09.000
And, accordingly, now you can already identify more specific competencies,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
more specific abilities of people who are needed.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
What qualities should the dispatcher of civil aviation have?

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
What qualities should the dispatcher of numerical program management machines have,

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
which also arise at about this time?

23:26.000 --> 23:34.000
What qualities should a person have in order to be able to work with a large amount of information?

23:34.000 --> 23:45.000
How to ensure and achieve that a person is able to concentrate and switch attention from one detail to another,

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
from one aspect of the functioning of the machine to another?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
After all, the technique becomes more complicated, a computational technique arises,

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
more and more complex equipment appears, where the price of error is already great.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
If the cost of the machine increases at once,

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
then, accordingly, if it breaks, the price of error increases.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
At the same time, another problem arises.

24:06.000 --> 24:14.000
If before, it was quite easy to train a worker to work with a machine,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
it did not take much time, the machines were simple,

24:17.000 --> 24:27.000
now the technique presents to people, to the service staff, more and more strict requirements.

24:27.000 --> 24:35.000
The demand for education increases, the demand for retraining of people increases.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
You could work on one machine, they had one requirement.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Now the machines have been replaced, not you went to another job.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
Due to the fact that new equipment is beginning to appear faster and faster,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
the machines change every 3-5 years.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Accordingly, if this machine comes to the same factory,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
then why do you need to fire a person who already worked on an old machine?

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
The old machine exhausted itself, and you removed it from the factory.

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
Now you need to train a new worker to work on the previous machines.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
How to achieve processes? How to optimize this process?

25:17.000 --> 25:29.000
As for the post-war period, this stage was significantly related to the problems of training and development of the staff,

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
with the widespread implementation of testing of the staff,

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
and the ability to switch people's needs to new tasks.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
The tasks are gradually beginning to change.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Not yet very quickly, but they are beginning to change.

25:46.000 --> 25:55.000
Accordingly, the requirements that are presented to you as a worker at the factory are changing.

25:55.000 --> 26:04.000
At the same time, the problem of assessing the staff begins to form again.

26:04.000 --> 26:12.000
What is the role of the staff in the development of the factory?

26:12.000 --> 26:23.000
If we look at the development of the theory of organizational behavior in the post-war period,

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
this stage continues even now.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
The main tasks were laid down back then.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
I repeat, this is training and development of the staff,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
assessment and motivation of the staff.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
The fact that now human resources are included in the management area.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
But the structure of the organization itself has changed.

26:48.000 --> 26:57.000
Indeed, let's summarize what is understood today under the organization.

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
Because when we talk about organizational behavior, it naturally revolves around one or another organization.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
There are a lot of models.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
Again, let's not get into different nuances, this is a separate topic.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
But the main thing in an organization, looking at this slide,

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
is that any organization naturally consists of specific people.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
These are the individuals who make up its core.

27:30.000 --> 27:38.000
Modern organizations are such that people do not work alone, they always work in groups.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
And each group is responsible for something of their own.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
There is a finance department, an accounting department,

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
an agreement making department, an administrative department,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
an HR department, and so on.

27:51.000 --> 27:58.000
That is, there are specific functional groups that need to be done.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
Therefore, individuals are grouped into groups that solve one or another functional task.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
And from these functional groups, an organization is formed as such.

28:10.000 --> 28:16.000
Of course, groups and tasks of IT organizations are the same as those of production organizations.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
An organization that provides services has its own structure and tasks.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
But as for organizations, they also do not exist in a vacuum.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
All organizations exist in a certain external environment, in a certain society.

28:30.000 --> 28:36.000
Other organizations, state institutions, controlling bodies, tax authorities, and so on.

28:36.000 --> 28:44.000
And, accordingly, all these four spheres, they concern any organization.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Therefore, all people included in the organization,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
are included in addition to the group that is in the organization,

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
and as part of the organization, they are included in the external social structure.

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
This is a very important element, because it makes no sense to argue and talk about an organization as such.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
There are no autonomous organizations,

29:05.000 --> 29:13.000
because all organizations are always in direct interaction and contact with other people.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
No organization can never produce everything it needs.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
After all, its production is the production for other organizations.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Otherwise, it will simply lose the meaning of business.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
Why is this organization model important to us?

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
It is important to us because it highlights four main elements that each organization has.

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
And accordingly, organizational behavior, if it is interested in describing reality,

29:43.000 --> 29:50.000
if it is an abstract discipline, it should take into account the behavior of all these four elements.

29:50.000 --> 29:58.000
And, of course, if we consider the modern theory of organizational behavior,

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
then it can be described in the following way, which we see on this slide.

30:05.000 --> 30:14.000
In each organization there is a certain hierarchy, which we have already discussed.

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
Today, it has become customary to talk not so much about the hierarchy of subordination,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
but about the hierarchy of leadership.

30:22.000 --> 30:30.000
Every organization has some leading positions, leading representatives.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
Depending on how well you cope with your position,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
depending on what authority you use,

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
there is an authority of either a position or a personality.

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
The authority of the position is assigned to you by the boss, so everyone must obey you.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
Let's recall the classic, it's Taylor-Foyle.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Regardless of your level of competence.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
And yet, at the current stage of the organization's development,

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
this leadership is replaced by the leadership of a personality.

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
Yes, indeed, a person is a leader, but he has certain personal qualities

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
that allow you to really be a leader and use authority.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
If you use authority, then, accordingly, you give someone else's command.

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
If an employee does not understand something, but he knows that you are competent in your field,

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
then, of course, he will do as he is told in order to gain experience

31:38.000 --> 31:46.000
and then understand what the meaning was, what were the functions and tasks of the instruction he received.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
In the end, a leader keeps in front of him the whole picture,

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
which a line leader or even a middle-level leader does not have.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
In this regard, leadership is closely related to learning.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
It is no wonder that we said that one of the very important aspects of organizational behavior in the post-war period,

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
and in our time, is the organization of learning, development, assessment and motivation.

32:14.000 --> 32:23.000
If we are in a company, and if we came to this company not only to get a salary and then go somewhere,

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
if we link our career growth, our career development with this company,

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
we learn, we learn the necessary competencies, we learn the necessary relationships.

32:37.000 --> 32:49.000
After all, very often we learn something by observing people, interaction of people, interaction of leaders,

32:49.000 --> 32:56.000
we try to imitate them, we try to be like those leaders who we like,

32:56.000 --> 33:03.000
and, accordingly, adopt their behavior styles, styles of reaction, styles of solving problems,

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
their communication, their perception, their level of interaction.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
In addition, as we said, any organization is a group of people,

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
therefore, a group dynamics becomes very important.

33:19.000 --> 33:32.000
Very often my success in the organization depends on the relations I have with the employees I interact with.

33:32.000 --> 33:40.000
If I have good cooperative relations, then I can always count on being told what to do,

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
I will be protected from possible mistakes that I can make, I will be helped.

33:46.000 --> 33:56.000
If there are relations of competition, and, accordingly, everyone strives to achieve results at the expense of another,

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
then internal conflicts, internal conflicts, negative internal relations arise,

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
which, of course, leads to what is called a terrarium of like-minded people.

34:07.000 --> 34:15.000
We have little desire to be in such an organization, and no matter how interesting this organization is,

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
no matter how interesting it is, I work with living people.

34:21.000 --> 34:31.000
And if this psychological atmosphere is unbearable for me, I will still look for another organization, no matter how interesting it is.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
Again, when we talk about organizational behavior,

34:37.000 --> 34:46.000
it is important to understand what kind of attitudes people have when they join this organization,

34:46.000 --> 34:57.000
what kind of relations people build, what they want to achieve, what their goals are, what their motivation level is,

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
how the motivation level is set, how the level of achievement is achieved, how the level of compulsion is achieved,

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
whether there is ambition, how ambitious my behavior can be.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
If I come out with different initiatives, how will they evaluate me?

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
Will these initiatives be accepted or rejected?

35:19.000 --> 35:28.000
Will I get encouragement, or, on the contrary, will I be considered a jump and I will be in a social vacuum?

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
How is the decision-making in this organization carried out?

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
As for the management style, does it depend on me?

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
Either I received a clear order that is no longer subject to change, not subject to discussion,

35:45.000 --> 35:56.000
or I get a decision that I can discuss and make changes to.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Again, it is psychology.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Who is a good manager?

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
It is the person in whose office you come in with your opinion, and you come out with the opinion of the manager.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
Moreover, you come out not because you were ordered, but because the manager really justified his position.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
This is a very important situation for decision-making, because it is a person's attitude that reigns in the organization.

36:19.000 --> 36:26.000
If you know that your initiative will be welcomed, that you will not be put on the spot,

36:26.000 --> 36:36.000
and, accordingly, some of your proposals will be accepted and it will be emphasized that you took part in it,

36:36.000 --> 36:44.000
then purely human qualities of such an organization, which exists with such an organization,

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
will be more acceptable to you and you will be pleased to go to work, you will not be afraid to make a mistake,

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
simply because only the one who does nothing makes mistakes.

36:55.000 --> 37:06.000
All decisions are made in a normal working environment, and decisions are justified, proven, and agreed upon.

37:07.000 --> 37:15.000
Any organization today, as in any human behavior, is always associated with stress.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
There are plans that need to be fulfilled, there are tasks that need to be solved,

37:20.000 --> 37:27.000
and 24 hours a day, and only 8 hours of working time, and we must, accordingly, have time to work,

37:27.000 --> 37:35.000
and, remember, we talked about this, work is no more than a third of life, we must still have time to live our own life.

37:35.000 --> 37:42.000
Therefore, organizational behavior is directly associated with stress.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
We make mistakes, we fail, we succeed, we fail.

37:48.000 --> 37:56.000
Nevertheless, no one takes away from me the responsibility to implement and perform certain functions.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
And a person is constantly in stress.

37:59.000 --> 38:09.000
In principle, a low level of stress is a perfectly normal situation associated with human activity.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Stress is always what arises in the condition of a lack of information.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
When we work, we always have a certain lack of information.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
We do not know what order will come today.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
We do not know what assessment will be received by the actions we have taken.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
And in this regard, work is always stress.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
But this stress can keep us in tune and give us an opportunity for career growth, for further development,

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
or it can be the stress that leads to our complete destabilization,

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
to complete lack of understanding, inability to find your place in this work,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
leads to diseases, and so on.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
Accordingly, stress should be optimal.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
This is also very important from the point of view of organizational behavior.

38:58.000 --> 39:06.000
Where are those boundaries that lead to the optimal functioning of a person?

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
Any organization is always a conflict.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
Each person has his own desires, has his own tasks.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
And everyone wants to fulfill certain tasks.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
At the same time, the number of resources we have is limited.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
In the end, we need to get to the boss's reception.

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
The sooner we get to him, the sooner we can start to fulfill the task that is before us.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Again, disputes may arise.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Who will come to the first boss?

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
Who took the turn?

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
Who found one or another way to approach the boss?

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
A conflict is a perfectly normal situation.

39:49.000 --> 39:58.000
Because a conflict always arises in the conditions of the limitation of the resources we have.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Organization is always a limitation of resources.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
At least a resource of time.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
We can be overwhelmed with more and more tasks,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
and we do not have time to fulfill them.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
And we do not fulfill them because we do not want to, we do not know how to, we cannot,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
or because we simply did not have enough time.

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
We try to decide when to do a task.

40:22.000 --> 40:29.000
And, of course, an unfulfilled task leads to a conflict with the person for whom we had to fulfill it.

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
When we are in communication, when we are in an organization, when we are with people,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
the communication aspect is very important.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
How do we interact?

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
How can we and how quickly can we get the information we need?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Is it desirable to be given this information?

40:47.000 --> 40:56.000
Or do we consciously not get anything in order to say later that we did not fulfill a task

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
that shows my incompetence?

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Again, it is pointless to highlight some aspect here.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
All these aspects are interconnected.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
They are all tied to each other.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
And, accordingly, the communication that exists in an organization

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
is directly connected with the psychological climate that exists in it.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Again, how are teams implemented?

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
How is the delegation of powers carried out?

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Or is this delegation not carried out?

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
How is the delegation of responsibility carried out?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Do I only answer for my part,

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
or am I responsible for the success of the implementation of the entire group in which I am?

41:39.000 --> 41:46.000
And how much responsibility will I bear for the non-fulfillment and non-fulfillment of certain functions?

41:46.000 --> 41:54.000
And, again, if we talked about the fact that any organization is immersed in the external environment,

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
then the problem area of organizational behavior is the power and politics

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
among which the organization is implemented.

42:03.000 --> 42:10.000
Indeed, if there is assistance in the development of small, medium, large businesses,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
this is one thing.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
If there is a counteraction, if one or another social opinion, social attitude

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
negatively evaluates the work in business, work in business structures, this is another thing.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
We all live, as I have already said, among other people.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
And therefore, it is important for us not only those relationships, or not only that opinion,

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
not only those assessments that I am given within the organization where I am,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
but also assessments of other people who are significant to me,

42:37.000 --> 42:49.000
assessments of relatives, assessments of people who use a particular authority for me.

42:49.000 --> 42:56.000
This is exactly the area that covers the external sphere of the organization's activities.

42:56.000 --> 43:03.000
Again, as we can see, the field of modern organizational behavior is quite broad and extensive,

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
and it concerns all aspects of human organization's activities.

43:08.000 --> 43:18.000
Therefore, today we can say that a new paradigm of organizational behavior is being formed.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Or rather, it has already been formed.

43:20.000 --> 43:27.000
If we had a classic paradigm of Taylor-Fayol, a paradigm of human relations,

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
the paradigm of human relations of Myo,

43:30.000 --> 43:36.000
then today there is a new paradigm of organizational behavior,

43:36.000 --> 43:46.000
which takes into account all the changes that have taken place in organizations,

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
in the social structure, in the world.

43:49.000 --> 43:58.000
As for these changes, it is worth noting that the modern organization

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
gradually moves away from rigid hierarchical structures

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
and gradually moves to network or matrix structures.

44:08.000 --> 44:14.000
When a working group is created to solve a particular task,

44:14.000 --> 44:23.000
or certain connections and interactions between different departments of the organization

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
to solve a particular task,

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
and this is a temporary group that is created to solve the task that is now being solved.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
After this task is solved, the group will disintegrate,

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
and we will create a new group, and so on.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
This does not mean that we will lose our work.

44:39.000 --> 44:49.000
It just means that the pre-determination that existed in the 80s of the last century has now disappeared.

44:49.000 --> 44:55.000
Now, if we want to meet the standards that the market presents to us,

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
we must be able to react quickly to certain external tasks.

45:01.000 --> 45:15.000
The next point is related to the fact that now the knowledge carriers are gaining more and more importance.

45:15.000 --> 45:21.000
If a person had studied something before and could work at this machine all his life,

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
or had studied a little, but still performed the same types of activities,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
now the situation has changed.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
A modern workplace, a modern organization,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
determines more and more requirements for its employees.

45:33.000 --> 45:41.000
They must be able to respond to the changes that are presented,

45:41.000 --> 45:50.000
and, accordingly, be able to react to all new innovations.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
Today, on average, once every five years,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
it is necessary to increase the level of qualification.

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
Today, more and more people are studying for the MBA.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
You yourself spend your time to acquire new knowledge

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
that will allow you to be more successful in your management activities, in your business.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
The next important change that has taken place in modern organizations

46:20.000 --> 46:27.000
is that if before, the main thing was the vertical division of labor

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
from the hierarchy of subordinates, the boss, subordinate, and so on,

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
now the horizontal division of labor is becoming more and more important.

46:35.000 --> 46:43.000
These network structures, these models of the matrix organization

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
that exist now, are provided by the horizontal division of labor.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
Those or other groups are more successful in solving one or another problem.

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
Therefore, the time of other groups should be spent on solving other problems,

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
which, in general, will contribute to the solution of the problems that are in front of the organization.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
And this does not mean that you are worse at something or that you are doing something.

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
Or that group is more elite or it uses more authority and respect of the management.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
No, it's just that to solve these problems,

47:17.000 --> 47:26.000
competencies of the races and informal relationships that exist in this group are more successful than in another.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
This does not mean that your group is worse.

47:28.000 --> 47:35.000
This means that other problems will arise that will be more successfully solved by your group.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
The horizontal division of labor is now becoming more and more important,

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
which is due to the emergence of new forms of business, virtual business organizations, IT organizations.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
And we'll talk about it a little later.

47:47.000 --> 47:59.000
It should be noted that in modern organizations, as has already been said, the content itself changes.

48:00.000 --> 48:07.000
Now, in order to be a successful businessman, constant training is necessary.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
This feedback is necessary.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
The requirements for the organization are increasing.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
The approaches that are given are constantly changing.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
And if you want to move forward with time, if you want to be successful,

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
if you don't want to give your competitors the opportunity to outrun you, you have to learn.

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
Moreover, this training should not be considered as if I don't know something or I'm stupider than someone.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
Knowledge is produced very quickly now.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
Work constantly receives new content, new content.

48:38.000 --> 48:47.000
If before the new amount of knowledge was obtained somewhere in a century,

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
now, every decade, the amount of knowledge increases almost double.

48:53.000 --> 49:01.000
Moreover, now there is a tendency to reduce this time by doubling the amount of knowledge.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
This became particularly noticeable at the end of the 20th century,

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
just at the time when we are living now.

49:09.000 --> 49:15.000
Because now there is a geometric growth of all new knowledge.

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
And therefore, all the knowledge that we received at the institute is correct,

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
this is good knowledge.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
But this is the knowledge that we received 10, 15, 20 years ago.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Today, new additions, new changes have occurred.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Why do we come to the same MBA course?

49:32.000 --> 49:39.000
After all, in fact, we consider what Taylor, Fayol considered.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
But on the other hand, this is the necessary base that we should know in the first place

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
in order to be able to perceive new changes later.

49:48.000 --> 49:54.000
After all, look, the very same theory of organizational behavior has changed in almost 100 years.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
And what Taylor worked with is not what we work with today.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
Although, on the other hand, in order to understand modern trends,

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
modern needs, modern opportunities,

50:06.000 --> 50:13.000
we need to know the ideas of Taylor, Fayol, Mayer, Liesbegger.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
Simply because they are all in demand today.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Just in different volumes.

50:20.000 --> 50:28.000
In addition, it should be noted that if before, in the first half of the 20th century,

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
there was a great importance of physical labor,

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
then at the end of the 20th century and in our time, in the 21st century,

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
more and more intellectual activities are growing.

50:40.000 --> 50:52.000
Indeed, if now no more than 5% of the US agricultural population feeds almost the entire world,

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
and gradually the population is moving to cities,

50:55.000 --> 51:04.000
then this indicates that the order of intellectual activities is growing more and more.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
If we want to deal with the IT sphere,

51:08.000 --> 51:15.000
if we want to deal with the management, management, organization, telecommunications,

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
then a large amount of knowledge is required here,

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
which is necessary in order to simply use the equipment that surrounds us.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
At the same time, the number of routine work is decreasing.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
It should decrease, let's say, gently.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Well, in the West, it naturally decreases.

51:34.000 --> 51:42.000
If before it was clear that the volume that we had to do,

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
print on a machine, calculate,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
now, with the help of computers,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
which took months and years,

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
it takes hours and minutes.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
Naturally, working time is freed up

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
so that a person can accept his intellectual qualities,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
his intellectual achievements,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
so that a person can solve those or other tasks

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
that are before him as before the worker of the organization,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
who must get a certain result at the end.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
And finally, if we analyze the existing business,

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
we can note that now there has been a shift

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
from the production of products to the provision of services.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
As for production,

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
it is already given to a significant extent,

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
automated.

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
And now, if you look at different types of production companies,

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
they have a huge number of automation,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
a huge number of computers.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
And as for a person,

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
a person already performs the function of controlling the activity of machines.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
That is, the very control where, perhaps,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
those classical ideas are applicable,

52:55.000 --> 53:01.000
as Taylor said at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Only now there is no longer any resentment,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
because a person controls the functioning of a machine.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
And it depends on how he controls it,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
how the program will be written,

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
when the failure that occurs in the program will be noticed in time.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
From here, the functioning of the entire production,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
the entire enterprise, the entire factory depends on a significant extent.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
All of us, after all, know what one small mistake of one aviation dispatcher

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
can lead to.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
After all, although this is no longer production,

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
but nevertheless, this is a typical function of modern production.

53:40.000 --> 53:45.000
At present, with the development of the industry,

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
a person has more and more opportunities to satisfy his needs,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
and the service industry is developing.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
Accordingly, the service industry requires new approaches, new tasks,

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
which are significantly different from everything that was typical for the 20th century.

54:04.000 --> 54:11.000
And this is due to the emergence of new tendencies in organizational behavior.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
At present, to solve this entire complex of tasks,

54:17.000 --> 54:24.000
it is necessary to significantly change the approaches that have traditionally developed in business

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
and which have been reorganized in the industry.

54:27.000 --> 54:34.000
Today we can say that in a significant way the future belongs to those organizations

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
that have such an important quality as self-education.

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
Senge has introduced a special term for self-educating organizations.

54:45.000 --> 54:56.000
The task here is that only if the organization is able to react quickly

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
to the changes that are taking place,

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
it has the opportunity to gain an advantage in the competitive struggle in the modern market.

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
If the organization is striving to rest on the laurels already achieved,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
it will be quickly bypassed,

55:11.000 --> 55:19.000
and this organization will quickly become one of the leaders in the market.

55:19.000 --> 55:26.000
We can see a large number of examples of this in our everyday activities.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
Let's take, for example, the photo carriers.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
Previously, we used to shoot on photo films,

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
and there was a whole industry of printing on these photo films.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
Today we are increasingly switching to electronic carriers,

55:42.000 --> 55:51.000
and now it is even difficult to find a place where you can be shown on photo films.

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
Now there are different methods and approaches to printing.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
These results have occurred in less than 15 years.

56:01.000 --> 56:09.000
These are very short periods for the industries and the industrial structures that exist.

56:09.000 --> 56:18.000
In this regard, it is important to note that the theory of organizational behavior

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
today has the task of requiring a rapid response to the constant change in the market,

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
to the constant innovation, to various risky events.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
This is largely due to the emergence of venture companies,

56:36.000 --> 56:44.000
when it is not known what result will be achieved by one or another idea.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
But we invest in them.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Will these funds be repaid?

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
They can be repaid in installments, they can not be repaid.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
This is why there is a need for multi-profile companies

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
that cover different sectors of the market.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
Thanks to those sectors that are in demand now,

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
we can invest funds in applied research,

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
in the release of some new products that can conquer the market,

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
or maybe not conquer the market.

57:16.000 --> 57:26.000
These are all the needs and tasks that the theory of organizational behavior is designed to solve.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
What are the applications of the theory of organizational behavior?

57:34.000 --> 57:49.000
The next question we will consider is the application of the theory of organizational behavior.

57:49.000 --> 57:57.000
The fact is that we can talk about different concepts, different tasks,

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
but this will be interesting for the scientific approach.

58:01.000 --> 58:08.000
If we talk about business, that is, about the situation when I invest funds and I have to get a return,

58:08.000 --> 58:13.000
then business is a very specific area.

58:13.000 --> 58:21.000
And, let's say, general theoretical approaches are not in the report.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
And if the theory of organizational behavior claims to be pragmatic,

58:26.000 --> 58:32.000
to meet the realities and requirements of the modern market,

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
it must solve specific tasks that are in front of it.

58:37.000 --> 58:44.000
We will now talk about the whole set of these tasks.

58:44.000 --> 58:51.000
So, based on the tasks of the theory of organizational behavior that we talked about,

58:51.000 --> 58:58.000
what problems are most relevant for specialists?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
What problems do they solve?

59:00.000 --> 59:08.000
And why is the theory of organizational behavior so important for the activities of one or another organization today

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
that its study and analysis is given a lot of attention?

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
I would just like to highlight the main areas that exist today.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
It does not mean that there are only these areas.

59:19.000 --> 59:27.000
These approaches are the most significant in terms of the needs of modern business.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
Let's look at this slide.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
So, the first task that is usually solved.

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
Again, I want to say that the order in which it is listed is not important here.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
The tasks themselves are important, which we will talk about.

59:45.000 --> 59:50.000
Because for each organization, one or another approach is important,

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
because everywhere there are weak points, weak places.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
So, we usually start with selecting employees and distributing them to work.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
A person comes to work in an organization.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
This organization already exists.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Some principles have already developed in this organization, some points.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It has its own ethics, its own corporate culture.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
If this is a giving organization, then a person comes to work.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Therefore, this organization is created for some goals, for some tasks.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And it is created in the way that its owner has.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000
As for this selection, it is natural that it is necessary to develop assessment tools.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
The assessment tools of an employee are needed in order to assess his ability,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
assess his competence, conduct his attestation and, accordingly,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
make a certain career trajectory.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
How can an employee advance further in this organization?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
What are his career prospects?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
What are his career tasks?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
What goals can he have in this organization?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
In addition to the fact that, of course, he performs the functionality that is assigned to him,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
according to the vacancy that he occupies.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:21.000
In addition, the theory of organizational behavior should take care of the validity of the tools

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
that are used to solve these tasks.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
A large number of tests have been developed today, which we have already talked about.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
But these tests, which were developed during and after the Second World War,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
were characterized by the fact that they were tested on a huge number of people.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Millions of people took these tests.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Modern tests are developed, unfortunately, very quickly,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and the issue of their adaptation is not paid enough attention.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000
In this regard, there is a problem of how valid these tests are.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Unfortunately, very often, a lot of attention is paid to these tests,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:09.000
and it is believed that these tests allow a person to get all the information that he hides

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
or that he does not want to demonstrate.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And, of course, if we choose from such parcels,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
then we will have our own attitude to the results that we receive.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000
In order not to make a mistake, in order not to miss a really necessary person

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
who will be useful in our work, it is necessary to ask the question of validity.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
No matter how understandable, pleasant and obvious the test is,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
the main task is not in this, but in the fact that it is really valid,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
that it is reliable and that it is tested on a large number of people,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000
that it really solves the tasks that have been created and meets the requirements that are presented to it.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
The next task that is solved in the same area is the professional analysis.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
A person comes with certain knowledge and corresponds to a certain profession.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
He can correspond to it successfully, he can correspond to it unsuccessfully.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
He may require additional knowledge, and therefore the question arises

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000
whether we should pre-educate a person, or we should re-educate him,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
or a person can correspond to another professional area,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
whether in our organization or not.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:38.000
But here it is necessary to conduct an analysis of how much a person meets the professional requirements

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
that are presented to him at his new workplace.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
At the same time, the development and application of the personnel selection program

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
becomes of great importance in this respect.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
In large modern companies, they have long moved away from the situation

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
that they take a person from the street and then try to teach him.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Now the company is interested in hiring experts,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
in this regard, there are various kinds of contracts with universities,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
corporate universities are being created, business centers are being created,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
corporate educational centers are being created,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
which solve the task of assigning the employee the necessary knowledge,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
training and development of the necessary competencies,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
which will be useful for solving the tasks that will be presented to him.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000
At the same time, the task of optimizing the placement of the personnel becomes of great importance.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
We have already talked about the fact that modern organizations are not a rigid structure

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
that will exist for decades.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Modern organizations, whether they are theoretical or matric,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
very often create working groups to solve a particular task.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
They are called in different ways, working group, project group,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
design group, development group, temporary group.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
This is a group of employees, a group of departments,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
which are created specifically to solve a particular task.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Very often, people are selected for the solution of a particular task.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And then the task arises, the question arises, here the task is solved.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
How optimal are these employees for working in this organization?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Should they be fired or should they be transferred to another field of activity?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
How will they be able to solve certain tasks?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
This is a problem of optimization.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
We have already invested funds in these specialists.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
We have already provided them with work and training.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Therefore, now the task arises for these employees to be optimal

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
in terms of the tasks that are created by the organization.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Pay attention, it is the organization, because the organization has a priority

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
in the face of the needs and needs of the employees.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
At the same time, it is necessary to solve the task of forming a personnel reserve.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000
The fact is that if an employee has worked in an organization for a long time,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
he already knows its corporate culture, its tasks.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000
He already knows and accepts the psychological climate,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
the psychological norms, the psychological background that arises in him.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000
In this regard, the problem arises that the promotion of this employee

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
becomes a bearer of corporate standards.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
He has gone from a manager to a senior manager,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and now he can already be a manager.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Now he is in a state of training, guidance, assessment,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and the formation of work for the new employees.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
These are the so-called bearers of organizational experience,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
and this experience is very expensive.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000
This is the area of tasks that is solved in terms of selecting employees

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and their distribution to work in terms of organizational behavior theory.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
The next area is very important, which we have already mentioned several times today.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
It is training and development of the staff.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Indeed, tasks are constantly changing, requirements are constantly changing,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
innovations are entering our lives.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Therefore, we, having employees who occupy their workplaces,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
must pay attention to their development and training.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But this is, of course, investment.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Moreover, investment is not small.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
If we look at the modern educational service market,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
there are a large number of providers that offer different trainings,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
different training programs.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
They are of different cost, they have different prices,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
but at the same time they have different reputations.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Therefore, the problem arises with which providers the contracts are concluded,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
with which providers to communicate reliably.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Therefore, it is necessary to determine, first of all, the need for development.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Again, we should not put out the current fire.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
If it suddenly became clear to us that we do not have enough specialists with the necessary knowledge,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
then it is pointless to solve the problem right now.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
This problem could have been foreseen,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
because it was possible to send employees to improve their qualifications in advance,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
without interruption from production, in a certain order,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000
so that when new tasks arise, we already have trained employees.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Business always works on foreseeing the situation.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
If you can foresee it successfully, you can successfully get dividends, results,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.000
bypass competitors and take the leading positions in the niche that is relevant today.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Therefore, to determine the need for training is not an easy task,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
which is done by specialists in the theory of organizational behavior,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
because, again, the task is risky.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
After all, such specialists may be needed, and they may not be needed.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Again, we need analytics, again, we need deep knowledge and analysis of the market in which we function.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
After we have determined the need for training,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
it is necessary to compose, approve and agree on the training program.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Providers have typical training programs.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
We work in a specific company, in a specific organization,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and therefore it is very important for us to reflect the specific goals, tasks, and needs of our organization.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
We do not need to know the theory of sales at all.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Open the textbook and read.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000
We are interested in the theory of sales of IT equipment, if we work in the corresponding company.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000
We are interested in the sales of software, if we work in the corresponding company.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
We are interested in the sales of cars, if we work in a car company, and so on.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Any training should be specific.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And it is for specific training that we must pay.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
But here again it is necessary to take into account that in addition to the substantive training,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
it is also necessary to develop management skills, managerial skills.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Because these are the skills that are associated with the successful construction of the hierarchy of our organization,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000
with the successful distribution of authority and responsibilities, with the ability to manage.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
A competent management is a huge need and a huge need for successful business functioning.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000
After the needs are determined, the programs are agreed and approved,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
it is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the training.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
This is a very important task.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Because, indeed, you can send employees to study, you can invest in this means, but the question arises,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:48.000
how effective is the training that is happening for this organization?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So that the training does not turn into training for the sake of training.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
In business, it is still important to solve the tasks that are in front of the organization.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And in this regard, it is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the invested funds and the result.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
If we invest funds, but the result is not there, then it makes you think,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
whether we are teaching them, whether we are teaching them, and whether we are teaching them.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And just all those tasks that specialists in the theory of organization should analyze and solve.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Of course, in a significant way, these tasks are solved by HR specialists.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000
But we have already talked about the fact that the HR field and the theory of organization are very closely intertwined.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Maybe closer than other disciplines, which we talked about at the very beginning.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:43.000
If we train an employee, then we are interested in the fact that he worked in our company.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.000
If we invest funds in him, we are interested in the fact that the training that is taking place will benefit the company.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And therefore, we should be interested in the planning of the career of this employee in our organization.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000
If we train an employee, if he is successful, if he grows with the company,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
then we can think about the career growth of this employee.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Maybe he will become a new manager, a new leader.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
After all, the most valuable are those leaders who have passed the whole stage and the entire hierarchy,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
starting from the ground and ending at the highest level.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.000
They know many underwater stones, they know all the difficulties that arise, they know where and what to pay attention to.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Therefore, planning a career is a very significant aspect of the theory of organization.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.000
If an employee knows that his career is planned, he will be interested in working in this particular company.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Because here he not only receives money, but also carries out personal development and professional growth.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:14:01.000
The next aspect, which is also important in organizational behavior, is organizational development.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
We have already discussed that modern organizations are very mobile.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.000
In principle, if today the organization is static, it is doomed.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
To a large extent, this is due to the state sector.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The state sector is very well bureaucratized, but that is why it often does not keep up with the realities that are happening.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:38.000
It is here that different business organizations have a significant advantage in terms of the functioning of their actions in the commercial sector.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:46.000
But in order to plan organizational development, it is necessary to analyze the structure of the organization.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Maybe the structure of the organization was very successful a year, two, three, five years ago,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000
when the organization was being created, when it actively pushed its market share and when it received the desired results.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
But time has changed, and the structure remains the same.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:16.000
If we take the long-term existence of the organization, we can see that the structural units are changing with great difficulty.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It is very difficult to reduce the existing ones, and even more difficult to create new ones.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:36.000
This is often a problem related to large organizations, because they have a branched structure that has already recommended itself.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
People are already working there.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Accordingly, if we make a reorganization or reduction, then very often we cut people alive, and the problem arises as to how optimal and useful it is.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Before taking any action, it is necessary to analyze the structure of the organization, how it meets modern needs,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000
how much it admires the tasks that may arise in the near future,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
based on the fact that business is constantly changing and new roles and tasks are emerging.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:19.000
The next question, which is related to organizational development, is how to increase the satisfaction of employees with work,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.000
and at the same time, this must be done in order to increase the effectiveness of their work.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:33.000
We have already discussed that if a person works for a long time, and this work leads to routine activities,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
he loses interest, he loses attention, and a person becomes interested in further development,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
further developing his career, further developing his personal growth.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Can this be done in the same organization? It can be done in another.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:55.000
So, organizational development is about providing a person who has already gained experience in this organization

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
with an opportunity to further develop within the framework of the same organization.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000
After the analysis of the structure of the organization is made,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
the assumption is made about the increase in the satisfaction and effectiveness of work,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:21.000
the most difficult stage is coming, perhaps, the implementation of the organizational changes themselves.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Because here, if we make these changes, then we take responsibility for the structure and functioning of a successful organization,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and for the fate of those people who work in this organization and whom we change,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
because we make some changes.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Changes are always perceived by a person in a painful way.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
There is something that I am already used to, and I know what I can learn from it.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And little or nothing will happen now.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And these are the restrictions that are being imposed.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Maybe this is an attempt to get rid of me, to reduce me, to fire me, and so on.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Organizational development is a very significant layer of organizational behavior,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.000
because development is usually faced with a counteraction to this development.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
How to make it the most painless?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:17.000
How to help this organizational change and further contribute to the effectiveness of the organization,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000
contribute to the development of organizational behavior in a progressive direction,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
but not from the point of view of sabotage or regression.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:38.000
The next big direction that can be highlighted in organizational behavior is the measurement of the work.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Business is always a matter of calculation, a matter of quantity.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And we always know how much we produce, what we produce, how we produce.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:58.000
We plan, and planning is an important element, the number of staff to produce certain products,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
to provide certain services, to cover the entire market sector.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:12.000
In this regard, before performing certain results, before performing organizational measurements,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
before performing organizational development, before performing training, selection of employees,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:26.000
it is necessary to find out how and whether we consider certain results to be correct.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Naturally, when it comes to measurements, the first thing to do is to develop criteria.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
What exactly are we going to measure?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000
The number of products, the number of dismissals, the number of missed working days,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
the number of horizontal and vertical movements, the number of material stimuli,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
the number of employees to be trained, and so on.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
We must discuss the criteria that we will measure.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Because you can measure anything.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:02.000
The question is how significant these criteria are in order to solve the development tasks

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
that are before our particular organization.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Again, after we have developed these criteria, it is necessary to determine whether each of these criteria is useful.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Are all these criteria really significant or are they secondary?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Naturally, it is obvious that by increasing the salary, people will be satisfied.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:32.000
The whole question is what is the ratio of salary increase and labor productivity.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Let's recall the same Khatunov experiments with informal relations.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Let's recall the same Taylor with his scientific organization of labor.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Indeed, material stimulation is good to a certain extent.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000
But when these limits are reached,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:00.000
then material stimulation no longer significantly affects any result.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the importance and significance of the criteria we have set.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
This is another task, and the task is no less important than the development of the criteria themselves.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.000
The next task is to assess the efficiency of the organization.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
We believe that the organization is effective.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
We believe that the organization covers a large segment of the market, that the profit is growing.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Is the organization effective?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Maybe it is not an intensive, but an extensive growth.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000
The organization really increases the profit due to quantitative indicators.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
We already know and consider that quantitative indicators are good for a certain approach.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000
In the end, you can produce a huge number of aluminum spoons,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
but, accordingly, these spoons will not be in demand.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Accordingly, the organization will lose its effectiveness.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
This is a huge problem for all Soviet organizations,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
which collapsed in the 1990s.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
They were ineffective because they produced the product that was not in demand.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000
They produced products that were not in demand.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
They were bought because there was nothing.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But when something else appeared, all these enterprises stopped.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Not because they became financed, but simply because their products turned out to be of no use to anyone.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
They lost in the competitive struggle that began.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:50.000
The next direction that must be highlighted in the system of organizational behavior

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:57.000
is the analysis of the quality of life of employees.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.000
We spend at least a third of our working life.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
We sleep almost as much as we do.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
In this regard, the question arises.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:16.000
A person comes to work only to work and run away as soon as possible,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
or a person comes to work with an interest.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
This is the same problem that Taylor talked about,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000
which was very well formulated by Mayor Ed Lisberger of the informal organization Psychological Climate.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:39.000
If a person feels satisfied, if he has a well-developed motivation,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
which will be clear in the theory of motivation,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
then, accordingly, the productivity of labor increases.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.000
So, accordingly, we need to think about why the productivity of individual workers increases,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
what needs to be done to increase this productivity,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
why the productivity of other workers decreases,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000
how to put an end to the decline in the productivity of labor

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and, accordingly, again, to contribute to the growth of this productivity.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
We need to identify factors that are associated with the satisfaction of work.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
What are they?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Material stimuli, non-material stimuli, literacy, people I work with,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
the style of management that is carried out,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
when I am evaluated as a specialist, when my opinion is considered.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And in this case, I can agree even on a lower salary than my competitors,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
but there will be a different attitude to me.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Accordingly, if we identify these factors that are associated with the inner satisfaction of labor,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000
then, accordingly, they will be directly associated with the growth of the efficiency of the organization's productivity.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000
If we conduct an analysis of the quality of working life,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
then we can think about re-planning of working time.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
What did, in fact, Rettlisberger and Dixon do in their experiments?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000
They, from a scientific point of view, simply took the working time

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
and, as a designer, cut it down.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000
When they took a rest, when they took breaks, when they took lunch.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000
But, in fact, if other workers from the control group came to work,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000
sat and worked, then the workers in the experimental group felt the attention to themselves.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And here the re-planning itself was an important element.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
How much is the attitude to them?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But the very structure of the re-planning was also important.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
The same lunches, the same breaks.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
When they were done according to scientific indicators,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
when the girls were really tired, when the number of mistakes increased,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
and it was necessary to rest,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000
then the rest hour was much more successful and much more effective.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:13.000
The next important direction, which is considered in the theory of organizational behavior,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
is the analysis of the psychology of consumers.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Here is a very clear connection with the psychology of consumers of products.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Look, in fact, everything we have talked about so far

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
was about the effectiveness of human behavior in the organization.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
The effectiveness of either the producer of the product,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
or the producer of services.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
But we just talked about the fact that the modern organization,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
the modern paradigm of organizational behavior is associated with the fact

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
that the production of a product is inferior to the production of services.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
The service is what I provide to others for consumption.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Therefore, it is very important for me to know the psychology of consumers.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
As for the psychology of consumers,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000
perhaps this is really the novelty that has brought modern development of business.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
This is the modern state of the theory of organizational behavior.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Because to a large extent,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.000
we must take into account the needs of those consumers of services or products we work on.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Here it is necessary to assess the preferences of consumers.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
What is their demand?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
This is where we can work ahead.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And this is very important from the point of view of services.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
You can offer people something.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
For example, the same tour operators.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But where do these tour trips go?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
To Turkey, to Egypt.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Where does the trend go?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
If we assess the preferences of consumers through psychological research,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
analysis, surveys,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000
then we can predict and determine the market segment,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
which is still free,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
just because no one has done it before.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:15.000
At the same time, it is very important to determine the reaction of consumers to the products offered again.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Today, the industry produces a huge number of equipment,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
video, computer, audio, household appliances.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
They have a lot of opportunities.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But the more of these opportunities, the more difficult it is to use this equipment.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Where is the limit that will be interesting to the consumer?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
You can buy a washing machine, where a huge number of functions are laid.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But at the same time, such a thick instruction is attached to this washing machine.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And let's read it, do not understand.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000
There are a huge number of good foreign cars today,

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
which have a steering memory

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
and a variety of automatic movements,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
which the consumer does not know about.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And as he sat behind the wheel and drove, so he drives.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Both on a Land Rover and on a Zaporozhets.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
But the opportunities are different.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So what is the reaction of consumers to these new opportunities?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
After all, every new opportunity makes the product more expensive.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Where is this limit?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
The ratio, the price, the quality.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
These are the reactions of consumers that also need to be studied.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And this is the big area that is studied with marketing.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Consumer psychology is the section where the theory of organization directly correlates

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000
with both psychology and marketing, when it comes to consumer analysis.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
In marketing, the consumer is one of the leading figures.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Again, if we talk about consumers,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
then we can develop a strategy for segmenting the market.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
We have identified the potential needs that exist.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
We have identified the ratio that exists.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And so we can offer what will really be in demand

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.000
according to the price that is now being considered for this product, for these services.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Thus, we again push the market segment,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
and we are effective from the point of view of business.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
You can talk a lot about consumer psychology.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
This is a separate topic.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
But the main thing that we need now in the theory of organization

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
is to understand that the psychology of consumers is a very significant feature

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
that must be remembered for the effectiveness of the organization's work.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Finally, when we talk about organizational behavior,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
such a serious area as engineering psychology stands out.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:31:00.000
We have already talked about this in part when we talked about the development of the theory of organizational behavior after the war.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Today, technology is becoming very complicated,

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
the means of production are becoming more complicated,

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
the machines on which a person works are becoming more complicated.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And so it is necessary to provide a comfortable working environment for a person to work with technology.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
You can make a very complex machine,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
but a person will not know how to use it.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:29.000
A person will not know the possibilities that this machine gives him in terms of facilitating his work.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Therefore, it is necessary to think about ergonomics,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
about how to arrange certain details,

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
how not to exaggerate the number of indicators,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
signals that appear in front of a person,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
what he can react to.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
In this regard, it is necessary to talk about the design of the working environment,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
a direct problem associated with organizational behavior.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I organize and plan connections that arise between different structures of the organization.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I organize the document turnover that will take place,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I build a hierarchy and a structure of subordination that will be in the organization,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
and thereby I set the boundaries, the boundaries

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
on which the organizational behavior will be implemented.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Again, the next task is related to the optimization of the relationship between a person and a machine.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Today's organization is a high-tech organization.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
No matter what you do, you still use a computer,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
you still use a copy machine,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
you use faxes, you use a modem.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:48.000
And, accordingly, the effectiveness of your activity depends on the ability to use this equipment.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Instead of explaining something on the phone for a long time,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000
send the necessary data or requests by email,

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
and you will not have to explain something on the phone for an hour.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Using the opportunities that the equipment gives us, the environment,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
is also very important, and this is the task that arises in engineering psychology

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
and which naturally determines organizational behavior.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Well, again, it is very important today, from the point of view of innovation,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
from the point of view of new approaches, to use system technologies.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:32.000
It is pointless today, for example, to purchase computers without licensed software.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000
You can have the best computers, which have old software products,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:47.000
which are low-performance and deprived of all the capabilities that can be used on these computers.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000
In this regard, it is necessary to understand the ratio of system qualities.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I must fully use the technical means,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
when I purchase some complex means.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
This will not only make my life easier, it will make it easier for the functional organization,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000
it will increase its efficiency, it will provide it with competitive advantage in the market.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:15.000
These are the tasks that are currently under the organizational behavior that it must solve.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Again, I draw your attention to the fact that these are very specific tasks,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
which have specific outputs, which are measurable.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And it is precisely organizational behavior that is important,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
because it allows you to solve these tasks and assess the result,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
how effective is the investment of funds in those or other innovations,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.000
which exist in a given organization, and what I get in return.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Should I invest these funds, or was it a pointless expense?

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.000
These are the tasks that are under the modern theory of organizational behavior.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And how these tasks are solved is the subject of our further discussions.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000
So, today we have considered the aspects of what organizational behavior is,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
what interdisciplinary discipline it is, and what disciplines it is associated with.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
We have considered the history of organizational behavior, how it has developed,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
what level it has reached today.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
We have considered the paradigm shift, we have considered the applied tasks that are being solved.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And, accordingly, now we will pay attention to how the assigned tasks are solved most optimally

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000
from the point of view of the organization of the functioning of one or another organization.
