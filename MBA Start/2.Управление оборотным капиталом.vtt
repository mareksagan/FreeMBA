00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
And we are moving to the next question, a very important question of our lecture, the question of managing turnover.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
If we have been talking about what is turnover capital of an enterprise,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
that is, we have defined it, indicating its importance for an enterprise,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
now comes the moment of how to manage this capital, how to manage it correctly,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
not to let it go to the dumps, so that the enterprise feels very good.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
This is the second, but the most important question of our lecture.

00:32.000 --> 00:43.000
The practice says that it is possible to choose three types of various policies of managing turnover capital.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
Aggressive, conservative and moderate centrist policy.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Aggressive policy.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
An enterprise that has an aggressive policy of managing its capital is called a fat cat.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Why? What is aggressive policy?

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Aggressive policy implies no restrictions on the growth of current assets.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
No restrictions. Current assets grow, increase, the enterprise feels amazing.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
All its resources are huge, it is aimed at increasing its assets.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
The reserves of this enterprise are gigantic.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
It never has a failure, it has no problems with deliveries.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
It has no failures, it has all the reserves, any reserves.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Fat cat.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
The other side of the coin.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Some of the reserves are dead reserves, unnecessary reserves.

01:47.000 --> 01:56.000
Taking all the risks into account, the enterprise freezes a huge amount of its assets in reserves.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Naturally, the economic profitability of these assets is lower.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
But the enterprise has no problems.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
As they say, if it doesn't hurt, the head will go.

02:09.000 --> 02:20.000
No problems with failures in the production, supply and implementation process.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Aggressive policy of managing capital is typical of passive policy.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
A sign of this policy is a significant pre-emphasis on short-term loan.

02:34.000 --> 02:43.000
The enterprise takes only short-term loans, uses them actively and returns them quickly.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
If short-term loans prevail among all passives, it means that the enterprise is aggressive.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
What does it give to the enterprise? Why does the enterprise use aggressive policy?

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
A short-term loan has its pros and cons.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
The pro of a short-term loan is a lower interest rate.

03:05.000 --> 03:15.000
A short-term loan in a bank can be charged at a lower rate than a long-term loan.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
The second pro of short-term loans is that there are forms of loans

03:22.000 --> 03:33.000
that can be obtained for a period of a month without a deposit.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
But this form of loans has its cons.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
A short-term loan must be returned very quickly.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
Therefore, only a short-term loan can be used by an enterprise

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
that quickly returns its profits to the enterprise.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Only for such enterprises with a short cycle,

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
such a policy of managing capital is possible and real.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
If an enterprise has a longer production cycle, it cannot use this policy.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
If an enterprise takes a short-term loan and invests it in the production process,

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
it has no means to return it.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
At the same time, the use of such a policy gives the enterprise

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
an additional higher level of financial leverage.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Note that if the enterprise has a low interest rate,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
the profitability is high.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
If the enterprise has a high interest rate and profitability,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
the enterprise has a higher level of financial leverage

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
and can earn a higher margin.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Such a policy is chosen by large enterprises,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
which have a lot of money.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
And most importantly, such a policy is chosen by enterprises

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
that cannot be allowed to fail.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
They cannot lose their partners, they cannot stop production.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
But imagine a metallurgical plant.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
What does it mean to have a shortage of supplies

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
and, as a result, to stop the Martenovskaya domino oven?

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
If you stop the domino oven,

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
a goat is formed there, which must be removed from there with great difficulty.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
This is a loss of time, money, and so on.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
There is a production that cannot be stopped in any case.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
There must be a surplus of supplies,

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
it must be insured in all cases.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Here is the policy of a fat cat.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
There is a diametrically opposite policy of asset management.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
It is a conservative policy.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
It is a conservative policy,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
because it is used only by enterprises

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
that have very little turnover.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
So little that they tremble for every penny.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
And they are forced to spend their money

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
only on the most necessary assets.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
They calculate up to every penny,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
they spend it very rationally.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Yes, because of this, their profitability is very high.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
They have a very rational use of money.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
But the opposite side, because they have very few assets,

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
they can have a shortage.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Therefore, a conservative policy can be used

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
when you are forced from poverty,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
when you simply do not have enough money,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
and when every penny is on the account,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
or when the business is highly determined.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
If you have clearly scheduled needs in supplies

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
and in the implementation of production,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
and your uncertainty is reduced to zero or its minimum value,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
then the amount of supplies can be reduced to the minimum value.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
You know exactly when and how much you need,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
and this is determined by the course of the production process.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Therefore, in these two cases, a conservative policy is used.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
A sign of a conservative policy is a low interest rate

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
of a short-term loan in the total amount of passives.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
That is, you pay very little to the bank,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
you take a loan.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
While the sign of a fat cat policy,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
an aggressive policy,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
is a high interest rate of short-term loans.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
In a conservative policy,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
all assets are financed by permanent passives,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
their own funds, long-term loans and loans.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Because short-term loans are used very little.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
And, accordingly, the effect of the financial lever is quite low.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
And the third group of businessmen,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
enterprises that use politics,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
is moderate politics or centrists.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
They do not belong to fat cats or do not work poorly.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
They do not have excess assets

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
or are not in a state

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
when there are no excess assets.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
They are in the middle.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
This is an optimal value

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
that avoids shortcomings that are inherent in the extreme.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
But at the same time,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
it does not give the advantages that these extremes have.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Those who pursue a centrist policy,

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
their risk of unpaid ability is at a certain average value.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
It is acceptable and convenient.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
No one makes any claims to them.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
But at the same time,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
they do not have excess money,

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
thanks to which these risks can be reduced to zero.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
A sign of moderate politics of centrists

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
is the absence or very low interest rate of short-term loans

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
in the total amount of passives.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
There are practically no short-term loans.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
If we combine all the signs we listed in one table,

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
we will get a matrix of the choice of politics,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
operative management of current assets and passives.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Please look at the slide that is in front of you.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
You see the matrix

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
in which the policy of management of current assets

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
is divided into three types.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
We have just discussed three types.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Aggressive, moderate and conservative.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
The intersection of these types of management

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
gives us the financial policy

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
that is applied at the enterprise.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
You can see from this slide

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
that aggressive policy in relation to passives

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
is not combined with conservative policy in relation to assets.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It is impossible,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
there is no such enterprise

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
that could use these two policies.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
The aggressive policy of assets,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
of fat cats,

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
is not combined with conservative policy of passives.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
All other combinations are possible.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
The combination of two aggressive policies

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
gives us an aggressive state of the enterprise.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
The enterprise uses only short-term loans

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
and with the help of these loans

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
it buys huge amounts of stock.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
It has no problems.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
It is an aggressive policy.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
The opposite is the case with the conservative policy

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
of assets and passives.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
The enterprise takes care of every penny

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
and looks at its expenses very scrupulously.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
At the same time,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
it does not use short-term loans,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
but only works with long-term loans.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
This is called the conservative policy

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
of using assets and passives.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
All other combinations

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
give us a moderate policy.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
A moderate policy of assets and passives.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
If you ask me what is the best form of policy

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
for the enterprise,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I will tell you that there is no such form

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
that would be ideal,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
that you should strive for.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
The form is determined by the state

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
of the enterprise.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
If the enterprise has a huge amount of money,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
it is more convenient for it to have an aggressive policy.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Of course, such an enterprise

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
is able to take care of its reputation

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
in the market.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
It cannot afford any failures.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Therefore, it leads an aggressive policy.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
The enterprise is not able to pay

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
for its reliability in the market.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
On the contrary,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
when the enterprise has no money,

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
it has no other policy but the conservative one.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Life itself makes it work

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
in the conditions of the conservative policy.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
If the enterprise is in a normal state,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
it leads a moderate policy.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
It uses short-term money,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
but it does not spend it left and right.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
It rationally invests it in the reserves.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
There is no surplus in these reserves.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
This is how the vast majority of enterprises work.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
If you want to work as a vast majority of enterprises,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
which is a normal state for a business,

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
you should choose a moderate policy of cooperative management

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
with the current assets and passives.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Later we will talk about how the management

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
of the elements of the turnover assets happens.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
One of the most important elements of the turnover assets,

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
as we have discussed today, is the reserves.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
The reserves are the assets that are intended

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
for the enterprise to function normally

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
within its business cycle.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
In order to ensure a normal,

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
rhythmic state of the enterprise.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
As you remember, the enterprise's production cycle

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
consists of three parts.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
The first part is the raw materials purchase.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
There are the production processes.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
There is the unfinished production.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Some of the raw materials are in the form of unfinished production.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
There is the finished product in the warehouse,

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
which is not yet implemented.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Some of the raw materials are in this form.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Each of these forms is needed by the enterprise.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
It should only choose the optimal combination

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
and distribute its reserves between these forms.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
And depending on how it distributes these reserves,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
the financial stability of this enterprise depends.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
We have already discussed today that the reserves

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
are influenced not only by the production structure,

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
but also by the seasonality.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
The reserves are also influenced by the purpose of the production.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
It happens that the product needs to be produced

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
at a strictly defined date,

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
and accordingly, the reserves need to be prepared

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
for this date.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
We have already said that the reserves should be

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
distributed in a way that is not

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
in the way of the production process.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
What will the enterprise get?

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
What negative aspects will be characteristic for the enterprise?

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
We should know what is negative and what is not.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
This should be the evidence of the inoptimal

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
distribution of the reserves.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
What is the evidence?

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
First of all, if the quantity of reserves increases,

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
it should tell us about the increase in the production volume.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
The larger the production volume,

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
the larger the quantity of reserves.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
To produce more products, you need to buy more raw materials,

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
to have more products in incomplete production,

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
so the quantity of reserves is always compared

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
with the quantity of production volume.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
If the quantity of reserves is the same,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
the quantity of production volume does not play a negative role.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
If the volume of production increases by two times,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
the quantity of reserves could also increase by two times.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
This is a normal state of operation of the enterprise.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
But if the quantity of reserves increases by two times,

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
and the volume of production increases by 10%,

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
this is not a normal state.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
We need to look closely at why this happened.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Of course, if there was a lack of reserves before,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
this can indicate the transition to the optimal mode.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
But if before that we had an optimal reserve mode,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
then the increase of reserves is faster than the increase of production volume,

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
which indicates that there is an abnormal increase in the reserves,

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
and, accordingly, their freezing.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
The increase in the quantity of reserves is also used by the business

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
to protect against inflation.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
If inflation grows at a very high rate,

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
the business is protected from it.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
We, as individuals,

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
at high rates of inflation were protected

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
by the fact that we were transferring money from a weak currency

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
to a stronger currency, for example, dollars or euros,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
and those that had less inflation

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
were able to save their money.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
Legal entities do not have the opportunity

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
to transfer money from one currency to another,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
so they use another form of saving money in the condition of inflation.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
They increase their reserves.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
The thing is that the reserves that have been acquired

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
have not grown in price.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
They have been bought, and they are available,

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
and can be used at any time.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
But after some time,

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
those same reserves will cost more.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
Therefore, in the condition of inflation,

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
free money was used to buy reserves.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
They are still needed, they will still be used in production.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
It is more profitable to store them in reserves than to depreciate them.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
Another thing is that here, again,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
you can store money in the form of reserves,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
you can store it in another form, for example, in a bank deposit.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
You can only compare what is economically more profitable

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
to invest in a bank at a percentage,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
or to protect from inflation.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
The mechanism that will give more benefit is more profitable to use.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Usually,

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
it is more profitable to protect from inflation

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
than to use it as a deposit.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Therefore, enterprises increase the volume of reserves,

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
preferring to increase the investment of money in deposits.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
The ineffectiveness of the use of reserves

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
is also caused by excessive freezing of reserves

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
in the form of unfulfilled production

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
or in the form of reserves in the raw material warehouse.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
If there is an excessive amount of reserves,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
it leads to the fact that enterprises

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
are not effectively using their money.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Therefore, excessive increase of reserves is harmful.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
When we have a shortage of reserves at the enterprise,

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
it is also not good.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
If the enterprise is short of reserves,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
then the enterprise starts to break down in production,

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
the rhythm of production is disrupted.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
This is also bad, because the enterprise is in a frenzy,

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
it stops.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
There are no steering wheels,

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
and the whole auto-vase has stopped.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
The small detail, from which the entire conveyor of the auto-vase has stopped.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
Everything is needed.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
The enterprise should work rhythmically, without interruptions.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Therefore, there should be a sufficient amount of reserves.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Another thing is that the shortage of reserves

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
is overloaded.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
And it starts to produce less than it is able to produce.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
The volume of the enterprise's income

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
decreases.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
The enterprise receives less income than it can produce.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
If the enterprise does not work

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
with its maximum capacity,

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
its production cost increases.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
The fact is that the enterprise has all the main means

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
that are amortized.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
If the enterprise reduces the volume of production,

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
then more and more funds are needed

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
to amortize the production.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Remember, we once said that it is much more profitable

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
to produce more pencils than one pencil.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Because one pencil amortizes the entire enterprise.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
And the cost of a pencil is so huge

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
that it is like gold.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
And when a lot of pencils are produced,

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
then the cost of a pencil is small.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Because all amortization is due to a huge amount of produced products.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
And it is not profitable for the enterprise to reduce the volume of produced products.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Because then the cost of production increases.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
And the cost of production increases.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
And the enterprise receives less income than it can produce.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
All this together leads to a deterioration of the financial state of the enterprise.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
And the task of every financial director

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
is not to allow the deterioration of the financial situation of the enterprise.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Therefore, the amount of reserves should be optimal.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
And how to calculate the amount of reserves needed for the enterprise?

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Here is the formula in front of you.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
Look carefully at the screen

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
and you will see how the amount of funds

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
allocated to the reserves is calculated.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
You see that this amount is equal to the production

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
of the average daily volume of reserves

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
by the norm of the reserve storage.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
This is the amount of funds that should be spent on reserves

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
if you were not credited.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
Your partners in the market

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
did not provide you with a return,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
or rather a timeout of reserves

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
in the form of a commercial loan.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
But since we live in a real market

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
where it is customary to provide commercial reserves in the term of the loan,

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
we must subtract the amount of reserves needed

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
from the amount of reserves needed

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
for a certain period of time.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
Therefore, you see in this formula

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
the amount of funds allocated

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
for the financial volume of the reserve.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
The amount of funds allocated

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
is calculated according to the type of reserves

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
that are required.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
And the amount of funds needed

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
is determined by the amount of funds

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
that are allocated.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
If we bring a huge amount of reserves,

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
our transport costs become minimal.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
Of course, we loaded a huge amount of transport funds

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
and delivered a large amount of reserves.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
But the more the amount of reserves that we bring,

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
the more the amount of funds that we bring

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
the more the stock is needed for its storage.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
And by saving on transport costs,

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
we get huge costs for storage.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
We need to build a huge warehouse,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
we need a lot of workers to serve it,

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
we need to make additional costs for storage.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
Thus, we see that huge reserves

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
are needed for storage.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
But there is a reverse situation.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
If we want to have minimal costs for storage,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
not to have a warehouse at all,

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
or to have a small warehouse

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
with small costs for its service,

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
then we should often bring our reserves and update them.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
And despite the fact that the costs for storage

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
will be small, the costs for transportation will be large.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
For an enterprise, the cost is the amount of costs

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
for both storage and transportation.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
And the enterprise should minimize this amount.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
This task is solved mathematically

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
and the amount of reserves is obtained

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
when the total costs are minimal.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
The Wilson model is presented

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
in the form of a formula on the slide.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
The optimal size of the batch

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
that should be brought

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
to minimize the total costs

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
is determined in this way.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
The estimated amount of goods purchased

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
and the cost of goods delivered

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
is calculated in this way.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
The estimated amount of goods delivered

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
is the optimal size of the batch.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
If an enterprise knows about this,

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
and buys reserves with such amounts,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
then it will be able to minimize the costs.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
Let's take an example

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
that would reinforce our theoretical idea

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
about buying raw materials.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
Let's say that we have a yearly demand for raw materials

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
in the amount of 1 million rubles.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
The current costs for delivery are 12 thousand rubles,

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
but the optimal size of the batch is 12 thousand rubles.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
We substitute the Wilson formula

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
and find that the optimal size

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
of raw materials should be delivered

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
to 63 thousand rubles.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
Since we need a yearly demand of 1 million rubles,

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
we can calculate how many times a year

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
we should deliver raw materials.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
1 million divided by 63 thousand is 16 times.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
That is, we should deliver raw materials

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
not more, but not less.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Because more times and less times

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
will increase our costs for raw materials.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
And with 16 times we will have the lowest costs.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
In other words, every 22 days

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
we should receive a new batch of raw materials.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
At the same time, the costs for service will be minimal.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
This is how this optimization task is solved.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
And every enterprise that deals with the production process

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
is able to calculate how often

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
and what batch of reserves it needs to update

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
in order to have the lowest costs for reserves.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
The next issue we will discuss

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
is the issue of managing the debit debt.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
We have learned to manage reserves,

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
we still have to learn to manage the debit debt.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
The debit debt is owed to your enterprise,

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
but it has not been received yet.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
These are the funds that you have given to other enterprises

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
and they use these funds, but they must be returned to you.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
The other thing is when and under what conditions.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
We have already talked about the fact

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
that the debit debt is a sign of the market.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
If an enterprise does not transfer

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
a part of the finished product

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
in the form of a credit to another enterprise,

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
the enterprise will forget about it

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
and the consumers will transfer it to competitors

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
who provide the credit.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
Therefore, since we are within the market,

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
the debit debt is a sign of the market.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
It is a sign that we are within the market.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
Therefore, it exists in all enterprises

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
that are connected with production and trade.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
The other thing is that the debit debt

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
must be of the optimal size.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Again, the excessive size of the debit debt

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
is a negative thing.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
We must understand that when an enterprise

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
provides a debit debt,

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
it distracts its own funds and transfers them

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
to other enterprises and cannot use them

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
in its own business.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
On the other hand, it is forced to do so

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
because the size of the debit debt

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
is influenced by several factors.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
The first one is the customer's reliability.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Before providing a credit to a customer,

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
any enterprise evaluates the reliability

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
of the customer as a business partner.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
If the customer is reliable and has bought

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
your product and paid for it in time,

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
then such an enterprise can be provided

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
with a credit and a debit debt.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Since you are sure that you will be paid

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
the money amount as it should be

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
according to the contract in a strictly

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
negotiated time, the business process

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
is not over.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
If you do not know the business partner,

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
if he is new to the market,

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
if he is not familiar with the enterprise

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
and if he is likely to work well

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
in the market, you can refuse to provide

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
a credit to this business partner.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
In order to do so, you will be asked

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
to pay a credit.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
In this case, you will do the right thing

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
from the business point of view

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
because all your competitors will do the same

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
with this business partner.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
You will not lose here.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
In the early 90s, when capitalism

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
was just emerging in our country

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
and our enterprises were buying

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
foreign goods for import and bringing

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
them to the country to implement it here,

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
all our trade organizations

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
were talking about the unfair attitude

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
of the trade companies.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
Foreign companies were provided

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
with credit, but our companies were not.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Our enterprises were forced to buy

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
on prepayment.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
Why? Because we were not reliable

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
trade partners.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
No one knew us, no one trusted us,

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
no one believed in us.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
But the years decide.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
Those enterprises that for many years

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
were reliable partners,

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
started to receive credit.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
And today, Russian enterprises,

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
just like inside the country,

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
provide our customers with credit.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
Therefore, the customer's assessment

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
of their reliability is the most important

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
point in the decision of whether to provide

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
a credit or not.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
But one thing is to provide a credit,

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
not to let the business go to the dump.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
Therefore, all the enterprises,

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
although they trust their partners,

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
but they strictly monitor the debt.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
At every enterprise that provides

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
a credit, there are employees

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
who are responsible for the state

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
of the debt.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
They work with their partners,

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
ask them to pay the debt back

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
on time.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
Therefore, the control of the debt

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
is the most important part of every enterprise.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
If you don't remind your partner

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
about the debt, he can forget about it.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
The thing is that our enterprises

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
don't always use the sanctions

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
when providing the credit.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
And if the sanctions are not used

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
for the credit, or even worse,

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
if they are written in the contract

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
and are not required,

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
then enterprises forget

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
that they should pay the debt on time.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
And it can take a long time.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
And the long term of the debt

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
without the reward

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
leads to the loss of the enterprise.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
And the enterprise has to pay

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
a lot of money for the debt.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
And the money doesn't work,

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
it doesn't bring income to the enterprise.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
And the most important thing is

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
that the debt is a business mechanism.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
It is a necessary element

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
of the process.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
The enterprise's debt should be

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
in the optimal state.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
And there should be a certain amount.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
If the enterprise has a sharp increase

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
or decrease in the debt,

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
it indicates a certain process.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
What is the evidence of the sharp increase

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
of the enterprise's debt?

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
The first thing that should be noticed

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
is that we have to compare the enterprise's debt

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
with the production volume.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
If the volume of the enterprise's debt

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
and the volume of the enterprise's debt

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
is the same,

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
it means that we have just given the product

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
to the partners who buy it.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
And nothing bad happened.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
If the enterprise's debt

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
grows faster than the volume of the enterprise's debt,

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
it means that the enterprise's debt

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
is not being used.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
And if the volume of the enterprise's debt

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
is faster than the volume of the enterprise's debt,

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
it means that the enterprise's debt

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
is not being used.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
It means that the enterprise's debt

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
is not being used.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
And it is not being used.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
And it is not being used.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
But the enterprise's debt is not growing

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
only because the volume of the enterprise's debt is increasing.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
Sometimes the enterprise's debt is overdue

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
when the enterprise you gave the product

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
does not pay back its debt.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
And sometimes the enterprise is not able to pay back.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
And it can be even about bankruptcy

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
of some of the buyers.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
It is a disturbing signal.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
You should know the financial condition of your partners.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
You should know how their business is going.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
So it is better not to let such a situation happen.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
And it is a very extreme case

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
when the enterprise's debt is used

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
to wash away the money.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
When the partners are given the money

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
not for the credit,

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
but to use it for another purpose.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
And it is a very extreme case.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
The sign of such a mechanism

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
of using the money

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
is that the enterprise's debt

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
is not being used for the payment.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
It is not being used.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
It is forever.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
And in three years it can be used for the payment.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
If the enterprise has such a debt

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
it is a reason for the state authorities

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
and the Tax Administration

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
to pay attention to the state of such a debt.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
And the most important reason

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
is that the owners of the enterprise

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
should pay attention

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
to how their employees use the money.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
If the owner of the enterprise

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
is not aware of the fact

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
that the employees use the money

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
it is a reason to make

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
the appropriate organizational conclusions.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
We are still talking about

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
the increase of the enterprise's debt.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
And what happens if the enterprise's debt

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
is reduced?

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
If the reduction of the enterprise's debt

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
is connected with the reduction

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
of the production load

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
it is a normal phenomenon

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
that the enterprise's debt is reduced.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
There is nothing wrong with it.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
But on the other hand

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
the reduction of production load

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
is a sign of the reduction of the enterprise's business activity.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
This is a negative moment.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
The reduction of the enterprise's debt

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
is a consequence of this.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
It cannot be seen as a negative phenomenon.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
On the other hand

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
the reduction of the enterprise's debt

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
can be seen as a positive phenomenon

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
if it is connected with the reduction of the period of its reduction.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
The total amount of the enterprise's debt

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
is the sum of all the money.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
Therefore, if the period of the debt reduction is reduced

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
it is a positive phenomenon.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
It will be returned faster.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
And for the enterprise it is a positive phenomenon.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
Thus, it is impossible to judge

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
whether the increase or reduction of the enterprise's debt

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
is a positive phenomenon.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
The only negative moment is

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
the change of the enterprise's debt.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
The change of the debt is a result of the analysis

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
of the change of the enterprise's debt.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
The only way to judge it is to analyze

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
whether it is a positive or a negative phenomenon.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
The enterprise's debt can be distinguished

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
between a normal and a temporary one.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
The normal one is a result of the business process.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
The business demands a 30-day extension.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
Therefore, the 30-day enterprise's debt is normal.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
But if during the period of the contract

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
the enterprise's debt is not returned

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
then it becomes a temporary debt.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
It is kept longer than the contract.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
The temporary debt is harmful for the enterprise.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
The enterprise has lost the money

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
it needs for normal functioning.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
The enterprise starts to work actively

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
to return the temporary debt.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
Thus, when the enterprise is organized

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
by the service that is engaged in the temporary debt

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
this service performs a double work.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
It tracks the normal debt

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
and does an active work to return the temporary debt.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
The temporary debt can be managed.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
The service that is created for this purpose

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
is engaged in this process.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
How is it done?

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
There are two phenomena in the management of the temporary debt.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
The first one is the comparison of the additional profit

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
with the costs of changing the policy.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
What does it mean?

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
The enterprise could use a double work.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
On the one hand, it could give the debt in the form of a credit

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
and on the other hand, it could deposit it in the bank.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
Comparing these two processes

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
we can see which one is more profitable for the enterprise.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
And in a certain direction

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
we can send the money.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
If the work with the banks is not profitable

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
the enterprise uses the debt.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
If the deposit in the bank is more profitable

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
then the money is sent in the form of the debt

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
in the form of the credit for the enterprise.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
This is one direction.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
The second direction is related to the comparison

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
and optimization of the extended term of the debt and the credit.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
The fact is that we provide the debt

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
and the credit.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
And, accordingly,

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
comparing these two processes

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
we should strive

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
to make the amount

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
that we receive

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
more or less than the amount

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
that we give to our partners.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
In order to realize the production

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
the enterprise actively uses

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
the debt.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
And with the help of the debt

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
the enterprise is able to sell the goods.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
Why is it done?

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
The discount is needed to activate the sale process.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
If the enterprise receives a discount

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
depending on the volume of the purchase

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
the more the volume of the purchase

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
the more discount the partner receives.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
Thus, discounts are used

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
to increase the volume of the production.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
The use of discounts leads to the increase

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
of the volume of the production and the increase of the debt.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
With the help of discounts

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
the debt can be regulated.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
We want to increase the debt

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
and we want to use it as a tool.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
Thus, we should look at the discounts.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
Using the discount mechanism

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
we can actively use the debt mechanism.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
Why else can we use the discount process?

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
The fact is that sometimes

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
the enterprise lacks the money.

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
The enterprise tries to replenish the money

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
but it's not always fast.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
For example, it's not always easy

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
to get the money in the bank.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
Even a short-term loan takes time.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
And the money needs to be fast.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
So, discounts are used.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
The discount mechanism is used

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
to increase the volume of the production

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
and to get additional money for the enterprise.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
Discounts can also be used

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
instead of fines.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
In fact, usually, the contract

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
uses a combination of the loan

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
and the debt.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
But, as practice has shown,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
it's not the most effective way

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
to manage the debt.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
There is a more effective way.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
The enterprise gets an additional discount

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
if it returns the money

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
before the contract expires.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
So, the contract says

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
that the loan will be granted for 30 days.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
If the money is not returned in 30 days,

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
there will be fines of the same amount.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
And there is an additional condition.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
If the enterprise returns the money

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
before the contract expires,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
it will get a discount on the product

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
it purchased.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
This is the most effective way

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
to pay off the debt.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
Because the enterprise

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
wants to reduce the costs

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
of the company's financial policy

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
and to pay off the debt in advance.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
And to get additional discounts

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
on the product it has already purchased.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
In this case, the enterprise

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
that provides such a discount is profitable.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
But, again, we should compare

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
the benefits of the discount

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
with the benefits of the loan.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
Should the enterprise use the money

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
to get additional profit

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
or leave it as a loan

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
to the consumer?

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
If the enterprise's own consumption

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
is more effective than the interest

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
you will have to pay

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
for the money you will get in advance.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
For example, if your business's profitability

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
is 40% per month,

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
and you will get a 1% discount

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
for the money you will get in half a month,

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
you will get a 1% discount.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
Because you will create more profit

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
in your own business

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
than if you leave the money

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
with the enterprise.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
And the enterprise that takes the loan

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
can have a month's discount

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
and you will pay it in advance.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
You just give it an additional opportunity.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
And then the enterprise decides

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
what is more profitable for it.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
So, practice has shown that using

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
such a mechanism in business

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
is the most effective way

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
to get a discount.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
So, take this information

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
and try to use this mechanism

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
in your contracts.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
I think you will find it very useful.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
Besides the discounts I suggest you use,

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
you can use other mechanisms

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
that are not actively used.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
This is a mechanism of imposing fines

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
for the delay of payment.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
The fine should be such

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
that it is more profitable to return it

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
than to pay the fine.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
Many enterprises do not write down

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
the sanctions,

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
because they forget

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
that they have to return the loan.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
And this is a very long process.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
There are many cases

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
when the loan was withdrawn

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
for a month.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
And there were no sanctions.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
The most friendly relations

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
were returned years later.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
Of course, there were no additional

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
compensations in the absence of sanctions.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
At least the amount that was presented

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
as a commodity loan was returned.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
But this is not profitable

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
for the enterprise.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
Because money withdrawn

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
does not bring any additional income

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
to the company.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
The presence of a fine

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
will protect you

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
from the sanctions.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
But if you do not want to quarrel,

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
but want to live in friendly relations,

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
then you can use another way

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
to speed up the return of the loan.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
This is to make a deal

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
with Vexel for a percentage of the payment.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
What does this mean?

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
You provide a commodity loan

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
and get Vexel in exchange.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
It is written that you can

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
provide Vexel to the lender

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
and get the amount you owe.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
This way you have secured yourself.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
You have received the loan and you are paid.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
Instead of seeking a return

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
of the loan, you just provide Vexel

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
and get the payment.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
This is also a very effective mechanism.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
The next mechanism is used

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
when you do not know the business partner

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
and do not give the commodity you produced.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
You just do not give it to the lender

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
but sell it on prepayment.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
Remember, I already told you today

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
that in the early 90s all foreign companies

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
provided commodities for Russian businessmen.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
This was the norm of business behavior.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You do not know the business partner

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and no one knows him.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
First you have to earn a reputation.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
With the help of prepayment

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
a businessman earns his reputation.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And in the 10th time

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
your trust in him grows.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
You do not have to give prepayment.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
The last mechanism

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
that can be used to speed up the return

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
of the debit debt is the factoring mechanism.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I have already mentioned that factoring

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
is a modern, new, growing mechanism

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
for the return of all kinds of debts

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
that are in front of the company.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
For example, the debt of the debitor.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You provide the commodity in the form of a credit

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
and sign a triple contract

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
where the third party is the factoring company

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and you provide all the documents

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
about the return of the commodity.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
The debt is not paid in full,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
usually it is paid in 90%.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
This way the mechanism of factoring

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
has an economic basis

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and does not contain the mechanism

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
of pumping money from the bank.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
The economic mechanism was not a lie.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Factoring companies are developing rapidly.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It is very profitable to use factoring business

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
for the enterprises that are engaged in production.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Moreover, factoring companies

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
not only provide money,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
they also perform other additional functions.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
For example, they can track the return

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
of the debt of the debitor.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Moreover, factoring companies

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
ensure the non-return of the debt of the debitor.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
If an ungrateful partner

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
does not return the debt of the debitor,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
then the factoring company pays for it.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And then it interacts with the debitor

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
to return the money.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
When working with unknown business partners,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
this mechanism is also effective.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
When you are insured and fully guaranteed

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
that your money will return to you

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
in integrity and safety.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But it should be emphasized

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
that the return of the debt of the debitor

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
and the factoring money are only profitable

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
in one case.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
If the profitability of the business

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
is higher than the costs of this scheme,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
if the business is low-profitable,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
then there is no point in resorting

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
to loans in a bank.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
You should work only with your own money.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And it is even better if your business

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
is high-profitable.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
If your business is high-profitable,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
everyone works with you with pleasure.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Banks, factoring companies,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
and the next question we will consider

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
is the management of money assets.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
The fact is that

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
a part of the assets of any enterprise

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
is in the form of money.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
The money is in the account.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
On the one hand, these money

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
should be used to cover the costs

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
of the enterprise.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
For this, you need money

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
to cover such costs every day.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
On the other hand,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
in the condition of inflation,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
keeping an excessively large amount

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
of money in the account is not profitable

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
for the business.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
If there was no inflation,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
then it would be a completely different story.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
But if there is inflation,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
it devalues money every day.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
It is like a clock counting seconds.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It is like a clock counting seconds.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
If you have a lot of money in the account,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
you lose a lot of money every second.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But if there is not enough money,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
you cannot cover your current needs.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
This leads to a failure of production.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Imagine that you cannot buy supplies of raw materials.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Yes, you saved money, but you did not lose money on inflation.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
But your production stopped.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Again, there is a golden mean.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
There should not be too much money in the account,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
but there should be exactly as much as is needed

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
to cover the current needs.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So that you do not have daily problems

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
in your business.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
What are the needs that need to be covered?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Are all the needs that the enterprise has

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
to be covered with money?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
No, only the primary needs,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
which cannot be covered even tomorrow.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
The needs that are more important than their repayment.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
These needs should be covered with money.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And this money should be in the account.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
If there is more money in the account,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
it means that they are not being used effectively.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
They are being lost.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Even if there was no inflation,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
we could also talk about the ineffective use of money.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The money is being used in other forms of assets,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
which bring additional income.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
We should pay attention to this.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
At least the minimum deposit in the bank.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
There is a deposit in the bank, there is additional income.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It's just that the money in the account

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
does not bring any additional income to the enterprise.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
The money in the account is the minimum sacrifice

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
that the enterprise has to make

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
in order to function properly.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
To determine the minimum amount of money

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
that should be in the account,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
we will use the formula presented on the slide.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
The minimum amount of assets

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
for the enterprise is determined

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
as the ratio of the estimated amount of payment

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
for the current economic operations

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
in the coming period according to the plan of income and expenses,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
and the turnover of cash assets in the following period.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Pay attention to the numerator.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
The estimated amount of payment.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
For example, this year we plan

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
to need this amount of money.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And in the denominator,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
the turnover of cash assets in the same period in the past.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
That is, per year,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
how many times cash assets

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
of this enterprise are turned around.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
By dividing one into another,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
we get the amount of money we need in the account.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
The fact is that the assets that we have in the enterprise

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
are constantly turning around.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Remember, liquidity of assets, their ability to turn into cash.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So, the assets are constantly turning around,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
from material form to cash form,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and the amount of money we need

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
should remain the same all the time,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
but not more than the amount required for the current needs.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And the current needs are determined

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
in terms of income and expenses.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
The important thing is that the plan is realistic,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
that the amounts that must be paid

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
in the current period,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and that cannot wait until

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
additional money is turned into cash,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
will be accumulated in order to pay.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
This is the peculiarity of determining

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
the minimum amount of money.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
In conclusion, we will consider an example

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
with which we calculate the amount of money

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
that should be in the account of the enterprise.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
For example,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
according to the plan of income and expenses,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
the turnover of the enterprise per year

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
is estimated at 500 million rubles.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The turnover of cash assets is 25 times per year.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Hence, the question is,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
what is the amount of money that should be in the account?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
According to the formula we have discussed above,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
we divide the total amount of money

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
that should be in the enterprise

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
by the number of turns that occur.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And we get that the minimum amount of money

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
that should be in the account

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
is 2 million rubles.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
What does it mean?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It means that the enterprise should make sure

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
that at the beginning of each day

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
the enterprise has such amount of money.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It can be used, used actively,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and it should be used actively.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Thus, within the turnover,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
this amount should be in the enterprise's account.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And the enterprise works with it,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
actively uses it,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and it is renewed 25 times a year,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
that is, it is restored about 2 times a month.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And again, it is spent 15 days.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And at the end of the cycle,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
it should be restored and spent again.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Thus, we have determined the minimum amount of money

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
that should be in the enterprise

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
and used to fulfill its current payments.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Today's lecture was fully devoted to the work

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
of the enterprise's own assets,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
and the enterprise's own turnover assets.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
We have shown that these own turnover assets

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
play a very important, very significant role

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
in the enterprise's financial life.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
They cannot be left to their own devices.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Their active use allows to significantly improve

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
the financial situation of the enterprise.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And vice versa, if we let it go to the drain,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
the financial situation of the enterprise will go down to zero,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
up to bankruptcy.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The enterprise's financial service should actively work

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
with these money, track them, manage both the debitor's debt

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
and the balance of the money on the account.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
By tracking these three processes and managing them,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
the enterprise will always be in excellent financial shape.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
That is what I wish to all of you who are listening to this lecture.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
All the best to you. See you next time.
