00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
I am a doctor of technical sciences, certified business coach, a partner of ZGroup training company.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
I have experience of practical work on implementation of projects of introduction of electronic operating systems of companies,

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
consulting projects, development of personnel training program and production of software.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
The topic of our meeting today is conflicts and stress.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Modern organization can be classified as complex probability system,

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
that is, it has a number of subsystems, between which contradictions may arise.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
They are an inevitable attribute of such systems.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
It should be noted that there are no organizations without conflicts.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Moreover, the more active and dynamic the organization,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
the more often there are grounds for big and small conflicts in its activity.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Therefore, it is essential to understand the origins of the conflict and to be able to manage it

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
with the flow and resolution of the integral component of the professionalism of the leader.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
During the study of the first part of the course, you will learn about the reasons, types and consequences of conflicts.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
The second part of the course is dedicated to managing conflicts.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
You will get acquainted with direct and indirect methods of managing conflicts,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
negotiation technologies, learn about methods of fighting organizational stress.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
The third part of the course is dedicated to the functions and effectiveness of the conflict.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
As a result of performing practical tasks and solving cases,

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
you will get the skills of solving conflict situations, skills of preparation for negotiations,

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
and with the help of the test you will be able to identify and correct your behavior in conflict situations.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
The role of conflicts and their regulation in modern society is so great

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
that in the second half of the 20th century a special field of knowledge was allocated â€“ conflictology.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
According to its role, the leader of an organization is usually in the center of any conflict

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
and is designed to solve it with all available means.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Managing conflicts is one of the most important functions of a leader,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
for which he spends up to 20% of his working time.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Each manager must know about conflicts, ways of behavior when they arise,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
means and methods of preventing them and resolving them.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Psychologists under the conflict understand the collision of opposite goals,

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
interests, positions, opinions or views of opponents or subjects of interaction.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
In this regard, it is possible to define a conflict as one of the forms of human interaction,

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
based on which various real or illusory, objective and subjective,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
to varying degrees conscious contradictions between people lie,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
with attempts of their resolution against the background of emotions.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
It is clear from this that the basis of conflict situations in a group between individuals

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
is a collision between opposite interests, opinions, goals,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
various ideas about the way of their achievement.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
The authors of the schools of scientific management, administrative school

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
and the concept of bureaucracy by choice believed that the efficiency of an organization

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
is mostly based on determining tasks, procedures, rules, interaction of officials

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
and development of a rational organizational structure.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
And it is these mechanisms that eliminate the conditions that contribute to the manifestation of conflict

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
and can be used to solve the emerging problems.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
The authors belonging to the school of human relations were also inclined to believe

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
that a conflict can and should be avoided.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
They recognized the possibility of a contradiction between different groups of leaders.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
However, they usually considered a conflict as a sign of the inefficiency of the organization's activity

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
and poor management.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
One of the founders of the Chekar school of social psychology, Park,

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
included a conflict as one of the four basic types of social interaction

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
along with competition, adaptation and assimilation, that is, a type of change.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
From his point of view, competition, which is a social form of struggle for existence,

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
being conscious, turns into a conflict, which, thanks to assimilation,

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
is intended to lead to strong mutual contacts and cooperation.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
American sociologist Kozer defines a conflict as an ideological phenomenon

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
reflecting the aspiration and feelings of individuals and social groups

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
in the struggle for objective goals, such as power, status change, redistribution of income,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
revaluation of values, and so on.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
The value of conflicts is that they prevent the system from getting tired,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
open the way to innovation.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
A conflict, as a social action, undoubtedly gives a well-known,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
vividly colored negative effect.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
But it performs an important and positive function.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
A conflict serves as an expression of dissatisfaction or protest,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
informing the conflicting parties about their interests and needs.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
In certain situations, when negative relations between people are controlled,

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
and at least one of the parties defends not only personal, but also organizational interests in general,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
conflicts help to unite with others,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
to mobilize will, mind, to solve fundamentally important issues,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
to improve the moral and psychological climate in the collective.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Moreover, there are situations when a clash between the members of the collective,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
an open and fundamental dispute, is desirable.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
It is better to warn the wrong behavior of a colleague in time,

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
than to let him go, not to react, fearing to spoil the relationship.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
So, there are two main approaches to conflict.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
They are reflected on the next slide.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
In the framework of the first approach,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
a conflict is defined as a clash of interests,

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
a contradiction, a struggle and a confrontation.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
From the position of the second approach,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
a conflict is considered as a process of development of interaction.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Representatives of the first approach recommend to put an end to conflicts.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
Representatives of the second approach believe that a conflict blockade is worse than a conflict itself,

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
and the conflict itself has a number of invaluable advantages

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
from the point of view of the development of the organization.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
The next topic is the causes of conflicts.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
The basis of any conflict is a contradiction,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
which usually leads to constructive,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
for example, to the strengthening of the group dynamics, the development of the collective,

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
or to destructive, for example, to the collapse of the collective.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
An open conflict is most often developed on a business basis,

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
and a hidden and a blurring conflict is associated with human relationships.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Many seemingly business conflicts are actually conflicts

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
that are involved in feelings and relationships of its participants.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
It is very important to determine the causes of the conflict,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
because knowing the causes of the emergence of a particular conflict phenomenon,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
it is easier to take specific steps to block their actions,

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
thereby preventing the negative effect caused by them.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Let's consider a list of causes of a conflict.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
It can be presented in terms of three main groups of causes.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
First, the causes caused by the labor process.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
Second, the causes caused by psychological features of human relationships.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
And third, the causes rooted in the personal nature of the members of the collective.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
There are also causes of conflict caused by the economic state of life in our country,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
which cannot be ignored.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Let's consider the first group of causes caused by the labor process.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
For many labor groups,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
they are the main source of conflict situations.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
First, conflicts are caused by factors

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
that hinder the achievement of the main goal of labor activity,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
that is, the obtaining of certain products.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Such factors can be

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
the direct technological interrelationship of workers,

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
when the actions of one of them negatively affect the effectiveness of the actions of the other,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
for example, when working on a conveyor belt.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
The transfer of problems,

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
the solution of which should have been to go vertically to the horizontal level of the relationship.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
For example, a lack of equipment and tools

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
often leads to conflicts between the workers.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Although it is not they who should solve this problem, but their managers.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
The next group of causes is the non-fulfillment of functional duties in the system of leadership.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
For example, the manager does not provide the appropriate conditions for the successful activity of the subordinates,

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
or vice versa, the subordinates do not fulfill the appropriate requirements of the manager.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Secondly, conflicts in production are caused by factors

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
that hinder the achievement of secondary goals of labor activity,

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
a fairly high income, favorable working and rest conditions.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
This group of factors is related to

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
the interrelationship of people,

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
when the achievement of goals of one of them depends on the other members of the collective.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
Secondly, the insolvency of a number of organizational issues in the vertical,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
that is, the leadership,

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
as a result of which there may be an exacerbation of the relationship between people

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
located on the organizational horizontal.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
And finally, functional violations in the system of leadership,

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
which hinder the achievement of personal goals of both the leader and the subordinate.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Thirdly, conflicts arising in the process of the implementation of labor activity

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
are often caused by the inconsistency of the actions of a person

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
adopted by the norm and life values in his collective.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Or another similar conflict reason

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
is role inconsistencies in the system of leadership.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
For example, when there is a place of inconsistency of the expectations

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
of people who occupy certain positions in the collective

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
with their real actions.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
That is, it seems that a person is not coping with his duties.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
And finally, the reasons caused by the psychological features of human relations.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
The most striking example of this kind of features

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
is mutual sympathy and antipathy of people

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
leading to their compatibility or incompatibility.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
It would seem that a rather harmless factor,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
sympathy-antipathy,

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
concerns only two or a few more people,

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
but it can have more serious consequences for the whole collective.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
After all, often different kinds of personnel appointments at enterprises

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
are based on this very principle.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
In turn, the injustice of official appointments,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
as a rule, is due to exacerbation of interpersonal relations.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Several more reasons for such conflicts can be highlighted.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
This is an unfavorable psychological atmosphere in the collective,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
which can be caused by the formation of opposing groups,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
cultural and aesthetic differences of people,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
actions of the leader, and so on.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
And bad psychological communication.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
That is, people do not understand, do not take into account the intentions,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
the state of each other,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
do not consider each other's needs.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
In psychology, the concept of territoriality is also used,

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
which implies the occupation of a Personality or a group of a certain space

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
and the establishment of control over it and the objects or objects in it.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
Moreover, it is customary to highlight group and individual territoriality.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
With the appearance of territoriality,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
we often encounter in everyday life,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
including at work.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
People who join a particular working group

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
occupy a certain territory,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
a working space or a rest room,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
and the occupation of it by other members of the group or by members of another group

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
is often surrounded by intergroup clashes.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
In the same way, each member of the group occupies a part of the common space

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
together with the objects there.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Without enthusiasm, they are prone to invasion.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
For example, having our own desk,

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
it is unlikely that we will be happy to find someone else's work during a meeting.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
If such a situation occurs again,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
it can cause irritation and conflict.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
The reasons for the conflict rooted in the personal nature of the members of the group

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
should also be considered.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
In this case, I mean possible personal features

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
leading to conflict situations.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
This is the inability to control one's emotional state,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
low self-esteem,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
aggressiveness, increased anxiety,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
excessive principle or incommunicability.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Demographic characteristics also play an important role in this process.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
According to the research, for women,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
there is a characteristic tendency to have more conflicts

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
related to their personal needs,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
such as salary, distribution of vacations.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Men are more prone to conflicts

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
related to their work activities,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
that is, the organization of work,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
the determination of work functions.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
With the increase in the age of workers,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
conflicts related to the purposeful characteristics of their activities are taken into account.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
At the same time, the number of conflicts caused by the problems

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
of adapting workers in the working group,

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
such as violation of the labor discipline or discomfort with the requirements, is reduced.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
So, the main reasons for the conflict are

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
1. Distribution of resources.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Resources are always limited in an organization,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
and the management must decide how to distribute materials,

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
information, human resources and finances between different groups

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
in order to achieve the goals of the organization in the most effective way.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
People, as a rule, take their problems closer

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
and always want to get more, not less.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
The need to share resources almost inevitably leads to various kinds of conflicts.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
2. The difference in goals.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Specialized units of the organization and even subgroups

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
form their own goals,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
bear responsibility for their achievements

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
and receive a payment for the final result.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
Therefore, the units can pay more attention to their achievements

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
than to the goals of the whole organization.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
The difference in goals is often seen between the person and the group.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
3. The next reason is the interdependence of tasks.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
The possibility of a conflict exists everywhere,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
where one person or group depends on the performance of a task

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
from another person or group.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
The reason for the conflict, as a rule, is that

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
neither the function, nor the means, nor the duties,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
nor the power, nor the responsibility are clearly distributed

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
among the units and workplaces.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
4. The next reason is the difference in ideas and values.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
The difference in values is a very common cause of conflict.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Instead of objectively assessing the situation,

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
people focus on those views, alternatives and aspects of the situation

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
that, in their opinion, are favorable for the group and personal needs.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
5. The next reason is unsatisfactory communication.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
It can act as a catalyst for conflict,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
preventing individual workers or groups

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
from understanding the situation or from the point of view of others.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
The common problems of information transmission causing conflict

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
are ambiguous quality criteria,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
inability to accurately determine the duties and functions

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
of all employees and units,

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
as well as the presentation of mutually exclusive requirements for work.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
These problems can arise if they are deepened

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
due to the inability of the leaders to develop and provide the information

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
of the subordinates with an accurate description of the duties.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
Poor information transmission is also a consequence of the conflict.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Thus, the level of communication between its participants decreases,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
wrong ideas about each other begin to form,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
hostile relations develop.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
All this leads to the intensification and continuation of the conflict.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
6. The next reason is the imbalance of jobs.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
It is a frequent source of conflict in the organization.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Such a conflict develops if the duties are not fully supported

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
by the means, rights and power.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
7. The next reason is the wrong control.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Control during management should not be dictated by suspicion.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
If the management uses uncertain and total control,

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
then in such a situation a person constantly feels guilty

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
and, in the end, loses self-control,

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
and because of nervousness, he really starts to work worse.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
8. The next reason is the difference in the manner of behavior and life experience.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Studies show that all employees,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
depending on their adherence to conflicts,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
can be divided into three groups.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
1. Aggressive groups.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
The number of the last group is about 6-7% of the entire staff.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
Among the difficult people, five types of insatiable calm stand out.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
First of all, aggressive.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
They are divided into three subtypes.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
These are tanks, snipers and bombers.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Tanks are absolutely sure that their advice is the most competent.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
The only thing they don't like is the aggressive reactions from those they communicate with.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
To achieve any success in a dispute with tanks,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
they need to be given the opportunity to release steam.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
Snipers shoot at people with various sharpness and acuity,

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
and thus cause discomfort in the collective actions of the staff.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
The most effective way to influence them

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
is to demand a detailed explanation of what they mean by one or another of their acuity.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
Bombers are the types that attack the opponent with armor,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
while artistically coming out of themselves,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
so that it seems as if they were strongly offended.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
They need to let the accumulated emotions spill out of them.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
The next type is the complainants.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
These people describe their troubles so vividly

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
that the listener often has doubts in their favor.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
The best thing to do in such cases

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
is to paraphrase the complaints in your own words,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
making it clear that their experiences are noticed.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
The next type is the indecisive.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
People of this type take so many test steps

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
before doing anything that they cause irritation in others.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
The indecisive avoid those who put pressure on them.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
They do the things they are forced to do without enthusiasm.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The next type is the irresponsible.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
To some extent, these are anxious personalities,

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
and their anxiety does not cause them to leave the conflict, but aggression.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
And if they feel warm towards themselves,

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
their behavior, as it were, will naturally enter the framework.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
And the next type is the all-knowing.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
They are essentially valuable workers,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
but they behave in such a way that

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
only the feeling of inferiority is caused by others.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
It should be remembered that they rarely agree to admit their mistakes.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
And the last two reasons for conflict that I would like to note.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
This is the lack of respect for the leadership.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
If most employees feel that the style and management methods

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
do not meet the practical needs,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
this can be the cause of a conflict situation.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
The dissatisfaction with the level of the manager's business or management competence

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
has a great demotivating potential.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
It is obviously important to know that the staff is waiting for their leaders

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
and draw the appropriate conclusions from this.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
And the last reason is insufficient motivation.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
If it is possible to achieve a coincidence of the needs of individuals with the needs of the organization,

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
it is clear that the staff will be laid out to satisfy these needs,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
which will not provide any compulsion.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Remember Peter Drucker and his management of goals.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
Therefore, the necessary signs of conflict are the presence of contradictory goals,

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
directions of movement or intentions, and the presence of conflicting sides,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
that is, subjects capable of activity, not just behavior.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
Accordingly, conflict activity consists in such a transformation of the environment

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
or in the impact on it, which allows one of the conflicting sides

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
to achieve his goal or move in the chosen direction.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
The next topic is the types of conflicts.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
In social psychology, there is a multidimensional typology of conflict

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
depending on the criteria that are taken as the basis.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Two forms of conflicts that occur in everyday workplaces can be identified.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
A significant conflict is a fundamental disagreement

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
regarding the goals or tasks set, as well as the means of their achievement.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
A dispute with the boss about the plan of further actions,

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
for example, a marketing strategy for a new product, is an example of a significant conflict.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
The most frequent disagreements arise regarding group or organizational goals,

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
placement of resources, distribution of rewards, policies and procedures,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
as well as appointments for work.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
An emotional conflict implies interpersonal problems

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
resulting from a feeling of anger, distrust, displeasure, fear, indignation.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Such a conflict is a clash of characters.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
People's energy is spent on emotional conflicts.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
They distract them from important work tasks.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Emotional conflicts can arise in a wide variety of situations

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
in relations between colleagues and between bosses and subordinates.

22:55.000 --> 23:03.000
The last type of conflict is probably the most difficult organizational conflict for a person experiencing it.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
Speaking of the levels of conflicts, it should be noted that people at work

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
may experience an interpersonal conflict or face conflicts at the intergroup or interorganizational level.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
Interpersonal conflicts are clashes within the personality

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
equal in strength, but opposite motives, needs or interests.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
A conflict of the type of approach has place in those cases

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
when a person has to choose between two positive and equally attractive alternatives.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
An example is a choice between getting a higher position in one organization

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
or a new job in another company.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
A conflict of the type of avoidance is observed when a person has to choose

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
between two negative and equally unattractive alternatives.

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
An example is a situation when a person has to either agree to transfer to another job,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
to another city or to leave the job.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
A conflict of the type of approach has place in those cases

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
when a person has to decide on something that will have both positive and negative consequences.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
An example is a proposal of a higher paid job

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
coupled with higher personal time costs.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
An interpersonal conflict occurs between two or more individuals

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
who are in opposition to each other.

24:39.000 --> 24:45.000
It can be significant, emotional or both at the same time.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
Two people fiercely arguing with each other about the benefit of hiring a consultant

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
is an example of a significant interpersonal conflict.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
Two people who are constantly arguing about what kind of clothes to wear to work

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
is an illustration of an emotional interpersonal conflict.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
A conflict between an individual and a group can arise

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
if this individual occupies a position that differs from the position of the group.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
For example, discussing at a meeting the way to increase the volume of sales,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
the majority will believe that this can be achieved by reducing the price.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
And someone will be convinced that such a tactic will lead to a decrease in profit.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Although this person, whose opinion differs from the opinion of the group,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
can take the interests of the company close to his heart,

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
but still he can be considered as a source of conflict

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
because he is against the opinion of the group.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
An intergroup conflict is a conflict between organizations consisting of many formal and informal groups.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
Even in the best organizations, conflicts can arise between such groups.

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
Informal groups, which believe that the leader treats them unfairly,

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
can get together more tightly and try to settle the issue by reducing productivity.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
A vivid example of an intergroup conflict is a conflict between a trade union and an administration.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
Interorganizational conflicts are best considered from the point of view of competition and rivalry,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
characterizing the activities of companies on the same market.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
But an interorganizational conflict can be much deeper than competition on the market.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
For example, the disagreement between trade unions and organizations

26:31.000 --> 26:39.000
that employ their members, between government institutions and organizations under their supervision,

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
between manufacturers and those who supply them with raw materials.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
The classification of conflicts depends on a number of factors.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
The method of their resolution, the nature of the occurrence,

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
the consequences for the participants, the degree of expressiveness, the number of participants.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
Antagonistic conflicts are resolutions of contradiction

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
in the form of destruction of the structures of all conflicting parties

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
or refusal of all parties except one from participating in the conflict.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
This one party wins.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
Compromising conflicts allow several options for their resolution

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
due to mutual change of the goal of the participants of the conflict,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
deadlines, conditions of interaction.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
For example, the supplier does not deliver the ordered product to the manufacturer on time

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
due to the lack of funds for the last shipment.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
The factory has the right to require the execution of the delivery schedule,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
but the conditions have changed for the partner.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
Perhaps, with such mutual interest, it is possible to achieve a compromise,

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
that is, to change the delivery schedule,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
to help with the loan, to enter into negotiations.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
In terms of direction, conflicts are divided into horizontal, vertical and mixed.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
A characteristic feature of vertical and horizontal conflicts

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
is the volume of power that the opponents have

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
at the time of the beginning of the conflict interaction.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
Vertical conflicts imply the distribution of power vertically from top to bottom,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
which determines the different starting conditions of the participants of the conflict.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
The boss is a subordinate, the higher organization is an enterprise,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
the small enterprise is an instigator.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
Horizontal conflicts imply the interaction of subjects

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
of equal volume of power or hierarchical level,

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
leaders of the same level, specialists among themselves, suppliers-consumers.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
Open conflicts are characterized by a clearly expressed collision of opponents.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Quarrels, disputes, military clashes.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
Interaction is regulated by the norms corresponding to the situation

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
and level of the conflict participants.

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
International, in the case of interstate clashes, legal, social, ethical.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
An open conflict arose between the heroes of the case

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
and the master-boss, who you will find in the workbook.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
In a hidden conflict, there are no external aggressive actions

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
between the conflicting parties,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
but indirect methods of interaction are used.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
This happens on the condition that one of the participants of the conflict interaction

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
is afraid of another, or he does not have enough power and strength for an open fight.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
The most common conflicts are vertical and mixed.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
They are on average 70-80% of all others.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
The division of conflicts into types is quite conditional.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
There is no rigid border between different types,

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
and in practice there are conflicts of organizational, vertical, interpersonal,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
horizontal, open, intergroup, and so on.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
Conflicts differ in their importance for the organization,

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
as well as the method of their resolution.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Constructive and destructive conflicts are different.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
A functional or constructive conflict leads to positive consequences

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
for individuals, groups, or organizations.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
A conflict is able to identify a problem,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
and this makes its solution possible.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Due to a conflict, all possible solutions to the problem

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
can be carefully considered,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
as well as a revision,

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
which guarantees the accuracy of the plan.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
A conflict can increase the amount of information

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
used to make a decision.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
Moreover, it offers new opportunities for creative execution

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
of the work of an individual, a group of people, or the whole organization.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
A constructive conflict is useful in situations

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
when a sense of satisfaction with the current situation

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
slows down the necessary changes and evolution.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
A dysfunctional or destructive conflict

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
leads to losses at the level of an individual, group, or organization.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Energy is spent on it in vain.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
It violates the unity of the group,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
generates enmity between people,

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
and creates a general negative atmosphere at work.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
This happens, for example, when two employees are not able to work side by side

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
due to interpersonal differences.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
This is a destructive emotional conflict.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Or when they are unable to act

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
due to the fact that they cannot reach an agreement

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
on the goals of their group.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
This is a destructive significant conflict.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Destructive conflicts of this type

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
can reduce the productivity of work

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
and the sense of satisfaction from the work,

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
contribute to the increase of work hours and the flow of personnel.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
The consequences of conflicts can be functional and dysfunctional.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
The following consequences relate to the functional consequences of a conflict.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
The first problem can be solved in a way

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
that is acceptable to all parties.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
As a result, people will feel their involvement in solving the problem,

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
which is a motivating factor.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
This will help to eliminate or reduce

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
the difficulty in making decisions.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
The second functional positive consequence

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
can be that parties will be more open to cooperation,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
and not to antagonism in future situations,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
fraught with conflicts.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
The conflict can also reduce the possibility of a syndrome of obedience,

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
when employees do not express ideas

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
that, as they believe, contradict the opinion of the boss.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
This leads to an improvement in the process of making decisions.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And finally, through a conflict,

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
members of the group can work out possible problems in execution

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
even before the decision is made.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Let's talk about the dysfunctional consequences of a conflict.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
First of all, this is dissatisfaction,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
a bad state of mind,

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
an increase in the flow of personnel and a decrease in productivity.

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
A dysfunctional conflict can lead to less cooperation in the future.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Strong loyalty to one group

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
and more unproductive competition with other groups

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
are also the dysfunctional consequences of a conflict.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
An idea of the other side as an enemy,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
an idea of â€‹â€‹one's goals as positive,

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
and of the goals of the other side as negative

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
can also have a negative impact on the fulfillment of one's duties.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
The collapse of the interaction and communication between the conflicting parties

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
are also the dysfunctional consequences of a conflict.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
Increasing hostility between the conflicting parties

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
as the interaction and communication decrease,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
shifting the focus,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
that is, giving more importance to victory in a conflict

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
than to solving real problems,

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
are also the dysfunctional consequences of a conflict.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
Correct regulation of a conflict leads to functional consequences,

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
and if you do not find an effective way to manage a conflict,

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
dysfunctional consequences can occur,

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
that is, conditions that interfere with the achievement of goals.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
During the implementation of the practical task number 1,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
answer the questions of the test

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
and determine your behavior strategy in conflict situations.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
How to manage a conflict?

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
The second topic of our meeting is the management of a conflict.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Let's define it.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
Management of a conflict is a purposeful impact

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
on eliminating the causes of the conflict

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
or on the correction of the behavior of its participants.

35:06.000 --> 35:12.000
The main goal is to achieve the stage of true resolution of the conflict,

35:12.000 --> 35:18.000
that is, the situation in which the deep causes of a specific destructive conflict are eliminated.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
This process begins with a clear understanding of the causes

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
and the definition of the evolutionary stage of the conflict.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
The stages of the conflict are shown in the following slide.

35:30.000 --> 35:36.000
The prerequisites of a conflict create conditions for the high probability of its occurrence.

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
When these prerequisites become the basis for a significant or emotional conflict

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
between people or groups, the stage of perceived conflict comes.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
Of course, the perception can be marked only on one of the conflicting sides.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
It is very important to distinguish between perceived and perceived conflicts.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
When a conflict is felt, a person experiences tension,

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
pushing him to take actions aimed at reducing discomfort.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
In order to resolve the conflict, all parties must perceive it

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
and feel the need to do something.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
When a conflict is openly expressed in behavior, it is called a manifestation of a conflict.

36:21.000 --> 36:28.000
The state of the manifested conflict can be resolved by eliminating or correcting its prerequisites.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
The conflict can also be suppressed.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
Suppression of a conflict does not affect the prerequisites of a conflict

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
and is controlled only by the manifestation of conflict behavior.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Methods of resolving conflicts.

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
Among the controlling influences on the conflict, the central place is its resolution.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Not all conflicts can be prevented,

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
so it is very important to be able to get out of a conflict.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
Resolution of a conflict is a joint activity of its participants

37:04.000 --> 37:10.000
aimed at stopping the conflict and solving the problem that led to the collision.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
Resolution of a conflict involves the activity of both sides

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
in transforming the conditions in which they interact,

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
by eliminating the causes of the conflict.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
To resolve a conflict, it is necessary to change the opponents themselves,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
their positions that they defended in the conflict.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
Often, the resolution of a conflict is based on changing the attitude of the opponents

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
to its object or each other.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Resolution of a conflict is a multistage process

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
that includes analysis and assessment of the situation,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
choosing a method of resolving a conflict,

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
forming an action plan, its implementation,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
and assessment of the effectiveness of its actions.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
indirect methods of resolving conflicts are characterized by the fact

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
that they exclude direct interaction with the Personality.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
These methods of influence are mainly on organizational conflicts

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
arising due to the wrong distribution of powers,

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
organization of labor, and the adopted system of stimulation.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Explanation of the requirements for work

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
is one of the best methods of managing dysfunctional conflicts.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
Here, the level of results, sources of information,

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
and the system of powers and responsibilities should be mentioned.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Politics, procedures, and rules are defined.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
Reducing the interdependence of individuals and working units.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
One of the simplest ways is the separation,

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
which is aimed at stopping or reducing the frequency of contacts

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
between conflicting parties.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
Conflicting units can be divided

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
and each of them can have a separate access to valuable resources.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
Although the separation can reduce the intensity of the conflict,

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
it can lead to duplication of efforts

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
and to irrational distribution of valuable resources.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
The second method is the creation of a buffer.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
It can be used in cases when the input resources of one group

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
are the end product of another.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
The classic technique of creating a buffer

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
involves the accumulation of commodity-material reserves, or a buffer,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
between two groups to such an extent

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
that any excess or deficiency of the end product

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
is absorbed by this buffer

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
and does not directly affect the conflicting group.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
Although this technique significantly reduces the conflict,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
its broad implementation is prevented by the fact

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
that it increases the cost of commodity-material reserves.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
This goes against the principle of delivery on time,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
which is highly appreciated by the operational management today.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
Preventing general goals allows to focus the attention

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
of potentially conflicting parties to the achievement of the desired result

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
for both parties.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Effective achievement of complex goals

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
requires joint efforts of two or more employees,

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
so setting such goals, which are common for all employees,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
can serve as a method of preventing conflict.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
For example, if three shifts of the production department

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
conflict with each other,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
then the goals should be formulated for the entire department,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and not for each shift separately.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
Similarly, setting clearly formulated goals of all organizations in general

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
will also contribute to the fact that the managers of departments

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
will make decisions that benefit all organizations,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
and not only their functional area.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
Hierarchy links allow to use a chain of instances

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
to solve the conflict.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
In this case, the solution of the problem is simply passed up

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
the service ladder to senior managers.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
Although a link to the hierarchy can have a key impact

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
in a specific case, this method also has its limitations.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
If the conflict has a heavy and repetitive nature,

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
constant use of links to the hierarchy

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
may not lead to a final solution of the conflict.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
Managers may not always recognize the true causes of the conflict

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
and tend to consider the majority of conflicts

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
as a result of bad interpersonal interactions.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
Another method of changing myths and scenarios.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
In some situations, it is possible to cope with a conflict

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
with the help of a scenario or routine behavior,

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
which becomes a part of the organizational culture.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
Scenarios become rituals that allow conflicting parties

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
to release the accumulated tension

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
and at the same time realize their interdependence

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
within the framework of the whole organization.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
As an example, we can give a monthly meeting

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
of the managers of departments,

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
which is held to coordinate and solve the emerging problems.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
But in fact, it is a kind of forum

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
for reaching an external agreement.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
A well-thought-out reward system structure.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
The system of material and non-material rewards

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
can both contribute to the emergence of conflicts

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
and reduce the possibility of their emergence.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
The reward system should be organized in such a way

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
as to encourage those employees,

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
whose actions contribute to the implementation of general organizational goals,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
to try to solve problems in a complex way.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
On the contrary, the reward system should not encourage employees

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
who are trying to solve narrow problems

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
at the expense of other departments and units.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
For example, it should not encourage employees

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
to do a lot for increasing sales volume,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
if they have achieved this by providing the buyers

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
with a wide range of discounts to the damage of the company's total profit.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
Let's talk about direct methods of managing conflicts.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
The following slide shows 5 ways to manage conflicts,

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
emphasizing cooperation or persistence in relationships.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
As a rule, the true resolution of a conflict can only occur

43:27.000 --> 43:34.000
when it is possible to identify the deep, significant and emotional reasons for the conflict

43:35.000 --> 43:42.000
and find a solution that will allow all conflicting parties to remain in the game.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
A conflict of the type of loss-loss

43:46.000 --> 43:51.000
takes place in cases when no one gets what they want.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
The deep reasons for such a conflict remain untouched,

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
so in the future there is a very high probability of an analogous conflict.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
Persistence is almost not used in its resolution,

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
and the management of conflict resolution takes the following forms.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
Avoidance, that is, a person simply pretends that there is no conflict

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
and that everything will be fine.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Accommodation, or as it is sometimes called adaptation,

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
includes reducing the difference between conflicting parties

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
and highlighting the similarity between them and the sphere of possible agreement.

44:33.000 --> 44:39.000
Such a peaceful coexistence ignores the true essence of this conflict

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
and often leads to frustration and indignation.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
We talk about compromise when each party sacrifices something in favor of another.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
Since as a result no one gets everything he wants,

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
there are still prerequisites for conflicts in the future.

44:59.000 --> 45:05.000
A conflict of the type of win-lose also deserves our attention.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
In the process of such a conflict,

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
one of the conflicting parties achieves what it wants at the expense of the other party,

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
while the desire of the latter is ignored.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
This is a situation characterized by a high level of persistence

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
and a low level of cooperation.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
It can be a result of open competition,

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
in which one of the parties achieves victory

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
at the expense of strength, superiority and domination,

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
or as a result of authoritarian governance,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
when the formal power dictates the decision,

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
indicating who will be the winner and who will be the winner.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
The causes of the conflict are not eliminated,

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
and there is a very high probability of a similar conflict in the future.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
A conflict of the type of win-win is characterized by a combination of persistence

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
and high level of cooperation.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
Cooperation or solving a problem implies recognizing the fact

46:07.000 --> 46:13.000
that all conflicting parties made some mistakes that need to be corrected.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
After collecting and processing information,

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
a decision is chosen in the process of discussions.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
Such a situation eliminates the causes of the conflict,

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
since there is neither avoidance nor suppression.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
All these conflicting parties should see

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
that the decision corresponds to the goals of each of the parties,

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
it is acceptable for both conflicting parties.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
It starts a process in which all interested parties

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
openly and honestly take responsibility for the facts and feelings.

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
Achieving such success means achieving a true resolution of the conflict.

46:55.000 --> 47:02.000
The solution of the conflict is to solve it.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
Get acquainted with the conflict situation that has arisen in the audit firm

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
and answer the questions of the case using the materials of our lecture.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
The next topic is negotiations.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
As a method of resolving conflicts,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
negotiations are a set of tactical approaches

47:19.000 --> 47:25.000
aimed at finding mutually acceptable solutions for conflicting parties.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
In order for negotiations to become possible,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
certain conditions must be met.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
First, the existence of mutual dependence of parties involved in the conflict.

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
Second, the absence of significant difference in the capabilities of the subjects of the conflict.

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
Third, the compliance of the stages of the development of the conflict with the possibility of negotiations,

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
since it is still early to hold them at some stages, and at some it is already late.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Fourth, participation in the negotiations of parties

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
who can really make decisions in the situation.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
It is believed that negotiations are only feasible with those forces

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
who have power in the situation and can influence the outcome of the event.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
It is possible to select several groups whose interests are involved in the conflict.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Primary groups, their personal interests are affected.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
They participate in the conflict themselves,

48:22.000 --> 48:28.000
but the possibility of successful negotiations does not always depend on these groups.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Secondary groups. Their interests are affected,

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
but these forces do not strive for an open manifestation of their interest.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
Their actions are hidden until a certain time.

48:40.000 --> 48:48.000
There may also be third forces, also interested in the conflict, but even more hidden.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
In the negotiation process, it is necessary to consider two important goals.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
One has to do with the essence of the issue, the second with the relationship.

48:57.000 --> 49:04.000
The main goals are related to the results of the negotiations.

49:04.000 --> 49:11.000
One of the examples is the issue of the amount of the salary during the signing of a collective agreement.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
The goals of the relationships are related to the results

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
showing how conscientiously people participate in the negotiation process,

49:21.000 --> 49:29.000
as well as to any consequences that may arise during joint work after the completion of the negotiation process.

49:29.000 --> 49:36.000
As an example, we can give the ability of the members of the Trade Union and representatives of the Administration

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
to work effectively after the completion of disputes on the conclusion of the contract.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Unfortunately, many negotiations lead to the destruction of relations,

49:44.000 --> 49:53.000
because the parties involved are too concerned with the issues related to the essence of the issue and personal interests.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
On the contrary, effective negotiations take place in cases

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
when it is possible to solve issues related to the essence of the issue

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
and at the same time preserve or even improve relations between people.

50:07.000 --> 50:14.000
They lead to the development of common interests and joint decisions for the benefit of all parties.

50:14.000 --> 50:23.000
Managers and group leaders should be ready to negotiate at least in three main situations.

50:23.000 --> 50:30.000
In bilateral negotiations, the manager negotiates directly with another person.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
In group negotiations, the manager is a member of a group

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
in which negotiations are held in order to reach a common solution.

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
In intergroup negotiations, the manager is a member of a group

50:44.000 --> 50:52.000
that negotiates with another group in order to reach a solution to the problem affecting the interests of both groups.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
The strategy of negotiations

50:56.000 --> 51:03.000
The method or strategy of negotiations used can determine their final outcome.

51:03.000 --> 51:11.000
In distributive negotiations, the emphasis is placed on the positions declared by the conflicting parties.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
Each party tries to declare its rights to a part of the pie.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
In integrative negotiations, which are sometimes called principled,

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
the emphasis is placed on the issues of benefit.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
All participants try to increase the size of the pie,

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
and not to take a piece from it.

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
Using a distributive approach to negotiations, participants simply share a certain resource.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
Strict distributive negotiations are characterized by the fact

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
that each party firmly adheres to its position.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
This leads to competition, in which each party strives for domination

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
and tries to satisfy its own interests as much as possible.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
A strict approach can result in a type of win-lose,

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
in which only one party remains in the win.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Otherwise, it can lead to a deadlock.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
Soft distributive negotiations are characterized by the fact

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
that one party is ready to make concessions in order to get something in return.

52:20.000 --> 52:28.000
In this case, one party tries to find a way to satisfy the desire of the other party.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
A soft approach to negotiations leads to accommodation,

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
in which one party concedes to the other,

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
or to a compromise, in which each party sacrifices something in favor of the other

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
in order to achieve an agreement.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
In any case, there is a kind of hidden dissatisfaction.

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
Even if soft distributive negotiations end in a compromise,

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
that is, a rapprochement of the initial positions,

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
there may be a feeling of dissatisfaction,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
since each party did not get what they wanted.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
Using an integrative approach to negotiating,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
participants should ask themselves the question

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
how best to use the available resources.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
This approach implies much less confrontation

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
and allows to consider a wider range of alternatives.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
From the very beginning, they are much more focused on the type of winning-winning.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
The foundation for achieving a truly integrative agreement

53:30.000 --> 53:37.000
is supportive institutions, constructive behavior and good information.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Instances.

53:39.000 --> 53:45.000
There are three instances based on an integrative agreement.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
First, parties should negotiate,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
feeling ready to trust the other party.

53:52.000 --> 53:59.000
That is why ethics and maintaining relations play such an important role in negotiations.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.000
Second, each party should be ready to share information with the other party.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
Without sharing information, it is impossible to effectively solve problems.

54:10.000 --> 54:17.000
Third, participants should demonstrate readiness to ask the other party specific questions.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
This contributes to the exchange of information.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Behavior.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
During negotiations, behavior has a huge impact

54:26.000 --> 54:32.000
both on their outcome and on the overall impression that remains after their completion.

54:33.000 --> 54:38.000
The set of skills and skills required by each participant of the negotiations includes

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
ability to share people and problems,

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
which allows to avoid emotional moments that may influence the course of negotiations,

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
ability to focus on interests, not on positions,

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
ability to refrain from premature judgments,

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
ability to limit the offer of alternatives and their assessment,

55:02.000 --> 55:10.000
ability to judge a possible agreement based on an objective set of criteria or standards.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Information.

55:11.000 --> 55:18.000
Information has a significant impact on the conclusion of an integrative agreement.

55:19.000 --> 55:27.000
It implies that each party is familiar with the NAOS, the best alternative to the agreed agreement.

55:27.000 --> 55:35.000
That is, each party should know what it will do if the agreement is not reached.

55:35.000 --> 55:43.000
This means that each of the negotiating parties needs to identify and understand

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
their personal interests in the situation.

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
They should know what is really important for them,

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
and also understand the importance of the interest of the other party.

55:56.000 --> 56:06.000
This may seem very difficult, but each of the parties should understand the values of the opposite party,

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
as well as determine when it will resort to its NAOS.

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
In the training of negotiations for the illustration of a distributive and integrative approach,

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
I often use a group in which participants are divided into two groups.

56:23.000 --> 56:29.000
The subject of the negotiations is 100 pieces of rare African wood, the whole harvest of this year.

56:29.000 --> 56:35.000
The number of fruits is limited, and participants will not get them anywhere else.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
A separate instruction is prepared for each group.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
The first group is doctors who can prepare a medicine from the seeds of these fruits

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
to treat an epidemic of an unknown disease, which causes the death of small children.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
The second group is scientists who need to extract the pulp of the specified fruits

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
to continue their experience in rejuvenation.

56:57.000 --> 57:03.000
The upcoming negotiations are the only chance to get the fruits they need.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
As a rule, participants get into the most common traps leading to the failure of negotiations.

57:10.000 --> 57:16.000
The first mistake is a tendency to defend their position in the negotiation process,

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
which is based on the assumption that in order to get something,

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
you need to take something away from the opposite side.

57:24.000 --> 57:32.000
This myth of a fixed size of the pie is a purely distributive approach to the negotiation.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
The whole concept of integrative negotiations comes from the assumption

57:37.000 --> 57:45.000
that in some cases the size of the pie can be increased or used with maximum benefit for all parties,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
and not only for one party.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
Secondly, there is a high probability of escalation of participation,

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
since parties often start negotiations with exceeded requirements.

57:57.000 --> 58:04.000
That is, having stated their requirements, people continue to defend them and refuse to go into the trap.

58:04.000 --> 58:11.000
Caring for the protection of one's ego and self-preservation may lead to an escalation of the conflict.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
In order to overcome this tendency in people's behavior, a firm self-discipline is required.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
Thirdly, often the participants of the negotiations are too confident

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
that only their position is the only one that is true.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
This can lead to the fact that they ignore the needs of the other side.

58:31.000 --> 58:38.000
Sometimes the participants of the negotiations are simply unable to see the fairness of the position of the opposite side,

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
which is thrown into the eyes of the third-party observer.

58:42.000 --> 58:49.000
Fourthly, during negotiations, certain difficulties can be caused by communication problems.

58:50.000 --> 58:57.000
As stated, negotiations are a process of bilateral communication in order to achieve a joint solution.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
This process can be disrupted due to communication problems,

59:02.000 --> 59:09.000
that is, the parties do not actually talk to each other, at least do not try to speak as clearly as possible.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
And this process can be disrupted due to perception problems,

59:14.000 --> 59:22.000
that is, the parties are unable or do not want to hear or understand what the opposite side is saying.

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
It is most likely that positive negotiations will take place in those cases

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
when each of the parties is involved in active listening and asks a lot of questions

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
in order to clarify what exactly the opposite side is saying.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
As a rule, only the analysis of the specified mistakes allows the participants of the game to understand

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
that there is no conflict of interests in this game.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
One group needs seeds, and the other needs to crush the rare fruits.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
Sometimes negotiations can be completed thanks to the interference of the third party,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:06.000
especially if they go into a deadlock and, under the circumstances, the situation becomes insoluble.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000
When arbitration, the third party acts as a judge and has the power to make a decision

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
that is necessary for both conflicting parties.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The decision is made after the arbitrator listens to the positions of both parties involved in the dispute.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.000
When mediating, the neutral third party tries to bring the parties to a decision in the negotiation process

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
using the method of persuasion and reasonable argumentation.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
This is the usual method of resolving labor disputes,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
when in order to bring the negotiations out of a deadlock,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
they turn to specially trained intermediaries, acceptable for both parties.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Unlike the arbitrator, such an intermediary cannot dictate a decision.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Properly organized negotiations go through several stages in sequence.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Preparation for the start of negotiations

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Before any negotiations, it is extremely important to prepare well for them,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
to diagnose the state of affairs,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the conflict participants,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
to predict the distribution of forces,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
to find out who will be negotiating and what interests of which groups he represents.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It is necessary to clearly formulate the goal of participation in negotiations.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
In this regard, we should answer the following questions.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
What is the main goal of the negotiations?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
What alternatives are available?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
If the agreement is not reached, how will this affect the interests of both parties?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
What is the interdependence of the opponents and how does it look like?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Initial choice of position

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Usually, negotiations begin with statements from both sides about their wishes and interests.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
With the help of facts and principled argumentation,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
for example, the task of the company or the common interest,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
the parties try to strengthen their positions.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
If the negotiations are held with the participation of an intermediary, a leader, a negotiator,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
then he must give each party an opportunity to express himself.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
In addition, the leader determines the factors of the deterrence of the parties and manages them.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000
This is the permissible time for discussed issues and the consequences of the inability to compromise.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
He offers ways of making decisions, a simple majority or consensus.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
He also determines procedural issues.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The next stage is the search for a mutually acceptable solution.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
At this stage, the parties check the possibilities of each other,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
how realistic the requirements of each of the parties are and how their implementation

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
may affect the interests of another participant.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Opponents present facts that are only beneficial to them,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
declare whether they have possible alternatives.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Here, various manipulations and psychological pressure on the leader are possible.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Seizing initiatives in all possible ways.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The goal of each of the participants is to achieve balance or slight domination.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The task of the intermediary at this stage is to see and implement possible combinations of the interests of the participants,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
to contribute to the implementation of a large number of solutions,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
to direct negotiations in the search for specific proposals.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000
In case of negotiations, the character of the one of the parties is sharp,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
the leader must find a way out of the created situation, which will lead to satisfaction of both parties.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
The next stage is the completion of negotiations or exit from a dead end.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
At this stage, there are already a significant number of various proposals and options,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
but the agreement on them has not yet been reached.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Time begins to squeeze, tension increases, a decision is required.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Since the last few concessions made by both parties can save the case,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000
it is important for the conflicting parties to clearly understand which concessions do not affect the achievement of their main goal,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
and which ones reduce the previous work to nothing.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Get acquainted with the negotiating tactics and ways to overcome the negotiating dead ends,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
and then answer the questions of the case.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000
The most common and common type of economic conflict is an open refusal of labor by a separate working group,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
that is, a strike.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:15.000
A strike in the broad sense is a collective stoppage of work undertaken in order to put pressure on those

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
who depend on the sale or use of labor products.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
There are a number of features that any strike must include.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
First, the presence of technological consequences.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.000
This is a stoppage of the labor process, which manifests itself in the violation of the flow of materials to the enterprise,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
as well as the flow of goods for consumers.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Second, a refusal to obey.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
A breakdown of the social system, especially its power relations, occurs.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Third, an open expression of aggression, typical for spontaneous strikes.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Such a characteristic of a strike as visibility, entertainment, is particularly highlighted.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It includes a face-to-face relationship between mutually personified antagonists.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
While some forms of conflict, for example, competition for a place in the market,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.000
are so personified that antagonists may not even know each other.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
In other words, unlike many other forms of conflict,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000
a strike is, firstly, an open form of conflict, secondly, personified, and thirdly, mass.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Strikes can be official or unofficial, as well as constitutional or non-constitutional.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Official strikes are considered where the trade union supports its members

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
in accordance with the rules of the trade union during the dispute.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
A constitutional strike is one that takes place after negotiations,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000
following an agreed procedure and in conditions when the inability of the parties to agree is fixed.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000
The attitude of a strike to official or unofficial depends on who led it.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Unofficial is a strike that is not recognized by the executive committee of the trade union.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:25.000
However, the peculiarity is that often strikes, starting as spontaneous or unofficial,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
turn into official ones, being led by the trade union's governing bodies.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
There are 9 reasons for a strike.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
1. Demands to increase the salary.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
2. Other disputes related to the payment of labor.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
3. Working hours.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
4. Restrictive disputes.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
5. Occupation and questions of dismissal.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
6. Other personal issues.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
7. Other agreements and working rules.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
8. Discipline.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
9. Status of the trade union.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
10. Support actions.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Only 4 of these reasons for a strike always give noticeable numbers.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000
These are disputes on labor payment, employment and dismissal issues, and other working agreements.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.000
The other 5 categories give together only 10-15% of production stops.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
In general, we can talk about 4 types of reasons for a strike.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
1. Economic.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
2. Ideological.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
3. Political.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
4. Psychological.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The consequences of strikes can only be partially assessed in economic terms.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
The next topic is organizational stress.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Organizational stress is a mental stress associated with overcoming the imperfection of organizational labor conditions,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:59.000
with high loads when performing professional duties at work in a specific organizational structure,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
as well as with the search for new, extraordinary solutions in force-majeure circumstances.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Organizational stress is caused by three levels of internal organizational factors.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
1. Individual characteristics of the staff.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
2. Group interaction.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
3. Organizational environment.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
4. External or macro-medium stress factors.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000
In other words, organizational stress is manifested in the tension of the adaptation mechanisms of the personality

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
in response to a certain organizational-productive situation.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Organizational stress is also associated with role conflicts, high professional requirements,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:51.000
extreme conditions of activity for certain professions, for example, pilots, astronauts, dispatchers.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000
The main reason for organizational stress is the presence of an internal conflict

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
between the requirements on the part of the organization, the attractiveness of work in it,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
expectations and real capabilities of the employee himself.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
The inconsistency between the personality and the organizational environment can manifest itself at several levels

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
â€“ subjective, behavioral, cognitive, physiological and organizational.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The following reasons for organizational stress are highlighted.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
1. A violation of the sense of comfort and safety of labor.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
2. A lack of time to complete planned tasks.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
3. Difficult and previously unknown production tasks.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
4. Conflicts with the superior manager, with subordinates.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
5. Loss of authority and managing influence on the team.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
6. Long work without rest, overwork.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
7. Unfair punishments.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
7. Undeserved condemnation or passionate criticism.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
8. Loss of reward.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:14.000
A special category is the factor of high personal responsibility for colleagues and subordinates, for the common cause.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000
People with high responsibility are more likely to be subject to the development of organizational stress

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
and the syndrome of emotional burnout.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The factors of organizational stress are also excluded from active participation in decision-making.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
If employees do not have the opportunity to influence important events related to their work,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000
they experience a sense of helplessness and loss of control over the situation.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.000
This leads to the development of dissatisfaction with self-realization and quality of life

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and, as a result, to a decrease in confidence in professional self-efficacy.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
The negative consequences of organizational stress are

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
a decrease in work motivation and willpower,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
a stagnation of personnel,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
an increase in the number of unfortunate cases in production,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
an increase in conflict in the team,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
a decrease in productivity,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
a feeling of depression and overwork,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
a feeling of loneliness and dissatisfaction with life,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
and many other complex experiences called stress syndromes.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
The consequence of long-term organizational stress can be professional burnout.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
The higher the attractiveness of work in a given organization,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
the greater the confidence in career growth or stability

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and satisfaction with professional self-realization and quality of life,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
which is provided by work,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
the less likely the organizational stress will be.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Since the early 90s of the last century,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000
stress at work has become one of the most relevant production problems related to health,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000
and employers must take the initiative in solving problems related to stress.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
As the seriousness of this problem increases,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
the main task of industrial and organizational psychologists

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
is to create healthy jobs.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
How to eliminate the negative consequences of stress related to work?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.000
First, you can reduce the intensity and number of stressors in the production environment.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Many production stressors are generated by the decisions

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
that are made in relation to selection and placement of personnel,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
training, planning of work and creating certain working conditions.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
These decisions can be made to reduce stress.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Secondly, you can take some action to change the assessment of the situation of people who have encountered stress.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
For example, reorganization of production can be a strong stressor,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
but this stress is largely due to fear of the unknown.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
If you warn workers in advance,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
and also explain in as much detail as possible how their future changes will affect them,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
then such actions can eliminate or reduce their fear.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
You can also use the support programs of workers,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
which make books, resources, courses or consultations available to them,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
to help people learn to assess potential stress situations more objectively.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Thirdly, you can take measures to improve people's ability to effectively cope with the consequences of stress.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It is well recommended to do sports, weight control,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
smoking cessation and other health programs.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Two cases were given in the practical task,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
published not so long ago in Harvard Business Review Russia.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Get to know them and offer your solutions to conflict situations.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Our last topic is the functions and effectiveness of conflict.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
The functions of conflict are considered to be

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
1. Group formation

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
2. Establishment and maintenance of normative and physical boundaries

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.000
3. Establishment and maintenance of a relatively stable structure of inter-group and inter-group relations

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
4. Integration and identification

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
5. Socialization and adaptation of both individuals and groups

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
6. Obtaining information about the surrounding social environment

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:54.000
7. Creation and maintenance of the balance of power, in particular, power, as well as social control

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
8. Normativity

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
The special interest is presented by the functions of conflict,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
which are organically associated with the main feature of the production organization.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
The central features of the production organization and all its units are

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
external purpose and formal institutionalization.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.000
It is these features that determine the leading function of organizational conflict.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000
An organization as a tool is an analogue of a fertilized work,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and an organization as a subject embodies a living labor.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Therefore, the functions of conflict interaction

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
make sense to consider from the point of view of the subject

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:47.000
for whom this organization is primarily an organizational tool of his own activity.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Such a subject can be an owner of the enterprise or a group of supporters of the main part of the stock.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:04.000
It should be said right away that, firstly, not every superior organization can be a subject in relation to this.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Secondly, such an organization may not be unique.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Thus, each of them is a subject of activity for this organization in various areas

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000
in supply and sale, in financial operations, in interaction with partners.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Each of such organizations, which is a full or private functional subject for this,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
we will call a super-organization.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.000
From this point of view, every organization is simultaneously a super-organization

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:48.000
for its relatively independent units that perform the functions of its tool.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
A super-organization, according to its formal status,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
should be located outside and over conflicting organizational structures,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
and, therefore, not to take part directly in the conflict.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Often, in practice, the opposite is observed.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
The super-organization's leader, and therefore the super-organization as a whole,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
is involved in a conflict on the side of one of the opponents.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Such participation equals the actual statuses of the super-organization and its subordinate organization or unit,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
which in any case reveals some dysfunction.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Vertical conflicts, that is, conflicts on the subordinate leader's line,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
perform a diagnostic function for the super-organization.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000
The emergence of a vertical conflict can be a result of dysfunction.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Horizontal conflicts can also be a result of dysfunction,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
or, for example, their basis is the personal qualities of the employee,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
including the super-organization's leaders,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
or specific interpersonal and group interactions,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000
which are not organizational, but develop within the organization.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000
However, a significant part of horizontal conflicts in the organization are not dysfunctional,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
that is, they do not occur due to dysfunction and do not lead to them.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Of course, the diagnosis of dysfunction in the organization is very important,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
but it can be carried out without a conflict.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
A conflict is a sharp manifestation of dysfunction.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
The method of detecting organizational malfunctions,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
designed only for the critical, acute stage of the conflict,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
is hardly a good basis for judging a conflict,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000
and even more so for finding positive or positive properties for the organization in it.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Next, we will turn to only horizontal conflicts,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:55.000
because only they can perform a function for the organization.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:04.000
A conflict is a interaction of objectives and objectives,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
since the formulation of the goal of the organization is done by people.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
A conflict of objectives and objectives is a conflict of possible goals and lines of organization development,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
and the determinants of a conflict are the representation of incompatible goals.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:28.000
But we are not talking about the fact that all future states are more progressive than the present ones.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000
For example, the organization can set its main goal of preserving the existing state

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
regardless of its public assessment or objective progressiveness.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:46.000
The fact that the conflict interactions of subordinates of the organization or units,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
which are partial goals and objectives of their activities,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
are an indicator not only of the pre-existing history of developed dysfunctions,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
but also of what can happen in the future with goals, organizations,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000
and individual parts with funds and other components of activities.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
The indication of the future is the leading function of the organizational conflict.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
It is convenient to call it a prospective one.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
If the situation is recognized by the leaders of the organization,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
and if they have the necessary organizational funds,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:34.000
these leaders get the opportunity to manage the conflict or conflict situations,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:41.000
which will ensure the movement of subordinates of the organization and units in the right direction.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The proclamation of the prospective function of the organizational conflict as a leader

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.000
and recognition of the possibility of managing conflict interactions from the side of the superorganization

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:01.000
with the help of organizational funds will give the basis for the disclosure of other functions of the organizational conflict

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
associated with this main one.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Firstly, the conflict allows to see not only the possible future of the organization,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
but also the ways of achieving it both in the consciousness of people

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.000
and in the objectively existing environment, both physical and organizational.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Secondly, the organizational conflict itself is a direct creator of the future

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
and, first of all, of organizational norms.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Here also join the socializing and adaptation functions of the conflict.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Thirdly, since the prospective function separates the future from the present,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:46.000
it makes the organizational conflict the destroyer of the existing organizational reality,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
that is, the existing organizational relations, norms and values.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.000
In this quality, regardless of the benefits that the conflict will entail in the future,

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
it causes negative attitude of the overwhelming majority of people

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
who are under the threat of its destructive effects.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
It is the destructive properties, destructive abilities of the conflict

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000
that make the attempt to determine the universal effectiveness of the conflict meaningless,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
regardless of the opponents and the superorganization.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
The victory in the conflict of one of the opponents

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
always makes the interaction ineffective for the other.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:36.000
In general, it doesn't matter which of the subordinates of the organization or units

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
will win in the conflict.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
From the organizational point of view, the outcome that leads to the achievement of its goals

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
and to the increase of the effectiveness of its activities.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Therefore, the determination of the effectiveness of the conflict is situational in its nature

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000
and makes sense only in relation to a specific interaction.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Thus, the belief of many leaders is that the conflict in the production team

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
must be extinguished, that the work is going better

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
and that the better the less conflicts in the organization,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
it has only an emotional basis.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And in conclusion, I would like to say the following.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Changing your attitude to conflicts practically means changing your views on life.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Try to look at conflicts in a new way,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000
and you will be able to confidently and even creatively find a way out of them.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
A view of a problem, including a conflict, as something positive,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
can be useful.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000
It is able to transform your thinking and help you find a solution in any governance situation.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Good luck!
