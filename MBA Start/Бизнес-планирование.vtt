00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, dear listeners.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
We will consider a short business planning course with you.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
My name is Alexey Nemtinov.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
I work at the British Higher School of Design in Moscow.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
The total work experience in the field of higher and postgraduate education is more than 7 years.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
I have two diplomas, a Russian diploma of an engineer-builder and a diploma of an organization manager.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
And one foreign diploma, a master's dissertation,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
defended at the Columbia University of Missouri, USA,

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
on the specialization of education management and analysis of educational policy.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I also have a rich experience of working in business.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
From 1994 to 2000 I worked as a director of the Nizhny Novgorod representative of the Italian company Marazzi,

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
which produces ceramic tiles.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
From 2000 to 2002 I worked as a co-founder and general director of the Nizhny Novgorod commercial company Delta 2000.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
And in 2004-2005 I worked as a consultant researcher at the Center for Small Business Development in Columbia, USA.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I would like to start with a brief history of the creation of this course.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
The basis of the course is a business plan used by the Center for Small Business Development in Columbia, USA,

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
to train American entrepreneurs, owners of their own business, to business planning skills.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
This business plan has been successfully used by local entrepreneurs working in the construction industry for many years.

01:44.000 --> 01:54.000
Since 2005, the course is constantly being revised and edited for small and medium-sized enterprises.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
In this regard, I would be very grateful for any feedback and recommendations on improving the course.

02:01.000 --> 02:11.000
Let's briefly focus on the purpose of studying the course and what knowledge, skills and skills should be acquired to complete the course.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
First, you need to learn to formulate your business idea in a short and clear way.

02:19.000 --> 02:31.000
And secondly, you need to learn to express this business idea and its implementation plan on a computer screen and on paper.

02:31.000 --> 02:50.000
When you learn this, you will use the business plan you have created as your instruction for where you are going when you have any questions.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Let's look at the screen at the purpose of studying our course from a theoretical point of view,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
and how it sounds from a methodological point of view.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
The purpose of studying the course is to learn to formulate a business plan for enterprises operating in the field of small and medium-sized businesses.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Upon completion of the course, you should have acquired the knowledge of the content and purpose of the main sections of the business plan,

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
the ability to apply the knowledge gained in practice, and the skills of writing a business plan for the activities of a particular enterprise.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Now let's briefly look at the content of our video lecture.

03:29.000 --> 03:39.000
The video lecture opens with the purpose and main goals of the business plan, and then we will look at the seven sections of which this video lecture consists.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
The first section is called the introductory part and reflects the introductory part of the business plan that we are going to write.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
Like all other sections, the introductory part consists of methodological instructions, examples and so-called useful tips.

03:53.000 --> 04:04.000
These useful tips are collected from various sources, and they include the advice of professionals who wrote a business plan for enterprises of small and medium-sized businesses.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
At the end of this part, we will perform a control task, which is the introductory part.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
The second section is the essence of the project. This is already a section of the business plan itself, this is not the introductory part, this is already the essence of the project.

04:17.000 --> 04:26.000
As in the first part, there will be methodological instructions, examples, useful advice, advice from professionals, and we will perform two control tasks.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
One is called the enterprise mission, the other is the enterprise description.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
The next section that we will consider is called the market.

04:33.000 --> 04:43.000
Here we will briefly consider the methods of market research, or rather, we will not even consider them, but we will just remember the methods of market research that you have previously studied within other disciplines.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And we will perform the fourth control task, which is called the buyer's portrait.

04:48.000 --> 05:03.000
The next, fourth section is the production plan. Here we will consider the methodology of writing a production plan, we will consider several examples, and also together we will analyze the useful tips that professionals give when writing a production plan.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
The next section is sales and marketing. Here, as in the previous sections, methodological instructions and useful tips are given.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
The sixth section is enterprise management, also methodological instructions, examples, useful tips.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And the seventh section, I would like to dwell on it in particular.

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
This section is called the financial plan, but this section, the financial plan, is considered in detail within other disciplines.

05:28.000 --> 05:44.000
Therefore, we will consider this financial plan only theoretically, we will consider examples of the implementation of these financial plans, we will consider the simplification method of writing a financial plan, we will see how to determine the point of profitability and the coefficient of profitability.

05:44.000 --> 05:59.000
In addition, there is such a section of the business plan, which is called the application. Here you can place any information in this application that you consider inappropriate for the seven specified sections.

05:59.000 --> 06:14.000
Here we have the content of the video lecture, as I said, consists of seven sections, and the seventh section is the financial plan. When you write your business plan, it will be called the business plan of a commercial enterprise, you will also have seven sections.

06:14.000 --> 06:27.000
And they will be called exactly the same, these sections, as we have just voiced the content of the video lecture. The only thing is that the financial plan is not included in this section, and the seventh section that you will have is called the application.

06:27.000 --> 06:44.000
Moreover, this section is not mandatory. If you have any information that you do not want to include in your business plan, include it in the application. If you do not have such information, your business plan will consist of only six sections.

06:44.000 --> 07:07.000
Let's now focus on the purpose and main goals of the business plan. Such a classic definition of a business plan is a brief, accurate, accessible and understandable description of the business or deal. This is a definition that is used in many textbooks and in many guidelines for writing a business plan.

07:08.000 --> 07:21.000
In terms of its value, it is the most important tool when considering various situations. The business plan allows you to choose the most promising solution and determine the means of their achievement.

07:21.000 --> 07:38.000
The business plan performs four functions. These four functions are quite peculiar in terms of the weight of these functions in the Russian and foreign entrepreneurs. Let's first mention these four functions.

07:38.000 --> 07:54.000
The first function is related to the ability to use the business plan to develop a business strategy. The second function is planning. The third function is related to attracting money. And the fourth function is related to attracting companies and potential partners to implement the plan.

07:54.000 --> 08:17.000
For the Russian entrepreneurs, the first function is related to the development of a business strategy. The second function is related to planning. The third function is related to attracting money. And the fourth function is related to attracting potential partners.

08:17.000 --> 08:42.000
In our case, we will focus on the third and fourth functions. We will write a business plan to attract money and potential partners. This is the main goal of writing a business plan.

08:42.000 --> 08:56.000
The first and second functions are important for the Russian entrepreneurs. We will consider the first function as a business plan to develop a business strategy and the second function as planning.

08:56.000 --> 09:18.000
Let's briefly discuss the classification of business plans. There are seven most common business plans on the screen. There are no clean business plans, such as the business plan of the organization or the business plan of the loan application.

09:18.000 --> 09:39.000
All of them are somehow intersected. But if we consider what is important for our course, we will focus on the business plan of the organization, the business plan of the loan application and, perhaps, the business plan of the grant application.

09:40.000 --> 10:00.000
There is also a business plan of the organizational division. We do not mean the business plan of the organizational division. But if we talk about the development of a business, we can consider a new stage of business development as a business plan of the organizational division.

10:01.000 --> 10:17.000
This is the classification of business plans. Now let's look at the structure of the standard business plan and its main sections. We have already discussed that we have seven sections, and the seventh section is either a financial plan or an application.

10:17.000 --> 10:30.000
In addition, there is a standard structure of the business plan in the world practice. Let's look at the screen where the typical structure of the business plan is presented, which includes the following sections.

10:30.000 --> 10:54.000
The first section is the title sheet. The second section is the introductory part, it is also called a summary. The third section is the analysis of the situation in the industry. The fourth section is the essence of the project. The fifth section is the marketing plan. The sixth section is the production plan. The seventh section is the organizational plan. The eighth section is the risk assessment. The ninth section is the financial plan. And the tenth section is the application.

10:54.000 --> 11:09.000
These are all the sections that can be presented in the business plan. There are various modifications of these sections. Our modification is seven sections of the business plan.

11:09.000 --> 11:32.000
I would like to say again about the peculiarities of business planning in Russian specific conditions. This is explained by the specific economic and social situation that does not allow to use foreign methods directly. Therefore, Russian authors often use methods different from the Western methods and approaches to making business plans.

11:33.000 --> 11:45.000
Within the framework of this course, there is no task to consider these methods, so if someone is interested in more details about these methods, they can be found in the corresponding sections of the listed literature.

11:45.000 --> 12:02.000
If you pay attention, then in the list of literature, this literature is marked with numbers 3, 4, 5 and 10. Under these numbers are marked the corresponding sources of literature, where you can familiarize yourself with the methods of writing business plans by Russian entrepreneurs.

12:02.000 --> 12:20.000
The next point is software development and assessment of the efficiency of business plans on the Russian market. In recent years, many domestic software products have appeared, and many of them are of very high quality and can compete with Western software products.

12:20.000 --> 12:37.000
Among these products are Alt-Invest, the developer of which is the research and consulting firm Alt, Teo-Invest, the developer of the Institute of Management Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Project Expert program, the developer of the company Pro-Invest Consulting.

12:37.000 --> 12:50.000
Among these three, another leader stands out, this leader is the Project Expert Professional for Windows. This is an automated system that allows you to model the activity of an enterprise in the conditions of market relations.

12:50.000 --> 13:06.000
As we have already said, in the world practice of entrepreneurship, the main goal of writing a business plan is to attract money and investors. In Russian conditions, emphasis is placed on the development of strategies and planning. The same trend also applies to Project Expert.

13:06.000 --> 13:29.000
Another feature of the Project Expert system is the user privacy. Data is entered in the form of unrelated volumes of information, at the output we get analytical graphs and financial reports. This software is a wonderful tool for the work of financial analysts and other business planning specialists.

13:30.000 --> 13:52.000
Unfortunately, this feature does not allow using this software as a simple and accessible training program. Therefore, be familiar with this program. If someone wants to learn more about it, there is a lot of literature and ready-made packages of Project Expert programs. You can take this program and use it.

13:52.000 --> 14:14.000
In order to work with this program, you need to collect the original data, enter it into this program, and as a result you will receive all sections of your business plan, including the financial section, including financial reports, including analysis and including other schedules. This will be a detailed professional document on making a business plan.

14:15.000 --> 14:37.000
Now let's get back to our course. The course is a simple and accessible business plan. Its brief content, as we have already said, has the following view. This content is presented on the screen. I repeat again, without the seventh section. In the seventh section we had a financial plan. In this case, the seventh section will be an application.

14:37.000 --> 14:59.000
The first is the introductory part, the second is the essence of the project, the third section is the market, the fourth is the production plan, the fifth is the sales and marketing section, the sixth is the management section, and the seventh is the application, which is not required to perform the final work. Your business plan can include only six sections.

15:00.000 --> 15:12.000
As we have already said, the course includes the main part, which consists of the methodology of describing the business plan and useful tips on how to avoid typical mistakes.

15:12.000 --> 15:34.000
We also have a very large package of programs that are included in the application, a package of electronic documents. These applications contain numerous examples of four control tasks for developing skills in writing separate sections and subsections of the business plan, as well as two integral business plans.

15:34.000 --> 16:03.000
One integral business plan is written for the enterprise of the medium business, a society with limited responsibility for blood. This business plan serves as an example of the implementation of control work. You can use it in any case, in any situation. Just take it as an instruction, study its sections, and somewhere in some places it will be like a textbook for you to write a business plan.

16:04.000 --> 16:23.000
The second business plan for a small business enterprise that is not a legal entity is the business plan without a legal entity, Colorit. The business plan Colorit contains characteristic errors with comments and corrections.

16:23.000 --> 16:49.000
As you study the course, as you go through this video course and our communication with you, I will very often refer to these two business plans. There are a lot of examples of how to write a business plan and how not to write a business plan. I repeat again, how not to write a business plan. This is done from the point of view of educational purposes and so that you do not repeat these mistakes.

16:49.000 --> 17:04.000
If you open the application and open this business plan for the Colorit enterprise, the places that are unsuccessful and that are written with errors, they are highlighted either in a different color or they are highlighted in a cursive.

17:04.000 --> 17:32.000
Let's stop at the first part of the business plan, the introductory part. The introductory part of the business plan includes the title sheet, summary and content. The introductory part serves to create the first impression on the reader. After reading the introductory part, the reader will decide whether your business plan is interesting to him or not.

17:32.000 --> 17:52.000
The purpose of the title sheet is to be informative and brief, so only information about your enterprise should be placed on the title sheet. The next section is the summary. The summary should convince the reader that the business plan is a well-thought-out document and its reading will not be a waste of time.

17:52.000 --> 18:11.000
The next section is the content. The content shows how well you have composed the main sections and connected them into one whole. Let's look at each of the business plan sections in more detail.

18:22.000 --> 18:50.000
The title sheet includes the business plan, the company logo, the company address, the telephone number, the fax number, the email address, the project execution date and date. The business plan and the execution of your tasks are displayed in the applications, so you can familiarize yourself in detail with the applications with these documents.

18:51.000 --> 19:12.000
In addition, the application provides two examples. The first example is an example of the execution of your business plan. It is an instruction on how to execute a business plan.

19:12.000 --> 19:30.000
The second example is an example of an enterprise without a legal entity called Colorit. In this example, various errors are intentionally made and recommendations are given on how to eliminate and avoid these errors.

19:30.000 --> 19:50.000
The next section is the summary. The summary is the part of the business plan that most readers begin to familiarize themselves with. Although the business plan is the first page of the business plan, in the practice of entrepreneurship, it is written last.

19:50.000 --> 20:11.000
The summary usually consists of one to three pages of printed text. The business plan is included here, the financial resources and conditions for their provision, the start date of the activity, the current situation, the names of the owners and persons making the main decisions, as well as the results achieved.

20:12.000 --> 20:29.000
What are the tips and recommendations for writing a summary? As we said, the summary is written at the end of all other parts in order to select key points from the main content of the business plan and include them in the summary.

20:29.000 --> 20:47.000
As we have a training course, we will write a summary first. We start with a summary and we will even have a task that includes writing a summary. You write a summary based on the instructions and recommendations that are given in the application.

20:47.000 --> 21:11.000
The next piece of advice is that entrepreneurs who are experienced in writing business plans usually do so. They write a summary and after the summary is written, they give it to specialists and people who do not have the information.

21:11.000 --> 21:33.000
This can be an entrepreneur who is familiar with your business, or a person who does not know anything about your business. After he reads the summary, he should have an idea of what your business plan is and what your business plan conveys to him.

21:33.000 --> 21:48.000
The second point is that you give the business plan to a person who is familiar with your business. Here is the opinion of an expert. If the feedback is positive, then your summary is positive and you can stop writing the summary.

21:48.000 --> 22:15.000
If, as a result of this feedback, you get some negative answers, and the person who read your summary does not give the information that you expected from him, then you need to correct your summary. In any case, the summary should be concise and interesting, and only in this case will the reader have the opportunity to read your entire business plan.

22:15.000 --> 22:34.000
After you have learned the theoretical aspects of writing a summary, please open the e-book and read two examples. One example is to make a summary of an existing business, and the second example is to make a summary of a newly created business.

22:34.000 --> 23:00.000
The last section is the content. The content gives the reader the opportunity to quickly and easily access all sections of your business plan.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
Therefore, all pages of your business plan must be numbered, and the content must include the numbering of pages.

23:09.000 --> 23:27.000
Now it's time to complete the first task. This task includes the title sheet, summary and content. The title sheet is executed without any changes, it is executed in the usual standard form.

23:27.000 --> 23:40.000
As for the summary, it is written in the form of a draft version. Now, until you start writing the entire business plan, it is difficult for you to write a summary. As we have already said, the summary is written last, after the entire business plan is written.

23:40.000 --> 23:58.000
Now you are just creating a draft version, and this draft version will include your ideas for writing a business plan. Do not strive for it to include one page or three pages of printed text. Just look at the task and the task details what questions you need to answer.

23:58.000 --> 24:13.000
Then, during the writing of the rest of the business plan, you will correct your summary. The last one is the content. The content of your business plan at this stage is, of course, without the numbering of pages.

24:13.000 --> 24:28.000
You just list the sections that you will include. The sections that will be included in your task can be seen in the examples and in this control task.

24:43.000 --> 25:00.000
The next section of the business plan is the essence of the project. The essence of the project is already a section of the business plan that includes not superficial acquaintance with the project, its goal is not to interest the reader, but here information is already given on your business plan.

25:00.000 --> 25:23.000
Here you need to present a clear and concise description of the business activity, and this description should be objective and answer the following questions. Who are you? What do you offer? What market needs are you going to satisfy? And why is your business idea viable?

25:24.000 --> 25:43.000
This section consists of five sections. The first section is the analysis of the situation in the industry. The second section is the description of the type of business activity. The next third section is the description of the product or service. The fourth section is the positioning of the enterprise. And the fifth section is the price strategy.

25:43.000 --> 25:58.000
The first section is the analysis of the situation in the industry. What should be reflected here? Here is a brief analysis of the situation in the industry. You do not go into details, you just analyze what is happening in the industry at the moment.

25:58.000 --> 26:23.000
Then you write about the prospects of the market development, what are the trends, what can be expected from the market, and so on. And here you need to specify your role in this market sector. Either you are already working in this market and you are trying to strengthen your sphere of influence, or you are just trying to get into this market.

26:23.000 --> 26:52.000
You reflect your role in this market sector. When writing this section, as well as when writing a summary, use artistic writing style. Explain why certain events occur. In this section, you only need to indicate your competitors. You do not need to discuss competitors. Analysis and discussion of competitors will be done in the next section, which is called the market.

26:52.000 --> 27:21.000
As for the conclusions you make here, all conclusions should be supported by facts with the indication of sources of information. Each person who writes a business plan or a team that writes a business plan always has some subjective opinion, some subjective judgments. In a business plan, these subjective opinions should be absent. If you make a conclusion, specify on what basis you did it and support it with sources of information.

27:22.000 --> 27:42.000
And another piece of advice that should be used is a potential problem. You do not need to hide when you plan your activity that everything will be smooth and there will be no negative moments.

27:42.000 --> 27:56.000
On the contrary, you include these negative moments and give advice and recommendations on what to do to alleviate negative consequences. And again, all this is done in an artistic style.

27:56.000 --> 28:15.000
That is, when a reader gets acquainted with your business plan and sees that you have artistically described these moments and problems and see how to alleviate negative consequences, in the future he will be aware that you have carefully worked out your business plan.

28:15.000 --> 28:28.000
And besides, you worked on how to convey this to the readers and users who will work with your business plan in the future.

28:29.000 --> 28:44.000
The next section is the description of the type of business. The description of the type of business begins with the formulation of the mission in the enterprise. The mission in a concentrated form expresses the meaning of the existence of the company, its purpose.

28:44.000 --> 29:00.000
Unfortunately, the peculiarity of the Russian business is that the mission is not formulated in many enterprises. Many enterprises work and exist, but the mission is absent.

29:00.000 --> 29:16.000
This is a historical fact, a historical event. In the West, on the contrary, any organization, any company begins with the formulation of the meaning of the existence of the company and its purpose.

29:16.000 --> 29:31.000
And when you go to Western enterprises, whether it is a small enterprise or a large enterprise, you can very often meet the mission of the enterprise, highlighted in the form of a poster or in the form of some slogan, and so on.

29:31.000 --> 29:42.000
Therefore, within the framework of our business plan, we will give this meaning and begin to describe the type of business in the enterprise with the formulation of the mission of the enterprise.

29:43.000 --> 30:05.000
In the electronic manual there are examples of writing a mission, examples of writing a mission on the development of software for accounting, the next example on business consulting, the next example on the opening of a new restaurant and the example on the production of educational toys.

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
Please, familiarize yourself with these examples and see how professionals write and formulate the mission of their enterprises.

30:12.000 --> 30:19.000
After you familiarize yourself with the examples, we will perform the next control task, which is called the enterprise mission.

30:20.000 --> 30:28.000
In the control task, it is described in detail how it is performed, the subsequent steps in writing the enterprise mission.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
The only thing I want to warn you about is that writing the enterprise mission is quite a difficult task.

30:34.000 --> 30:51.000
First, you write unrelated, separate proposals, and although, as we said, the enterprise mission is a brief formulation of the purpose and purpose of the enterprise, first you can even write a dozen or even more proposals for which your enterprise exists.

30:52.000 --> 31:05.000
And in the future, you will need to make one or two proposals from these several proposals, from these several quotes, and so on, in which the mission of your enterprise is reflected.

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
All this is described in detail in the task, follow the recommendations that are described in the task in the application.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
After that, you should not have any problems in writing the enterprise mission.

31:21.000 --> 31:28.000
The enterprise mission

31:29.000 --> 31:36.000
After you complete this control task, you need to present the technical aspects.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
The technical aspects should be written in the form of a live and interesting story.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
I will list these aspects now.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Please look at them on the screen.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
This is dry information.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Here is the type of business listed.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
What can it be?

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
Operating or retail trade, product or service production, or this is a new enterprise, or an existing enterprise.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Also, the form of ownership is reflected here.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
Or this is an enterprise without the education of a legal person, or these are some legal organizations.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
Also, the main acting persons who work in this organization are indicated here.

32:16.000 --> 32:24.000
Those persons who may not even work, but are the owners or co-founders of this organization, all of them should be reflected.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
What market needs are you intending to satisfy?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
To whom and how will you sell?

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
And the last point is what auxiliary tools will be used.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
Here can be service maintenance, advertising campaigns, other tools of promotion of a product.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
What tools will you need to specify and think about?

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
As you can see, these are technical aspects, but nevertheless, they should be written in the form of a live and interesting story.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
Here you can do the same as you will do when formulating a mission.

32:56.000 --> 33:07.000
That is, you will first list all these facts, and then try to formulate a live and interesting story from these separate, unrelated facts, and combine them into one whole.

33:08.000 --> 33:15.000
What are the professional advice about writing this section of the business plan?

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Well, the first point is specialization.

33:19.000 --> 33:30.000
If your enterprise is located, for example, in a rural area, you may not specialize and you may offer a wide range of goods.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Let it be, for example, a store that sells food products.

33:35.000 --> 33:45.000
You can sell almost everything in the rural area, and if you have it alone, your range will be in demand from buyers.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
If you work in a large market, then it will require specialization from you.

33:52.000 --> 34:01.000
This is explained by competition, and in this regard, the first advice is to look at how rich your market is, whether you have many competitors.

34:02.000 --> 34:08.000
With high competition, pay attention to specialization, with low competition, be versatile.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
The next piece of advice is the numbers of sales volumes and the profits received over the previous period.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
If you are opening a new enterprise, then this advice is not relevant.

34:24.000 --> 34:35.000
But if you have worked and are simply expanding your business or opening a new direction, be sure to show what you had in previous years and what profit you have received.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
In addition, be sure to indicate the moments when your enterprise was profitable.

34:43.000 --> 34:53.000
If such a fact existed, do not hide this fact, but describe the reasons why the enterprise was profitable and what was done to eliminate these reasons.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
And the last piece of advice is the main actors of the company.

34:59.000 --> 35:07.000
As we said, it can be either people who work in the company or people who do not work in this company, but influence it.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
Do not be too multilingual, but at the same time do not be short.

35:13.000 --> 35:24.000
You need to choose the golden mean and include in the business plan about these people such information that is really useful and that is needed for your business plan.

35:24.000 --> 35:35.000
Now that we have considered the theoretical part, it is time for the next control task, which is called Describe the Enterprise.

35:36.000 --> 35:44.000
The electronic manual has a detailed description of the enterprise. Just follow the points that are indicated.

35:45.000 --> 35:56.000
The question-answer, the question-answer. After you answer all the questions of this task, try to make them in the form of an artistic work.

35:56.000 --> 36:04.000
Now that we have completed three control tasks, I want to remind you that you will have four tasks.

36:05.000 --> 36:16.000
Each of these four tasks will be included in the fifth task, which is the final task.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
The final task should be performed in the form of an artistic story.

36:22.000 --> 36:30.000
For example, the one you have in the application for the enterprise OO Krov.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
See how the final control task is performed.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
The third control task that you will now perform.

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
Try to stick to the artistic style, but nevertheless, if you do not succeed in the artistic style, just put down the facts.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Put down the facts on the description of the enterprise.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
The next section is called Description of the Product and Service.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Describe in detail the products and services that you offer.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Stop how your product or service will be used.

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
Include all the necessary details so that the reader has a complete idea of ​​your products or services.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Here you can find various options for description.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
As an example, consider the description of the service provided by the company that operates in the service sector.

37:26.000 --> 37:33.000
This example in the application for the enterprise OO Krov is called the description of the service provided by the company operating in the service sector.

37:34.000 --> 37:41.000
What are the tips and recommendations for writing this section?

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
First, you must stop at the advantages that exist.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
For example, this is a well-organized service.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Or, for example, we are located in a convenient place for buyers.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Or we trade at the lowest prices, and so on.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
All the advantages that exist, be sure to indicate.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
About the specifications of the product, include as much information as possible.

38:04.000 --> 38:10.000
If you think some information is necessary, but it overloads your business plan and it is excessive, put it in the application.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
If you have the opportunity, include a photo of your product.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
The next tip is about copyright.

38:19.000 --> 38:29.000
Unfortunately, often copied things that are allowed for copying and things that are not allowed for copying.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
But nevertheless, this fact exists.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
And think about what specific features of your product exist.

38:38.000 --> 38:44.000
And think about how you will improve your product so that it retains its uniqueness.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.000
Competitors will follow you and they will do the same if your product is popular.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Think about the tactics of maintaining the uniqueness of your product.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
And the last piece of advice is specific.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Be specific.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
Do not write abstractly, we intend to provide the best service.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
Just explain how you will do it and why your product is the best.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
The next section is called the business positioning.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
Business positioning is a specific feature, a specific parameter.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
The basis of positioning is the image.

39:24.000 --> 39:33.000
The image is what the market participants have when mentioning your business.

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
These are the features of your business on the market,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
the associations that arise when mentioning your product and services.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
If we base our description of the product on its specific features,

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
then the positioning of the enterprise is based on the opinion of the buyers and competitors.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
This is the positioning of the enterprise, this is the image.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
Think about what image you want to create for yourself.

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
How would you like your buyers and competitors to see you and how would they evaluate you?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
What are the tips here?

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
First, to have information, you need to study your competitors.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
There are various ways to study your competitors.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
You can make purchases in their stores, you can call, you can ask,

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
you can send your representatives to their organizations,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
you can consult, you can consult, and so on.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
In any case, you need to study your competitors and collect information about them.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
In order to collect a list of strong and weak sides of competitors,

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
consider such parameters as distribution, prices, service, time.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
Pay attention to the prices offered by competitors.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
What is the reputation of competitors on the market?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
And how often do they conduct inquiries from buyers?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
In addition, take into account the specifics of the business.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
What area do you work in?

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
If you work, for example, in the field of postal services,

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
then prices, ease of documenting,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
delivery speed, the ability to return goods, and so on, will be important for you.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
The next subsection is price policy.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Price policy is a very important section.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
Here you need to describe all the costs

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
from which the price of your product is made.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Describe all these costs, either for your product or for your service,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
and formulate the price, what price you will have.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
In addition, tell me what place your price will take

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
among the prices offered by other suppliers of similar goods and services.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
Here you need to specify, for example, if you have a low price,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
then you do it on purpose, or if you have a high price,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
you also do it on purpose.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
But in any case, this must be explained,

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
and in any case, your place among your competitors must be specified.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
In addition, it is imperative to specify

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
how your price will affect the adoption of the product by the market.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
How your market will grow in the competitive environment,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
and what profit will be obtained.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Useful tips.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
First, when writing business plans,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
there is often such a mistake, it is price reduction.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Do not reduce the costs in order to set a low price.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
You will lose your maneuver, and in the future it will be very difficult for you to increase prices.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
It is better to initially set a high price, and then reduce it.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
But it will be much more difficult to set a low price and then raise it.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
The next point.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
If you set a price higher than the competitors, it must be justified.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
On what basis are you doing this?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Or is it due to the import of the product,

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
high quality, high warranty obligations, service maintenance, and so on.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
For the reader who will read your business plan, this is very important.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
If there is a high price, there must be a justification for this high price.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
And vice versa.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
If you have a low price, the reader will be interested in why the price is low, what happened.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
You also need to justify how you make a profit.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Why is your price lower than the price of competitors?

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
Another useful tip is how high prices reduce volume.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
You can reduce the volume, but make more profit at high prices.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
But again, this can only be done in low competition.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
If the competition is high, and if, as we said, your product, your service requires concentration,

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
requires concentration of efforts, requires concentration of resources,

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
here, of course, we should not talk about high prices.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Market

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
The next section we are going to discuss is called the market.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
The market uses the tools of analysis that you have already studied.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
They are familiar to you from the modules of general marketing and strategic management.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Let's briefly explain what these tools are.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
The first is the Michael Porter model, with the allocation of five competitive forces that determine the profitability of the industry.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
The second method is the PEST analysis.

44:34.000 --> 44:40.000
It is designed to identify political, economic, social and technological aspects of the external environment

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
that can affect the strategy of the company.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Sometimes it is called PEST analysis,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
that is, so many political, economic, social and technological aspects of the external environment are considered here.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Sometimes this analysis is made more extensive.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
Here we also study legal factors and environmental protection factors.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
In addition, there is another tool called SWOT analysis.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
This is a very common methodology in the West,

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
which considers the strengths and weaknesses of the company,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
the opportunities for the company and the threats that exist.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Here, external and internal environment components are studied.

45:19.000 --> 45:28.000
These are the tools that are used to make detailed business plans,

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
when describing this section of the market.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Within this course, we use a simplified methodology for market research,

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
and we will consider a slightly different sequence,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
a slightly different method of describing this section.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
There are four sections here.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
The first section is called buyers.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
The second section is called the size of the market and its trends.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
The third section is competition.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
And the fourth section is called the predicted volume of sales.

46:01.000 --> 46:07.000
The main task of this section is not to make a detailed market analysis,

46:08.000 --> 46:15.000
but to use factors to convince an investor or potential partner

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
or another reader who will read your business plan,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
that your business plan has enough clients

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
and is able to provide the necessary volume of sales.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Here you need to create a detailed portrait of the buyers

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
on whom your product is aimed.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
To create a detailed portrait of the buyer,

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
you choose an ordinary client and specify his distinctive features.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
For example, small restaurant clients can be private entrepreneurs

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
engaged in organizing and holding weddings or other similar celebrations.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
Business clients engaged in selling cars

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
can be car repair and maintenance workshops.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
This is how buyers are described.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
It is important to create detailed information about your client.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
What useful tips are there?

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
First, you can narrow the circle of your clients,

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
indicating those you would not like to see among your buyers.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
A experienced seller, for example, will not serve retail buyers.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
The next tip is too abstract description.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Be specific and detailed.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
A typical mistake is to write, for example,

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
people who want to buy bicycles or someone who wants to write a resume.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Be more detailed.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Indicate that among these people who want to buy bicycles

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
it will be either expensive bicycles or cheap bicycles

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
or sports bicycles, etc.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Be more detailed.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
The next tip is to include a geographical market parameter in the description.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It can be an international market,

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
or a domestic market,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
or a regional market,

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
or a local market.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
The next tip is not to use professional jargon.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
If it is a professional jargon and you need it,

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
and you want to include it,

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
then define those incomprehensible terms that you will use.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
Now, after we have considered this section of the market,

48:26.000 --> 48:34.000
I repeat once again that we describe it not in the form of a market analysis,

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
but in the form of a detailed portrait of your clients, your buyers.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
We will perform the last control task,

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
which is called the buyer's portrait.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
Here I want to focus on the tasks that we have performed so far.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
We have performed four tasks.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
These tasks were the introductory tasks,

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
when you wrote a summary,

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
made up a title sheet,

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
and wrote a content.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
The next was the enterprise mission

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
and the description of the product.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Now, the moment of the fourth control task has come,

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
which is called the buyer's portrait.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
All these four tasks that we have performed so far

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
were dry tasks where you listed the facts

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
and followed the instructions.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I told you that when performing these tasks,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
you can use the artistic style of writing,

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
try to use the artistic style of writing.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
For example, when we talked about the summary,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
we talked about the fact that you perform the summary in the form of a draft,

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
and then you will return to it again.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
At the moment, you have completed all these tasks,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
and now we will talk a little about the fifth,

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
about the last task.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
The last task is separate,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
because the last task includes the four previous tasks.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
But you do not transfer these four previous tasks mechanically

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
to the fifth task,

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
but you make up an artistic description.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
And this is just the moment

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
when you need to switch from the detailed descriptions

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
that you have made in these tasks from 1 to 4

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
and get the final result.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
And get the picture,

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
and get the business plan,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
get the characteristics of your business plan

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
in the form of an artistic description.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
All your characteristics are no longer dry,

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
not numbers,

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
but they become connected sentences

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
in the form of an artistic story.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
This is the fourth task.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Let's assume that at the moment

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
we stopped at these drafts,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
and now, when we talk about the next,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
about the next sections of the business plan,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
we will talk about the fifth control task,

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
where you include all descriptions

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
in the form of an artistic story.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
And besides this,

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
in the electronic aid,

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
I have already talked about this,

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
there are two examples.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
One example is a society

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
with a limited responsibility for blood,

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
where, let's say,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
this final task is written

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
for an excellent rating,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
which should be seen as an example for writing.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
When you will compose your final task

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
from these four tasks,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
add something from other sections,

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
look at this society

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
with a limited responsibility for blood.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
In this society with a limited responsibility for blood

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
a business plan for an enterprise is given,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
which worked on the Nizhny Novgorod market,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
on the Nizhny Novgorod market of building materials.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And the dry facts,

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
which were inherent in any enterprise,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
they were interpreted, adapted,

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
as you like,

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
in the form of a connected and interesting story

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
about this enterprise.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
When you read this example,

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
there is a desire to read it further and further,

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
due to the fact that this example

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
is processed in such a way

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
that it is not a fiction.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
The second example I told you about

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
is an example of writing a business plan

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
for an enterprise without the education

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
of a legal person, Koloriv.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Mistakes are deliberately made there,

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
we have already talked about this with you,

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
and in some places

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
a dry description is given,

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
facts that are not connected with each other are given.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
When you will write your final task,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
look at these two examples

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
and follow the first example

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
of a society with limited responsibility for roofing

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
and avoid writing a business plan

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
according to the scenario

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
that was used when writing a business plan

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
for an enterprise without the education

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
of a legal person, Koloriv.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
And one more difference

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
between these two enterprises.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
If an enterprise without the education

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
of a legal person

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
is a small business enterprise,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
then a society with limited responsibility for roofing

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
is a medium-sized business enterprise.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Therefore, look at

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
who will describe which organization,

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
explore the parameters,

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
the points that are given

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
for an enterprise of a medium-sized business

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
or for an enterprise of a small business.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
The size of the market and its trends.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Here you need to describe the overall size of the market

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
and the sector in which your business will develop.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Statistical data is studied here,

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
information is given

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
about the successfully functioning sectors of the market

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
at the present time

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
for forecasting future trends of development.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
In addition, you need to describe the target market.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Geographical data,

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
the size of the company,

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
lifestyle, gender, age,

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
gender and other data

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
are used here to describe the characteristics of the organization

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
and individual clients

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
who will buy your product.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
When you describe the characteristics of the organization

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
and individual clients

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
who will buy your product,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
when you describe this section of the business plan,

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
decide who your clients are.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Either these are organizations,

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
legal entities

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
or private clients.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Please open the e-mail

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
and familiarize yourself with the example,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
which is called the size of the market.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
This is a society with limited responsibility

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
for roofing.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
This is a society with limited responsibility

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
called Aristotle.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
The geographical location of this society is Yaroslavl.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
This example

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
gives an example of research

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
of the size of the market

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
in this city for entrepreneurs

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
who do business from home.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
The next section is called

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
the size of the market and its trends.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Here you need to describe the total market size

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
and the sector in which your business will develop.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Study the statistical data

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
and information about the successfully functioning sectors of the market

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
at the present time

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
to predict future trends and developments.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
In addition, you need to stop at your target market

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
using geographical data,

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
the size of the company,

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
the lifestyle, gender, age,

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
gender and other data

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
to describe the characteristics of the organization

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
and individual clients

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
who will buy your product or service.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
You need to decide

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
whether you work with organizations

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
or with private clients.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
If you work with both,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
you will need to describe both clients.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Next,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
we need to familiarize ourselves with the example of the size of the market.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
This example is given in the applications.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
It is called the size of the market

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
and

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
it describes

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
the activity of a society with limited responsibility

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Aristotle

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
in the study of the market in the city of Yaroslavl.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
Entrepreneurs are being studied

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
who are engaged in private business from home.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
What useful tips are given here?

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
First, you need to pay attention to the factors

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
that affect the growth of the market.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
The trends in the industry,

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
the socio-economic trends,

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
the government policy,

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
migration of the population

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
and other similar factors.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
You need to note

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
how these trends will affect your business.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
This will not be just a list of factors,

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
but again,

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
write in the form of a related story.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
There is such a trend

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
and such a trend will affect my business,

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
the activity of my enterprise in some way.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
In addition, you must specify the sources of information.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
The sources of information

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
will demonstrate to the reader of the business plan

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
that you have studied the relevant literature

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
and that your information is objective.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
When writing a business plan,

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
there should not be subjective judgments,

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
as we have already said,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
there should be only an objective reality.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
The next section is called competition.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
In the competition section,

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
you need to tell

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
in which sector of the market

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
your goods or services

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
are competitive.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
You need to tell briefly

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
about each of the competitors

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
and explain why you can compete with them

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
and win or seize

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
part of their market share.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Divide the strong and weak sides of the competitors

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
by such parameters as

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
sales volume,

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
quality,

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
distribution,

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
price,

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
production capacity,

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
image,

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
and variety of goods or services.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
You need to answer such questions

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
as who is the leader in price,

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
who is the leader in quality,

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
who has seized the largest share of the market,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
why some companies have recently entered the market

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
and continue to work there,

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
and some companies have entered the market

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
and left the market.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
You need to answer these questions.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
This is the task of the competition section.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
In the electronic tool,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
there is an example of competitive analysis

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
in the city of Arkhangelsk.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
There,

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
a company is opening

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
for photo services

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
and detailed competitive analysis

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
is being carried out

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
on existing competitors

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
that are engaged in photo services.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
What useful tips are there?

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
First, when you write a business plan,

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
you should not say that you have competitors.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
There have always been and will always be competitors.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
If you write this,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
first, you will give your subjective judgment,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
that means you have not worked out the information in detail,

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
you just did not find competitors.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
And the second point, which is negative,

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
creditors will not believe you

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
if you write that you have no competitors.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
To determine the strengths and weaknesses of competitors,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
you need to assess the real advantages

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
that push customers to buy goods from them,

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
and not from some other sellers.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
And the last piece of advice

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
that should be adhered to

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
is that you should not develop ridiculous plans.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Again, for the same reasons.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
First, creditors will not believe you,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and secondly, you are deluding yourself.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
A common mistake is

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
when you plan modest results in the first years,

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
due to the opening of the enterprise,

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
you think that it will be difficult for you

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
and your business will move slowly

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
and in small steps,

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
and then, when your business develops,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
you will have an explosion.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
In fact, this is not the case.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
You should consider the development of your business

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
in a stable, consistent way

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
both in the first and subsequent years.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
And in any case,

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
you need to reinforce your conclusions

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
and your subjective judgments

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
with objective factors.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
The next section that we will consider

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
is called the forecast sales volume.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
This section should include

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
sales volume in units of goods

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and in units of money.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Here, in a short summary,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
in one paragraph,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
tell us about the differences

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
between your goods or services

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
from goods or services

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
implemented by other companies on the market.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
What are the prospects of the number of buyers on the market

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and what are the planned events

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
to attract them to the number of customers?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The same thing.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Please open the e-mail

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and read the forecast sales volume.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
What are the following tips?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
If you receive data

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
about the average sales of a buyer

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
from official publications,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
from the results of personnel surveys,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
interviews with the owners of enterprises

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
or other information materials,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
be sure to specify these sources.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
First,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
the first point is

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
that you are already officially using this information.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
This is already good.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And the second point is

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
that you will convince the reader of your business plan

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that you have studied these materials

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and are familiar with the information.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The next section,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
under the section of the market,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
is called the production plan.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Here you need to describe

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
the state of your goods or services at the moment

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and what you plan to undertake

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
for its development.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
This section is represented by five subsections.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
The first subsection is called

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
the current state of affairs.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
The second subsection is the production process.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
The third is the cost of development.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
The fourth and the next section

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
is the required labor costs.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And the last subsection

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
is the costs and capital costs.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
For each of these subsections,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
the first subsection is called

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
the current state of affairs.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Here you describe

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
the state, the degree of readiness

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
of your goods or services

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and what remains to be done

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
so that your goods are fully ready

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
to enter the market.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
If your goods are ready to enter the market,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
you note this.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
If you need any improvements,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
you write a detailed plan

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
on how to do this.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
For these purposes,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
a traditional draft plan

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
for making a timetable is used.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
For example,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
you write dates in the left column,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
and write events in the right column.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Or vice versa.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
You write a date in the hat,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and write events in the left column.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
The final version

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
should be simple and clear to the reader.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
The draft version of the plan

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
is made for you,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and the final version

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
of the enterprise development

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
will be placed in the business plan.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
An example of a draft version

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
of the enterprise development

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
with a breakdown

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
of events and dates

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
is given in the following example,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
which is called

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
a draft version of the enterprise development plan.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Business plan

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
The production process

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
is an important section

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
of the business plan,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
since the investor will invest money

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
only in the business

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
that is clear and understandable to him.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Therefore, here you need to go

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
through all stages

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
from the moment of creation of an idea

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
to the moment of sale.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
What are the useful tips

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
that professionals give here?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
First, you need to justify

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
the strategy of the organization

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
chosen for you

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
from the point of view of getting more profit.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Either this is your own production

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
of services,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
or this is hiring private individuals

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
or other enterprises.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Very often, enterprises fully provide

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
the whole process.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
They make purchases

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and work with the hands of other people.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And often there is still such a moment

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
when a combined enterprise is being made.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
In any case,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
either you do everything yourself,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
or you hire some private professionals,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
or you do everything together,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
everything needs to be justified and explained.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The next point

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
that needs to be pointed out

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
are the reasons that affected

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
the choice of the location of your enterprise.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And the last point,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
which we have already discussed.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
In one of the examples,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
we analyzed a home business.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
If you also have a home business,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
you need to describe its advantages

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and indicate why you are doing

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
this particular business.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Indicate that your business

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
is possible for the organization

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
in its home conditions

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
and no negative consequences

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
will be caused by the location

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
of all your work

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
in the home conditions.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And a few more comments

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
about the strategy.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
What we have discussed,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
either you produce or you buy,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
you first make a description,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
and then you already

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
designate the strategy.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
That is,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
despite the fact that you will

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
either produce or buy,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
you must formulate a strategy.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
A clear, specific strategy,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
that you, for example, said,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
yes, we only produce,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
or yes, we only buy,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
naturally cannot be.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
At some point,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
you will step back from this strategy,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
but it is a strategy

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
that should be flexible.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Therefore, you decide for yourself

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
that we only produce,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
we only buy,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
or we both produce and buy.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And then, when you choose

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
the tactics of achieving these goals,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
you will be able to

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
make a decision

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
that will be more

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
effective for you.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Well, about the location of your work.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You need to specify

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
where your goods or services are located.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
This is again related

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
to the point of view of profit,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
from the point of view of

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
financial resources,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
from the point of view of costs.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
If you have chosen a place for rent,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
you have chosen it,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
geographically,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
for example,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
convenient access roads are located,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
or, on the other hand,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
it is located outside the city,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
but you have chosen this enterprise for rent,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
because there is a low cost of rent.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
There, for example,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
it is convenient for suppliers,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
you can organize convenient entrances,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
or you choose some area

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
where the cost of labor is low,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
the cost of materials is low.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
There are many factors here,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
how you choose a place of activity,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and all these factors need to be justified.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
The next section is called

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
the cost of production and development.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Here you need to describe

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
and justify the articles of the budget for development.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Here the cost of labor,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
materials,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
consulting services,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and the cost of services

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
of the so-called auxiliary workers,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
which are called office workers,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
well, as an example,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
you can bring lawyers.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
What useful professional advice

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
do you have here?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Well, first of all,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
before you start doing this,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
you need to determine

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
some starting point for yourself.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
You need to contact the trading organizations

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
to determine the average cost

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
of product development

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
similar to yours.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And already when you start

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
your business plan,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
you will have an orientation

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
that you should adhere to.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Next, you need to make a plan

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
in case of a break in the delivery deadlines,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
a failure to meet industry standards,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
mistakes, and so on.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
This should never be avoided.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
There is no predictable business.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Business is always

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
unpredictable.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
This is what is called

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
an additional costs plan.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Of course, you do not foresee everything,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
but you can assume something,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
we will even say in quotation marks

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
to foresee,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and you can write it down

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
in the form of some rough plan.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And this is what you should do

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
in case of a break in the delivery deadlines.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
And the next step

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
is to determine

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
the cost of obtaining patents

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
and other costs

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
that are necessary

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
for the production of your goods and services.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
This is a very important section,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
so we stopped at it in detail.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
The next point

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
is the required labor costs.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Regarding the required labor costs,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
all labor costs

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
that are required

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
are the following.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Is there enough qualified staff

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
to perform the work

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
that you have planned?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
If not,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
how will you hire staff?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Or will you turn to another market?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Or will you take

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
some other actions?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
This should be considered

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and reflected in the business plan.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
The next point

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
is the qualification of your employees.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Are your employees qualified enough?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
There are several options.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
If they are not qualified enough,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
you should simply reflect this in your business plan.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
The second option

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
is to reduce the costs.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
You intentionally hire unqualified employees,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
but you train them during the training.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
If this is the case,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
you should indicate how you plan to train them.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
The cost of the current

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and future labor costs are also indicated here.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And, again,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
at the time of training,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
you should indicate a promising plan

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
for training staff.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
In the electronic certificate,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
as we have already discussed,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
there are examples

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
of the implementation

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
of this section of the business plan.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
This example is called

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
the required labor costs.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Please open this electronic certificate

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
as we address the examples.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And read these examples.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
In the future,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
this will help you write your business plan.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I am telling you this

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
not so that you

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
read all these examples

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
dryly,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
but so that you can see

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
how these examples are implemented by professionals

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and how you can use this example

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
to write your business plan section.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Examples are given not so that you

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
take some pieces of these examples

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
and insert them into your business plan,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
but examples are given so that you

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
analyze this information

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
and, based on the analysis,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
you have already made your business plan sections.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The next section is called

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
the costs and capital costs.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Here,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
you will need

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
three financial documents

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
that will be the basis

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
for the financial section of the business plan.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
As we said,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
we do not make up the financial business plan

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
because you study it

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
in other disciplines.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
But for the real business plan,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
these three documents are very important,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
and the financial plan

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
is based on these

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
three documents.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
What are these documents?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
The first document is the current costs.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
The second document is the capital costs.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And the third document is the cost of goods.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Current costs are classified

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
as marketing expenses,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
expenses related to sales

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and overhead expenses.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
The second point is the capital costs.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
These are the money

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
to purchase equipment

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
for the initial and subsequent stages

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
of your business development.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
In addition,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
amortization calculations

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
for the wear of purchased equipment.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Very often,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
amortization calculations

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
are recommended

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
in all literature

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
to pay attention to this,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
because it is a large amount

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
of capital costs.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
The next document

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
is the cost of goods.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
It includes raw materials, equipment,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
wages, etc.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
For a seller,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
whether it is a retail seller

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
or wholesale seller,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
these are expenses for buying inventory.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
For a production enterprise,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
these are raw materials,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
labor resources

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and overhead expenses

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
directly related to production.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Take a creative approach

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
to this process

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
and include in the current costs,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
capital costs

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and cost of goods

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
everything you think

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
will be relevant for your organization.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Now we move on

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
to the next section of the business plan,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
which is called sales and marketing.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Sales and marketing

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
consists of several sections.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
This section describes the strategy

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and tactics that you use

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
to attract buyers.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
The sales and marketing section

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
includes three sections.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
The first section is called

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
sales and marketing strategy.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
The second section is called

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
the sales method.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And the third section is called

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
advertising, promotion of goods, services.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
The next section

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
is called sales and marketing strategy.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
This is a very important section.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Here you choose the strategy

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
that you will use.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
The strategy should include

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
no more than a few sentences

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
or a couple of paragraphs.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
An important element

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
for the sales and marketing strategy

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
is the choice of target customers.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Other elements of the sales and marketing strategy

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
are how you will find

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
the clients you are looking for

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
and how you will inform them

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
about your product.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
What features of your product

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
or service will you emphasize

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
so that the buyer will notice your product?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
What innovative methods

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
of sales and marketing

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
will you use?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Will you focus your efforts

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
in the region, in the country

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
or in the international market?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Are you planning to expand

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
the sales scale in the future and why?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Here I would like to refer

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
to the examples that we have

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
in the applications.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
The first example is for a society

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
called Ukrov,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
where they talk about enterprises

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
that have been existing

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
in the market for a long time

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
and have their own niche

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
but are trying to strengthen

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
their influence.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It is described in great detail

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
how this organization

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
finds the clients it is looking for

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and how it informs them

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
about its product.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
In addition,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
it is described in great detail

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
about the innovative methods

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
of sales and marketing

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
that this organization uses.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Please, look at this example

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and when you write your task

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and when you borrow ideas

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
and methods of describing this section

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
in a society

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
with a limited responsibility

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
of Ukrov

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
regarding this section

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
of sales and marketing strategy,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
for those who work

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
not with existing enterprises

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
but with enterprises

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
that are just about to open,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
an example has been developed

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
called

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Business Plan for Enterprises

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
without Legal Person

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
or COLARIT.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
As we have already said,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
this example

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
contains a lot of information

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
that does not correspond

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
to the business plan writing method.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It was done for educational purposes

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
but nevertheless

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
there was an attempt

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
to write this business plan.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
This is a very important point

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and it is very important

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
to understand

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
that this method

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
is not a solution

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
to solve the problem

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
of the business plan

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
that is being written

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
by the legal person

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
and that is why

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
it is necessary

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
to write a business plan

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
that is not a solution

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
to solve the problem

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
of the business plan

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
that is why

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
it is necessary

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
to understand

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
that this is a very important point

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
that is why

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
it is necessary

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
to understand

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
that this is a very important point

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
that is why

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
a business plan

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
is a very important part

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
of our business plan.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It is also a good idea

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
to write a business plan

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
that does not correspond

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
to the marketing.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Sales is how to deliver a product to a customer.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Marketing is how to inform

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
a customer about the product.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
If the method of sales,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
as we said,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
is the organization of a trading point,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
marketing is how to tell the information

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
that this product

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
is in your trading point.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
The next piece of advice

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
is

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
to tell about the advantages

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
that you will get

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
using the representatives

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
or distributors.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
That is, you will indicate

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
which companies will deliver

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
your product,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
or it will be some private persons.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
In any case, you need to indicate

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
what advantages

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
this company will give you,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
what advantages will another company give you,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
and

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
why you chose

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
this particular method.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
In addition, you need to take into account

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
individual features,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
individual characteristics.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
If you use

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
legal sellers

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
or some physical persons,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
or it will be brokers

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
or trading agents,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
everyone has their own features.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And here we need to talk about the fact

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
that some sellers

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
need a fairly long period of time,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
sometimes about a year,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
in order to familiarize themselves

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
with the product and the territory.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
To familiarize oneself means

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
to be able to sell it,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
to offer it,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
and to know which part of the territory

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
this product is sold,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
and which part is not sold.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Sometimes there are such moments

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
when the same trading representatives

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
or some shops

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
sell goods

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
that bring a lot of profit

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
and that bring a little profit.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Nevertheless,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
the assortment of goods

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
should include

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
those goods that bring more profit

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
and those goods that bring less profit.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
In any case,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
those representatives

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
you invite

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
should be clearly instructed

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
that they should provide

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
a complete assortment of the company.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
This is the policy of the company,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
not the policy of the seller

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
who sells something.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
You will have a cross-section of interests here.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
That is, the seller

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
who will sell your product

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
wants to take the best-selling goods

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
and sell them,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
and he will sell them.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
As an organizer of this business,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
in order to maintain the image of your organization,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
in order to maintain the reputation of the organization,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
you need to sell other goods

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and you need to maintain a wide range.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Therefore, in order for your distributor network

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
to promote your goods and services,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
you will need to develop

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
a special system of incentives.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
This system of incentives is called in different ways

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
bonuses,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
discounts, etc.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
You will have to

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
pay close attention to this issue

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
and work personally

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
with each agent

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
you will work with.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
You have to work here as psychologists

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
and understand

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
what motivates to sell this seller,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
what motivates to sell this seller,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
and what motivates to sell this seller.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
When you work with these

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
with your

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
agents or organizations

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
who will sell your goods,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
after that you will already have information

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
and you will use it

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
from the point of view of profitability

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
this resource that you have.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
This is a very important point

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
of developing a special system of incentives.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
If you do not develop a system of incentives,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
you will have some

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
sometimes we will say

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
negative and root consequences

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
when some agent

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
will develop a system of incentives for himself

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
because you did not do it for him.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Please pay attention to this useful advice

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
of professionals.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
The next section is called

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
advertising and promotion of goods or services.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But we are already moving to the section

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
when we do not sell goods,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
but we do marketing

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
and promote this product or service.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Here, this section includes

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
all advertising tools

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
that you are going to use.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
These can be newspapers,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
magazines, radio, television,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
yellow pages,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
communication programs with the public,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
disposable advertising tools

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
and so on.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
This is a very large list of events

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
that you will use,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
but do not try to cover all these events.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Choose only those events

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
that are useful for you

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
in terms of profitability.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
The next section is called

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
advertising and promotion of goods or services.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
This is a very important point

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
of developing a system of incentives.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
If you do not develop a system of incentives,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
you will have some

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
sometimes we will say

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
negative and root consequences

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
when some agent

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
or a company

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
will not be able to

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
promote a product or service.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Remember, when we started

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
to consider this course,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
we said that the goal of any business

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
is to make a profit.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And again, consider here

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
whether it is worth investing

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
in newspapers, magazines and television

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
that will not give you a return.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Keep in mind that you are not

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
some global organization

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
like Coca-Cola,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
which is known all over the world

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
and there will be no such means

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
at this stage.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And you need to choose,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
as they say, life by means

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
and choose only those means of information

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
that are available to you

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
and that will bring you

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
profit at the first stages.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
In the future, if you grow up

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and if you are competitive,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
for example, with the same Coca-Cola,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
you can advertise yourself

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
in every corner.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
At the same time,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
your advertising should be reasonable.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
This is what professionals give.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
First of all, you need to check

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
that your advertising tactics

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
coincide with the sales tactics.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
What is meant here?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Advertising tactics is

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
how you convey information

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
to your customer.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
If, for example, you work

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
with an advertising agent

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
who sells your product,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
supply him with advertising

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
products about your product.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
He, for example,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
this same advertising agent

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
will sell your product.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Again, develop a system of incentives

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
so that he not only sells your product,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
but also spreads some leaflets

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
and spreads some information

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
about your product.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And besides this,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
so that he collects

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
the so-called feedback,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
feedback on your product.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
If, for example, he came

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
to some organization,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
sold the product and left,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
this agent will be very unprofitable

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
from the point of view of advertising tactics.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
If he collected information

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
that he lacks

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
or maybe even made a list

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
in which he would include

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
such and such goods,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
his customers asked him,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
it will be a sales agent

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
who will simultaneously perform

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
both the functions of a sales agent

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and an advertising agent.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And, of course, for such a sales agent

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
you need to develop

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
your own system of incentives

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
and your own system,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
maybe even of punishment.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And the next thing

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
is the original packaging of the product.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The original packaging of the product

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
is a component part of marketing.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
In order to develop

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
an attractive packaging,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
you need to spend enough effort

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
and time and funds on it.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Here you can also work

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
together with your sales agents

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and advertising agents

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
and representatives, and so on.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
That is, here, again,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
feedback is collected.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
This is just a marketing study.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I mean feedback.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That is, the person who works

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
with your customers,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
with your customers,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
he collects information.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It can be anyone.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
As we said, it can be

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
either a sales agent

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
or a salesman

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
who works at a trading point

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
and, let's say, even a cashier

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
who sits at the checkout.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
He can also serve

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
as a connecting link

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
at what stage you need

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
to do something.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Of course, the cashier

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
has his own function,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
and the cashier performs

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
only certain functions.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Nevertheless, you can

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
attract the cashier to this activity

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
and create an atmosphere

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
around him.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Just put the same flyers

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
where the opinion of the customer

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
about how this is done

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
or how this is done

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
would be asked.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
In Russian conditions,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
this information is

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
widely spread.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And very often,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
when customers come to the checkout,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
they often fill out some forms,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
fill out some surveys.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And even special people

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
are sometimes attracted to this case,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
who conduct these marketing studies

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
for the appropriate reward.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And this feedback,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
this connection that exists

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
between the customer

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
and these advertising agents,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
it is transmitted to the marketing department

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
and, in general,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
this data and this connection

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
are already transferred to the company,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
and the company makes some changes

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
to the product,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
including the packaging

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
that we started talking about.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
The packaging can be made

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
standard and simple at the first stage,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and then this packaging

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
will be modified.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
But modify this packaging

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
not based on some statistical data

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
not related to your customers,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
but use the feedback of the customers,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
and this feedback

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
will be transferred to the packaging.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
The next point is

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
participation in exhibitions.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
If you participate in some exhibitions,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and these exhibitions will be

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
part of your advertising tactics,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
be sure to tell about it

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
in the business plan.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Specify all the events

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
you plan to participate in.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
But don't just list the events

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
and say that we will participate

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
on this date,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
on this date,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
on this day,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
on this day,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
on this day,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
on this day.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Why do you think

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
that participation in this exhibition

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
will bring you profit?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And one more point

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
that should be specified.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I just mentioned

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
that participation in this exhibition

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
will bring profit.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
In fact, if you consider

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
not a long-term plan,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
not a long-term strategy,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
but a long-term plan,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
the results will be obtained

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
in the future,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
when this exhibition

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
will start to work.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Or rather, not even an exhibition,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
but the results of those clients

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
who went to this exhibition

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
will begin to affect.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
That is, they will begin

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
to spread information

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
about your company,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000
they will begin to buy

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
your products.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
In addition,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
the results of the exhibition

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
will be positive only,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I mean positive

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
in terms of balance and profit,

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
only after some time.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
You will not get the results

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
of this exhibition right away.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Therefore, when you make

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
your business plan

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and when you plan this exhibition,

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
take into account these costs

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and distribute them over the period.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
It is very important to convince

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
the investor or maybe not the investor,

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
but the partner who will invest

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
in this exhibition

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
with some ideas,

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
maybe technologies,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
that participation in this exhibition

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
is necessary and that further participation

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
in this exhibition will be paid off.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
This is how it is done at the exhibitions.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Management

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
The next section

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
that we will consider

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
is called Management.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
This is a very important section

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
in terms of internal communications,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
planning, motivation of staff,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
and so on.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You have considered this section

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
in other disciplines,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
such as strategic management,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
general management,

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
and so on.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Here you will need to apply

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
all your knowledge

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
in order to briefly describe

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
everything that you have studied

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
earlier in this section.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
What are the main positions here?

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
One of the main positions

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
is that a good team of managers

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
can take even an average business idea

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and make it a great business.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And vice versa,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
poor management is often unable

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
to implement even a very good business idea.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Based on this,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
you need to select the personnel for the organization.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
When you will describe this section,

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
think about the fact

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
that this section of the business plan

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
should demonstrate

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
that the team of managers

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
that you have selected

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
or will select

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
is able to manage effectively.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
This section consists of four subsections.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
The first subsection

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
is the description of the management functions.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
The second subsection is the right to property.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
The third subsection is the board of directors

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
or the board of consultants.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And the fourth subsection

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
is the services for business support.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
The first subsection

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
is the description of the management functions.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Before selecting the personnel,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
you need to clearly specify

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
who will perform what duties.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Thus, use this subsection

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
to describe the managers of the company,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
including the duties

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
of the manager.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
The demonstration

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
that your managers

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
have or will have

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
a wide range of various skills

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
will convince investors

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
that the business will be successful.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Describe in detail

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
who you see as candidates

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
for those vacancies that are not yet filled.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
What skills and experience

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
should these candidates have

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
to fulfill the goals set

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
before the enterprise?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
What are the main challenges

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
that you face

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
in your department?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
You may face such moments

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
that initially you planned one thing,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
but then you found

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
that some solution

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
will be more effective.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Based on the fact

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
that various management schemes

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
are used for various organizations.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
If we return

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
to our two examples,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
one example is

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
a society with a limited responsibility for blood,

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
which is a business

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
that is not yet

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
fully established.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
The second example

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
is a company

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
without a legal person

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
who is just entering the market.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Naturally,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
these two organizations

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
have different goals and tasks.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
If you look at the section

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
describing the management functions

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
in these two business plans,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
you will see

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
that for a society

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
with a limited responsibility for blood,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
a functional structure is clearly described

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
and what measures should be taken

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
to strengthen this functional structure,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
which is taken as the basis

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
of management in this organization.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
If you look at another organization,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
PBOYUL Colorit,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
there is only one person

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
who will be engaged

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
in management functions

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
at the first stage.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And furthermore,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
it is written that

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
two or three more people

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
will be involved

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
in the management functions.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Naturally,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
since this organization

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
is just opening up

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
and,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
like any other

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
opening up organization,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
this organization

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
does not have enough funds,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
the business plan was written

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
by the entrepreneurs themselves

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
with the involvement

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
of as few specialists as possible.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And therefore,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
there are a lot of mistakes

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
when writing a business plan.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
In the business plan,

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
these mistakes are commented on

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
and you will see,

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
make your own business plan

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
from the comparison of these two descriptions.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
The first description is for blood,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
where the functional structure is considered

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
and with a detailed consideration

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
of what needs to be done

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
to strengthen the functional structure.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
This is one extreme.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
The second extreme

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
is when we have a raw,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
poorly developed section

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
of this business plan,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000
where there are obvious mistakes

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
of non-professionals

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
who made this business plan.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Take into account both of these extremes

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
and create something of your own

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
in which you would describe

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
clearly the management functions

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
for each manager.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Well, we talked about

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
that if you have a business plan

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
with a wide range of various skills,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
it will convince investors

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
that the business will be successful.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
On the other hand,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
think about

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
that if your organization is large,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
then the management skills

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
should be less diverse.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
They should be more specific

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
and more concentrated,

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
as we said.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
That is, if at the lowest levels

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
of management

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
there are people

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
who are not very good

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
at the management functions,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
but who have

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
universal skills,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
then at the top

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
you should have people

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
who have specific skills

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
and who are not subordinate

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
to diverse people

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
who perform various functions,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
but there are 2, 3, 4 people

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
with whom the work

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
on creating management documents,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
on creating various plans,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
strategies and so on

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
is already being carried out.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
This should be taken into account

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
and taken into account.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
What advice do professionals

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
give here

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
about writing this section?

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Well, firstly,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
you do not need to distribute people

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
by departments,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
but only to assign responsible people

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
who will perform certain functions

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
as necessary.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
This useful advice

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
is given to organizations

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
that are engaged in a rather

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
small business

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
that is, it can be said

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
about a small business

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
and enterprises of a medium business

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
that are only included in this niche.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
If you are talking about enterprises

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
of a large business,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
then you will need to distribute people

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
by departments,

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
as is done in the example of OO «Krov»

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
and it is by departments

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
to assign functions

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
for certain people.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
The next advice is to include

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
appropriate details in the description of the management.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
This means that

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
the information that is needed

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
for the management

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
is usually not necessary.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
That is,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
this is information that is needed

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
for the department of personnel,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
information that is needed

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
for some other services.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Therefore, put the full summary

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
in the application,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and in the description of the management

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
describe only what relates

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
to management

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
according to each candidate,

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
according to each vacancy.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And if you are talking about

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
the management of the whole company,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
write here only what relates

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
to higher management.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Next, the next advice is

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
to focus attention on those people

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
whose career is dedicated to work

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
related to your business.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Naturally, if a person has spent

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
several years in business

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and is already familiar

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
with this environment,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
precisely with the environment

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
in which he will continue to work,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
then this will be the key,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
this person will be the key

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
in your organization.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Therefore, when you will make

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
a summary, a short summary of these people,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
put them first,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
start with them,

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and then move on to people

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
who are less related

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
to your business.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And finally, describe those people

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
who have little to do

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
with your business,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
but who, for example,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
have well-developed management skills,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
management knowledge,

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
and who are attracted

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
to work in your organization.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
The next point is description.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Arrange the description

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
in the reverse chronological order

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
and highlight the most significant

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
achievements in work.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Well, as with any summary,

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
you start with the latest,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000
or rather the earliest places of work

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and end with the latest.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
But do not overload,

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
do not overload the so-called

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
career ladder.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
You should highlight

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
3-4 places of work,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
because if a person has been doing something

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
for a very long time,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
then it is unlikely that something

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
has already remained from that previous experience.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And highlight the most significant

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
achievements in work.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
If a person even had something

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
in the previous experience,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
as I said a long time ago,

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
but it was a very significant achievement

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
and it played a big role in his career,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
then it is natural to highlight it.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And another point

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
is to focus on experience

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
and skills,

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
not knowledge.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
If you focus

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
on education,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
then it will be a mistake

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
in terms of describing managers.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Then we will say

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
when we select

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
auxiliary staff,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
then, yes,

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
for example,

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
for economists,

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
for financiers,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
it turns out

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
what kind of educational institution

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
this person graduated from.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Especially in the West,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
maybe just one link or recommendation

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
that a student, for example,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
graduated from Harvard,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
it will already play a role.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
In our conditions, this is not the case.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
You need to focus on the work experience

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
that is related to your business.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
And besides,

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
finish in this section

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
describing what experience

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
and skills are required

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
for a full-time job.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Try to make this description flexible.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Do not write tough instructions

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
that you need to do this,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
this, this and this.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Divide this knowledge and skills

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
into key and auxiliary.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Start with key skills.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Describe these key skills

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
and focus on them.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
After that, list the auxiliary skills.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
When the same, for example,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
department of personnel

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
that you will work in

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
or the person who will do it

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
naturally he will look for

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
key skills,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
but sometimes there are such moments

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
when it is difficult to find a person

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
who would satisfy these requirements

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
100%.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
In this case, auxiliary skills will be considered.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
In this case, you will get

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
a flexible summary,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
a flexible description of the vacancy.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
The next section

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
is called the right to property.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
In this section,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
you describe the key people

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
who are the owners

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
and control the activity

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
of your enterprise.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
In addition,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
here are indicated

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
directly the owners.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
In this section,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
you need to specify who can

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
join the number of these owners.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Or this is any person

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
who can purchase

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
a share of the company's shares.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Or this is a limited number of people.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
That is, you need to describe

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
what share of the company's shares

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
can be purchased.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
If you write a business plan

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
to get financial funds,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
it will be very important.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
That is, how will he join your company.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Or he will purchase shares

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
and become an owner

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
and will purchase them in such a size

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
that he will solve all the issues.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Or he can purchase

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
only a limited number of shares

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and have a very weak impact

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
on this company.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
That is, here again you need to look.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
On the one hand, you need to attract

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
a potential investor,

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
who will think about

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
how you look at the further management

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
of the company.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Or are you going to give

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
the management of this company to someone

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
who may not even be competent.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Or are you still going to own this company

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
and manage it yourself.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
This is what this section of the right of ownership exists for.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
On the one hand,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I told you that in the right of ownership

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
there should be a lot of such moments

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
who and how will manage the company.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
But on the other hand,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
the formulation of the right of ownership

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
is very simple and concise.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
If you open the e-mail,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
there is a formulation of the right of ownership

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
and literally there are 2-3 sentences.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Who owns what.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
For example, the formulation is made in such a way

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
that the director owns 95% of the shares

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
and his assistant owns 5% of the shares.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
There is not a word about

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
that someone can buy this enterprise

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
or join the right of ownership.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But this is the formulation of the right of ownership

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
in the example.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
You make your own formulation of the right of ownership

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
and take into account that the one who reads this business plan

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
and if he wants to invest in this enterprise,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
it is unlikely that he will be able to arrange such a formulation

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
when he will not be able to acquire any share of the company

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
and, accordingly, not become the co-owner of this company.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Here, in addition to the formal moments

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
that we have discussed now,

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
it is necessary to write who is included in the board of directors or consultants.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
This means names, positions, education, qualifications.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
It is necessary to dwell in detail on the experience of each member of the board of directors

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
and how each of these members will influence the prosperity of your business.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
There are two points here.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
On the one hand, the members of the board of directors

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
are people who financially support the company.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
On the other hand, these are people who have some connections

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
and who are specialists.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
If they are specialists, describe those people

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
who are in this board of directors or consultants,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
how their experience and knowledge will be used

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
to provide qualified assistance in managing the company

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
and in the qualifications that they have,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
not from the point of view of management,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
but, for example, in the board of your directors,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.000
there is a specialist who can perform some technical tasks.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
That is, on the one hand, he is a manager,

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
on the other hand, he is a specialist, let's say, in IT technologies.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Describe how you will attract him

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
both for the management of the company

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
and for providing some services to the company

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000
in the development of IT technologies, etc.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
In addition, you need to specify the connections of the board of directors

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
and the opportunities for attracting additional capital.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Useful tips that professionals give when writing this section.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
First, you need to formulate a tip that complements the existing management.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:33.000
You have a team of managers who are engaged in managing the organization.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
It is recommended to make a table in which you need to indicate skills

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
that are required to promote your company,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
so that your company flourishes and moves up.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
List out of these skills those that already exist

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
and which managers already have.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
If you do not have these skills,

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
think about who to include in the board to complement the existing management.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000
The next tip is typical for Western companies,

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
for Western entrepreneurs, for the Western style of management,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
but it is not typical for Russian reality.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
This tip sounds like you need to avoid frequent repeated mistakes

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
when the board of directors is formed of friends.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
First of all, think about what business qualities are needed,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
and only then think about friends.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
If you form a board of directors of friends,

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
very often these subjective factors,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
these connections that will limit you and keep you,

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
will not give you the opportunity to develop the company.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
We have already said in the previous section

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
that it is necessary to talk about what connections exist

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
among the members of the board of directors,

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
but this does not mean friendly and family ties,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
but business ties,

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
when the members of the board of directors can provide something for the company.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I repeat, the advice is that the board of directors

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
should try to avoid family and friendly ties,

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
at least at the first stages.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
The next tip is if the board of directors has not yet been formed,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
use this section to discuss the skills and experience

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
that you have planned for the board of directors.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
That is, you can make a project of some kind of document,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
a project of the board of directors,

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
in which you will present what you would like to see,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
and then as a result of the discussion you will change some points,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
add something, reduce something.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
The next section of the board of directors

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
is called services for business support.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000
We have already said that in order to ensure the normal work of the whole organization,

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000
you need auxiliary staff

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
who will provide the work of the main staff.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
This auxiliary staff does not belong to the department of management,

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
but nevertheless it is described in this section,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
since it serves as a background,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
it serves as a background for creating normal work of the main staff.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
It performs the core work that will support the work of other people.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
This is such a staff as lawyers, accountants, advertising agencies,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
technical workers and other employees

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
who provide the production process.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Here, when we talk about these people,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
we need to specify not only the experience of their work,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:55.000
not only their skills and some practical applications,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
but we also need to talk about their qualifications from the point of view of their education.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Because basically these are people who receive all the knowledge

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
during the training process,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
especially if you will attract some Western specialist for your organization,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000
pay close attention to where this person worked,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000
what are his recommendations, what education he received, and so on.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
That is, useful tips can sound like this.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Focus on the education of the auxiliary staff.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:36.000
This is a useful advice on the qualification of lawyers, accountants, and so on.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
When you recruit a manager,

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
you can say that he has some management skills

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
that appear only in the process of working with people.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
People like lawyers, accountants, and technical workers

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
receive their knowledge during the training process.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
If they did not receive this knowledge during the training process,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
they will develop with technical means and numbers.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
They will be accountants, they will be lawyers,

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
but they will not be as qualified as those people who received the appropriate education.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
A couple of more tips that are recommended.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
The first is to ask experienced people in the industry,

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
companies and private individuals who provide high-quality auxiliary services

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
for business organization and service.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Here you can use your relatives, anyone,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
who would recommend you where to get high-quality auxiliary staff.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Your relatives will not offend you if they tell you

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000
that they hired high-quality auxiliary staff for their organization.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
But this advice will be useful for you,

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
because you will not waste time and money

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
to hire staff and then test it on your organization.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
This recommendation would be useful for your relatives.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
In addition to this subjective factor of the recommendation of relatives,

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
there is also the so-called official information.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
This official information is located in the listed companies

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
that provide auxiliary services for business organization and service.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
This information can be found in professional trading magazines

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
and other official publications.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
The last section that we will consider is called the financial plan.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
As we have already said, the financial plan is a very serious document.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.000
In some cases, entrepreneurs even make two business plans.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
One business plan for the main technical part,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
and the second business plan for the same main, but financial part.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And the third business plan is not an independent part,

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
but an auxiliary part, that is, an application.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000
We consider the financial plan only as a introductory part,

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
because you have considered it in other disciplines.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And within such a short course,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
you cannot consider the financial plan in detail.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
What is it?

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
The financial plan is a verbal description

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
confirmed by financial reports,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
which document the vitality of the business

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
and its attractiveness from the point of view of investment.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
When writing a financial plan,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000
entrepreneurs use a large number of different documents,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
and again, different entrepreneurs act differently.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Some take these financial documents to the application,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000
some leave them in the sections of the financial plan itself.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
What are the options here?

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
If the business plan is written for investors,

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
then the section of the financial plan includes all the information

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
and consists of the following sections.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
The first section is the risk section.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
The second section is the report on the movement of money.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
The third section is the balance of money spending and receipts.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
The fourth section is the report on profits and losses.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And the fifth section is the requested amount of financing and profitability.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Of these five sections, which you can see on the screen,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
the first section is the risk section,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
and the last section is the requested amount of financing and profitability.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000
They are important for a person who will read this financial business plan

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
from the point of view of investment.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Three other documents, the report on the movement of money,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
the balance of money spending and receipts,

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
and the report on profits and losses,

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
are purely accounting documents.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
They are also important,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
but all these five sections can be divided into two large sections.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
The first section is the risk section,

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
and the requested amount of financing and profitability.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And the second section is accounting documents,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
which we have already mentioned.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
In this regard, you can see another option for writing a business plan,

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000
when the risk section is taken out completely into a separate section.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
We did not talk about this with you,

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
but there are other business plan options.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:14.000
In this case, if the business plan is used as a guide for business development,

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000
then only two accounting documents can be left out of these three documents,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
the report on the movement of money and the report on profits and losses.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
These documents contain all the necessary figures

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
by which you can assess the company's activity.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I repeat that within this course,

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
the composition of the listed documents is not required,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
it is only a matter of determining the point of loss,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
that is, this is the level of sales,

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
at which the total costs are equal to the total revenue from sales.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Or you can calculate the profitability coefficient as an option.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
The ratio of profit from the implementation of a product to the total costs.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
When is the point of no loss determined,

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
when is the profitability coefficient determined.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
The point of no loss is determined for small organizations,

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
for example, this is a company without a legal education.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Again, I agree with our example,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
this is an organization called Colorit,

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
which provides photo services.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Here it is enough to determine the point of no loss.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
The profitability coefficient is a more detailed document

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.000
that requires more effort and time to determine it.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Therefore, it is already used in organizations.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
The second example we are considering is a society

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
with a limited responsibility for blood.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
There you can determine the profitability coefficient.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
As an example, in the application of electronic aid,

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
a financial plan for the creation of a new company for public food,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
a coffee shop in the city of Moscow, is provided.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
This is a new enterprise, it did not exist before,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
and therefore the financial plan was made by the entrepreneurs themselves.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:10.000
We will not say rude, but some grammatical and stylistic mistakes.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Do not pay attention to this.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
If you make a similar financial business plan,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
then this will be enough.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Now about the task you are doing.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Now we have come to the point

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
when we have considered all the sections of our business plan

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
from the point of view of theory, from the point of view of methodology,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000
from the point of view of examples, from the point of view of performing control tasks.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000
We talked about four control tasks that we performed,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
and we talked about the fact that at the initial stage,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000
these control tasks are performed in the form of a draft draft.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:56.000
When you make a document, following the instructions

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:01.000
described in the task, at a certain stage,

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000
we have compiled these four documents and began to make a general document

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:14.000
called the business plan of the entire commercial enterprise.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
This is the final document, this is the fifth document that you make.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
In this fifth document, the artistic style of description is used,

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000
and in this fifth document, the data of the previous four documents are used.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000
I remind you again of two examples that we have.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
The first example is a society with a limited responsibility for blood.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
The second example is the Kalorit lawless enterprise.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Now, when you start writing your business plan,

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:59.000
use the sequence of the business plan, something like this.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
You open the business plan, for example,

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
the society with a limited responsibility for blood,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
and start with the title sheet, how it is performed in a society with a limited responsibility for blood.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Then you make a summary, and then you make a content.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
All these tasks have already been completed.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
You just need to transfer them to the basis that you should have made

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
from the point of view of the artistic style of description.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Next, you go to the section of the essence of the project.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
In the section of the essence of the project, we also performed control tasks.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
You take those control tasks that you have already completed.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
You have performed these control tasks dry, theoretically.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
You have listed the factors according to the instructions

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
that were written to perform each of these control tasks.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Now you are already transferring these control tasks to the final task,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
and again, you use the artistic style of description.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
I repeat once again that despite the fact that the second example,

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
which is called the Kalorit lawless enterprise,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
the business plan for this enterprise is written with errors,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.000
despite this, it can be used to write your business plan.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
You can look at some things, you can look at some moments from this business plan,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
but those details that are highlighted, when you open this tool,

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
you will see which parts of this business plan are erroneous.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
You just don't use them, they are included so that you avoid mistakes

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
when writing your business plan.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Well, in principle, everything according to our course.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000
As a result of studying the short business planning course,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
you have learned to formulate your thoughts in a short and clear way,

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
to formulate your business ideas and to express them in a simple and accessible form

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
on the computer screen and on paper.
