00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Now let's move on to the next step of the process management.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
What did we describe business processes for?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Probably, to understand what is wrong.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
How can we understand what is wrong in our company and what should we do next?

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
In order to understand what is wrong, we need to analyze our business processes,

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
and then we need to find out what processes we should take care of first.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
It is impossible to optimize everything at once.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Let's recall the Pareto principle.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
80% of business processes will yield 80% of the result.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
We start optimizing them first.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
You may ask, how can we understand which business process should be optimized first?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Here is the algorithm.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
First, we assess the importance of a business process.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Then we assess the problem of this business process.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
And third, we assess the possibility of making changes in this business process.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Which processes will be optimized first?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
The most important, the most problematic and the ones that are easiest to change.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes, there are very problematic and very important processes, but they cannot be changed.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
For example, it is impossible to rearrange a chair that is not in a good condition.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
It is impossible to melt a concrete chair.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Even if it is in a bad condition, it is impossible to do anything.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Only if you change the office.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
And this will be very problematic, because now, for example,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
it may be that you cannot find an office.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Therefore, once again, the most important, the most problematic and the ones that are easiest to change.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Now, let's talk about the points.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
What is the importance of a business process and how to determine it?

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
The importance is how important this business process is when implementing a development strategy.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Let's remember about the BSC and QPI course.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Let's immediately refer to the company strategy, the company's strategic and accounting map and your department.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
They will help you determine the importance of your business process.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
What are the ways to determine the importance of a business process?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
There are only four basic methods.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
The first one is an expert assessment.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
The second one is the development of the criteria of importance.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
The third one is a simple comparison with the key factors of success.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
And the fourth one is a weighting comparison with the key factors of success.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Let's look at all the methods in more detail.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
So, the first method is an expert assessment.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
What is it?

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
If we, let's say, don't know, can't develop the criteria of importance,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
we just take a business process,

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
gather a group of experts, preferably the participants and the person responsible for this business process,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
also the participants and the person responsible for the business process of the client of this process,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
and the participants and the person responsible for the supplier of this process.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
We give them a questionnaire and they fill it in.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Usually, they give the importance of this particular process by 5 or 10-point system.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Intuitively, by their own methods.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
For example, if you assess the importance of the business process of the trade of clothes,

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
you can invite the head of the process,

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
the participants, the manager of the purchases, the production, the sales,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
the representatives of the client,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
the suppliers,

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
and you can invite several more employees of your company,

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
for example, from the finance department,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
because they also participate in this business process,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and, accordingly, from the marketing department,

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
the head, who also participates in this business process at the time of sale,

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
and just ask them to put some point on this process of importance by 5 or 10-point system.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Then you just sum it up and take the average arithmetic,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
and get the average importance of this particular business process.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
If we talk about the method of expert assessment, it is very inaccurate.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
But you can understand it yourself.

04:29.000 --> 04:37.000
In fact, if you do not understand by what criteria one or another expert assessed the importance of the process,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
then it is quite possible that one manager has his own opinions,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
the second has his own, the third has his own.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Even if the strategy is known to everyone, there is still no single approach.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Therefore, this is the most unreliable, but at the same time the fastest way of assessment.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
So to say, express.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
Therefore, we usually recommend applying a slightly more complex, but a little more reliable method.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
This is called the development of criteria.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
You develop a kind of criteria for the importance of a particular business process.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
That is, by what criteria you will determine whether this process is important or not.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Let's take the example of the same company Evrika,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
which, as we remember, deals with tea, clothes and furniture.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
In general, what does it do?

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
It belongs to a certain owner, who is also the general director.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Let's say the strategy can be reduced to a certain formulation.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
I want to get maximum profit for as long as possible.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
The simplest requirement.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Accordingly, we could call the criteria of importance, for example,

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
the share of turnover of each business process,

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
the trade of tea, clothes, furniture, in general, the turnover of the company.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
Then the share of profit, the potential growth of each direction.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And some other strategic importance.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Some of the options, that is, there may be others.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
Then we list these criteria, which we have developed ourselves,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
and ask the experts, all the same experts,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
to assess the importance of this particular business process

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
according to specific criteria.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
But you must agree, the share of turnover cannot be invented,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
because it either exists or does not exist.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Therefore, this indicator is taken based on the accountability.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
The share of profit is the same.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
The share of potential growth is a partially expert indicator,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
but it can be based on past statistics.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
For example, such a direction grew at an average rate of 5% per year,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
such a rate is 10%, such a rate is 20%.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
We can predict that they will grow approximately the same.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But there will also be a share of expert assessment.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
And other strategic importance is, most likely, just an expert assessment.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
In the corresponding slide, we can see that, for example,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
for tea trading, the share of turnover was 10%,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
the share of profit was 15%, the potential growth was 100%,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
and the criteria for other strategic importance were 5%.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
We did the same for clothing trade, the same for furniture trade.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And now what did we get?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
We got that we have all the criteria in different conditional units,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
something in percents, and something in points.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Now we bring it all to a single indicator.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
That is, we bring all the percentages, all the points, all the conditions to the points.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
How does it work?

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
For example, it is clear that we have a share of turnover of 60%,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
one is 10%, the other is 30%.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
If we convert this into a five-point scale,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
then, accordingly, as an option,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
clothing trade could get 3 points,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
tea trading 1 point, furniture trade 2 points.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
This is also visible in the corresponding slide.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
Accordingly, if we sum up all the points in each direction

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
and divide them by the number of criteria,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
then we get just this very index of importance.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
For example, tea trading, which has 1 point in share of turnover,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
1 point in share of profit, 3 points in potential growth,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
and 5 points in other strategic importance,

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
in the end, we got 3 and 3 points in the index of importance.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
And according to the table, we see that the most important process is clothing trade.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
As for the following methods of comparison with the key factors of success,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
what is KFU?

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
In fact, these are the goals that are reflected in your strategic map of the company.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
These are the most important goals that you must achieve.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
As far as we remember,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
business processes are internal.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
Therefore, we look at KFU in the perspective of finance and marketing.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
The most important goals that are mentioned there are KFU.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
Accordingly, we mention all these goals.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Do not take more than 7-8-10,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
because if you take 20-30-40-50,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
firstly, there will not be so many of them in the map,

09:14.000 --> 09:23.000
and secondly, it is difficult for experts to assess business processes,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
especially if there are more than 5-6 of them,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
according to 10, 20, 30 criteria.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Therefore, choose 10 main ones.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
The table is also inserted.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
This is also visible on the corresponding slide,

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
where the table of the method of calculation of the index of importance is written.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
Accordingly, we list the business processes that we describe

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
and the critical success factors.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
These are the goals from the perspective of marketing and finance.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
We also assess,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
conditionally speaking,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
by points,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
how important the business process is,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
according to each criterion.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
For this, we use the same absolute experts.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Everything is the same.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
The accuracy will be even greater here,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
because there are even more criteria,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
and they are directly related to the strategy

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
that absolutely everyone signed up for,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
including the general director.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Therefore, this method is the most accurate.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
If you want to clarify it even more,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
please weigh these criteria.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
How is it done?

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
If in the third method we just take all the KFU

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
and set the points,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
how much this process takes for each KFU,

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
then in the fourth method we assign a certain weight to each KFU.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
How important is the KFU itself?

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
In principle, the sum of all KFU must be, of course, one.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
These are ordinary mathematical requirements.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
Therefore, first we assign a weight to each KFU,

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
then we add this weight to our table,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
and then we calculate the final index of importance of each process.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
We multiply the weight of the KFU by the point,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
which is assigned to this KFU for this process.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Again, the weight per point, the weight per point, and so on.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
This is also visible in a specific slide,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
this is a method of weighting processes with KFU.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Therefore, in the end, this is a very detailed, very clear

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
and as close as possible to the ideal

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
method of calculating the index of importance of a particular business process.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
But you should understand that this takes much more time

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
than a simple expert assessment.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Because first, the experts need to agree on the weighting of these criteria,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
then they need to agree on the points,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
and then calculate the index of importance.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
If you have a lot of experts, and everyone has their own vision

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
about the weight of the criteria, about what point should be assigned

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
to the process according to each criterion,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
you will almost never find a compromise,

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
and this is the most difficult method from the point of view of implementation.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Therefore, here you need to choose the golden mean.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Sometimes, and most often, two or three methods are enough.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
That is, either you develop the criteria of importance for yourself,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
or, what is better, three methods,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
when you just take specific goals from the perspective of marketing and finance

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
and score them for each business process.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
No need for extra complexity, although if you want more accuracy, please.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Expert assessment is if you want to conduct an express analysis.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
If you don't want to, if you want more accuracy,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
then it is better to refuse this method.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
So, we have assessed the importance of business processes.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Here, business processes are analyzed, as I said,

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
that is, scanned from the top level to the bottom.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
That is, at the very first stage, we assess the importance of business processes of the top level.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
Therefore, your assessment table will have 20, well, 20 plus or minus 5 business processes of the top level.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
When you assess them, go to the next point,

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
this is the assessment of the problem of business processes for the organization.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
What is the problem?

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
The problem is how different this particular business process is from the state as it should be.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
We don't consider how important it is strategically,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
how difficult it is to change it,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
we just abstract from all other criteria.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
We remove the importance, we remove the possibility of change,

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
just the problem, how it is, well, if you want, harmful,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
how much it needs to be changed.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
And the same four methods, expert assessment,

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
development of problem criteria, simple assessment of problems and weighted assessment of problems.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
The same is true for expert assessment.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Absolutely the same experts, but only instead of a questionnaire for importance,

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
you give them a questionnaire for problems and explain what problem is.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Here it is even more complicated than with importance,

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
because for importance they can at least be guided by the company's strategy.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
For problems, it is only their vision, how they see the process, how they would like it to work.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
That is, it is even more inaccuracy, it is even less point of contact,

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
because it is difficult for every expert to ask what he meant by the state of the process as it should be.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
Therefore, expert assessment here is very, very inaccurate, although very fast.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
If we talk about the development of problem criteria,

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
then here is absolutely the same as with the criteria for importance.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Take some basic criteria, most often what criteria?

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Financial, temporary, human difficulties, and so on.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
For example, if we took the business process of the company Evrika,

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
well, for example, the same thing, tea trading,

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
we could take as one criterion, for example, the interaction between the participants of the process,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
it is problematic, and unanimously it would be accepted as 5,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
because the participants do not know at all who is doing what.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
The second criterion, well, for example, could be information support of the process.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
Is there, no, if there is, then how high-quality it is,

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
how it satisfies the requirements of this process.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
Well, let's say 4, that is, there is, but it is very bad, and therefore an upgrade is required.

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
As for another criterion, well, let's say we take the transparency and controllability of the process.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Let's say, with this, well, the problem is on average, as in the company, well, 2.5-3 points.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
That is, in general, not everything is clear, not everything is transparent,

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
but somehow it works, and in general, there are no strong problems there.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
The same thing, in the corresponding table, we write all business processes,

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
all criteria and points that the process receives according to each criterion.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
We add everything up, divide by the number of criteria and get the index of the problem.

16:30.000 --> 16:40.000
Well, for example, as our company Evrica, let's look at the criteria of the problem that could be allocated.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
For example, the share of the cost of the process from the total expenses of the company,

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
how much this process will be spent, then the share of failures in the implementation of the process,

16:50.000 --> 16:59.000
how many complaints, how many complaints, how many negative reviews from other participants.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
Further, the degree of fragmentation of the process, how many transitions from one employee to another during this business process.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And the satisfaction of the client with this process.

17:11.000 --> 17:18.000
This is a non-nullifier, you can use more criteria, you can use other criteria, this is an option.

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
Accordingly, let's turn to the corresponding slide, an example of the results of calculating the index of the problem.

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
Let's say, in our tea trade, the cost is 10%, the failure rate is also 10%,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
the fragmentation rate is 100%, it is a very fragmented business process,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
the satisfaction of the client is 85%.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
It is clear that the share of the cost is a fairly accurate indicator, the share of failures is also quite accurate.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
The degree of fragmentation is a little less accurate, but nevertheless quite accurate.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
The satisfaction of the client is partly an expert indicator, so nothing is based on experts here.

17:58.000 --> 18:08.000
So, we evaluate all business processes, then we translate everything into points, as we remember, and calculate the index of the problem.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
All points were summed up, divided into a number of criteria, and we got the result.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So, again, clothing trade is in the leaders.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The most problematic process.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
This calculation is also seen on the corresponding slide.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
How can you assess the problem of business processes?

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
You can give a certain note to the experts you will use to assess the problem.

18:36.000 --> 18:45.000
For example, if you use a 5-point system, then you can write a note to them,

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
what does 1 mean, what does 2 mean, what does 3 mean, what does 4 mean, what does 5 mean.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
If in the event of an important problem, it is clear that 1 is the least important,

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
the 5-point process is very important, then in the event of a problem, 1 point is all great,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
and in the event of 5 points, everything is bad.

19:03.000 --> 19:12.000
The example of how you could write it, for example, depends on you, on your creativity,

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
on how much it is required by the experts you will work with.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
For example, you can also look at the corresponding slide if you want.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
Therefore, if we move on to other methods, 3 and 4, then, accordingly,

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
this is absolutely the same as in the case of importance.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
The only thing, as I will repeat again, we cannot use strategy,

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
because we do not assess the problem on the basis of a strategic map,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
not on the basis of a calculation map, not on the basis of a strategy.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
We must use some criteria for identifying the problems of processes.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
In order to determine specific problems of processes,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
many, many possible methods are used.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Special graphs of connections, special diagrams,

20:08.000 --> 20:16.000
special methods of identifying the causes of the investigation,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
the problems of the company.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
In fact, this can be seen using a flip chart.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
As I said, the causes and consequences of the problems are very difficult to understand,

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
especially if you do it intuitively, without preliminary preparation.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Therefore, when we assess the problem of the process,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
and when we do not have a strategy to rely on,

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
we must identify all the problems that are associated with this particular process to the maximum.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
Then we assess the criteria, assess the specific points,

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
and already see what problem this process is dealing with.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
For example, we take a specific diagram of the ICKV,

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
one of the options for assessing the causes and consequences of the connection for a specific business process.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
For example, this is a business process called the purchase.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Here is the main problem.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
It was identified by all the experts at once, that it is long, long-lasting,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
that all the materials are ordered for too long,

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
that all the possible goods, services, and so on are ordered for too long.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
It all happens for too long.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It would be better to do it faster.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
It is difficult to name all the causes of why this is happening at once

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
and to deduce the rest of the problems of this particular process.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
It is very difficult without preparation.

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
Therefore, in order to identify them, a so-called brainstorming is arranged.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
All the experts we have already identified,

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
they determine and help to establish the main problems

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
that are the reason for this main problem.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
All the participants and experts discuss what could cause this problem,

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
and then, as a result, real problems appear on the diagram,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
which really have a place to be.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
For example, in this particular business process, there are problems with automation,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
there are serious difficulties with the qualification of the staff,

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
there are problems with the relationship with suppliers, there are other problems.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
When we identify these problems, we imagine them as a so-called Christmas tree

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
or a fish skeleton, so to speak.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Therefore, this is the second name of this program.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
When we write all the possible problems, we put the connecting lines,

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
and this means that they are the reasons for the appearance

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
of this main problem.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
Accordingly, there are other options of diagrams.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Use the one you like the most, the one that is most understandable to you.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
You don't have to use such arrows, you can put connections between different problems,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
just throw a few problems that come to mind in this process at once.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
From them, put the arrows, why they arise.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
This will help you to identify new problems.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
You don't have to go too deep, you don't have to spend more time on it than you need,

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
but nevertheless, using the example of the purchase process,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
you can immediately identify one subtlety,

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
and now all the experts, having gathered together,

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
were able to identify additional difficulties, additional problems.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
There may be more of them, there may be much more, but these will be the main ones.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
And all these problems will be listed in a special table.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
This is called mapping problems and dependencies.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
You write all the possible problems in the picture, horizontally and vertically,

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
and you put how they are connected to each other,

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
how they affect each other.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
The most basic, the most influential on the overall big problem of complexity,

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
they will be the criteria for assessing the complexity of the whole process.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
For example, we see that in general, this is not such a significant problem,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
this is more significant, this is generally the problem number one, as it turned out.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Therefore, we can arrange all the identified problems,

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
and only the most basic of them should be left,

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
and it is on them that we assess the complexity of the process.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
When you assess all these problems,

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
when you weigh which of them are the most basic,

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
the most significant for the development of the business process,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
we can imagine it as a table.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
The business process, next to it will be specific problems,

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
the most important ones that we have identified here.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
And then the index of the complexity.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
The index of the complexity can be the number of problems that have come to this business process.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
This will be the third method.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
That is, the more problems we have identified, the more complex they will be.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
For example, for our purchase business process,

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
for which we identified the problem of duration,

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
the main problem now is the interaction with suppliers.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
This means that opposite this process, we will write the problem of duration and interaction with suppliers,

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
and the index of the complexity will be two.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
And if this problem or this one were also relevant,

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
we would also put them, put the index four.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
And then we will say, well, they are all different,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
still, by force they are different, no need to divide all the problems into only important and not important.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Less important and more important.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Absolutely right, but this is already the fourth method,

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
when we assign force to each problem, so-called.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
That is, this is an analog of weight for the criterion of importance.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And we assign force to each problem on a scale from one to five,

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
and then we make an index of the complexity.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Well, for example, here we have the duration of the process,

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
it will have a force of five, because this is generally a big problem,

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
its weight will be, well, let's say, 0.5.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
Here, in this problem, the force will be, let's say, four,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
the weight is 0.4.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
Well, let's say, this one has a weight of 0.1 and a force of 2.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
5 to 0.5, 4 to 0.4, 0.1 to 1.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
And putting it all together, we get the index of the complexity of the business process of the purchase.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
As in the case of the method of assessing importance,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
the fourth way of assessing the complexity is laborious.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
You, again, all experts need to agree on what problems are the most important,

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
what problems are the strongest, the most serious.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
To determine them by a list, by force, by weight,

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
and only then calculate the index of the complexity.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
This is a very laborious process, although it is more reliable than all the others,

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
but before you start this method, think about whether you need to make so much effort,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
if for some business processes the problems are already, in principle, clear,

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
they do not need to be reaffirmed again.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
If you want to learn more about this fourth method,

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
you can refer to the corresponding slide, where the example of the index of the complexity of processes,

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
the interaction of weight and force, and the final calculation for this index are written.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
How else can you assess how important,

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
how problematic this particular business process is?

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
For this, you can use not only your brainstorming,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
which will help you draw a similar diagram,

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
but you can also use the help of a computer,

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
but you can also use the help of a computer,

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
and use such a tool as benchmarking.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Here you assess only your inner vision of your problems,

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
but an absolutely similar scheme can be developed taking into account your competitors.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
For example, what is benchmarking?

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
This is a comparison of a particular business process

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
with a so-called benchmark.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
As a benchmark, the business process of your competitor may be inferior.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
For example, you are a construction company,

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
and the business process of your closest competitor is of another construction company.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
This can be an internal benchmarking,

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
that is, you compare this business process

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
with the benchmarking process inside your company.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
If you imagine it all schematically,

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
it will be a kind of a few rings.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
The main thing you should start with

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
is the internal benchmarking.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
You should first look at the best practice of your company.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Maybe your employees already know

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
how to deal with such problems better,

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
what processes should be ideally in terms of duration,

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
cost, etc.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
For example, if we take the company Evrica,

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
which has a business process of tea, clothing and furniture trading,

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
we can easily determine how much it costs to buy tea, furniture and clothes.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
Of course, the cost and time will be different,

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
but nevertheless, the best experience should be taken from one process to another.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
This is internal benchmarking.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
If we do not find a good experience in our company,

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
we move on to competitive benchmarking.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
How do the closest competitors do it?

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
It is clear that you will not come to a competing company and ask how you do it.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
There is an inside, there is a study of the experience of competitors

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
based on the media, forums, the Internet, etc.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
If there is no good experience there for one reason or another,

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
you can ask the representatives of the similar industry.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
Maybe it's not a construction company,

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
but a development company that develops real estate.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
This is not a close competitor, but from the same field.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
For example, real estate development.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
If there are no good benchmarks,

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
how should your business process look like?

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
You should do a general benchmarking

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
and see how all the companies you know,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
have heard and can contact, how they do it.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
Why do you need to study this benchmark?

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
In order to understand how ideally this process is done

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
and how it works for you.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
And in order to understand how problematic it is for you,

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
you need to compare it with the benchmark of your industry.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
When you find this ideal,

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
you compare it with what you have.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
You will use this scheme,

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
you will determine the reasons why you should not have this ideal.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Only after that you will be able to make such a scheme

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
and based on this scheme you can determine the problem of your business process.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
If we talk about specific types of benchmarking,

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
which you can use to determine how ideal your business process should be,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
the one you evaluate,

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
here you can use all types of benchmarking.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
Internal, competitive, functional, i.e. industry and general benchmarking.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
But remember one thing,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
that most often, according to experience,

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
it is very difficult to find a perfect benchmark.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
For example, when we worked with one construction company,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
the problems that were associated with construction

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
and the operation of objects were in all parameters.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
That is, the main business areas were

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
shopping centers and business centers,

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
that is, office centers.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
And there was the study of the object,

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
the construction of the object and the submission to operation.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
Then the same company operated this object,

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
that is, it was a lender.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
We analyzed the business process for shopping centers.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
Of course, we immediately went to look at the company's experience

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
in the field of office centers and came to the conclusion that there were the same problems.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
But it is not so that one department is good at everything,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
and the other department is not good at anything.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Most often, the departments exchange experience.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
And most often, everything is at the same level.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Something interesting can be found in other departments,

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
but usually the experience is the same.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
Therefore, it is better to focus on competitors,

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
on the experience of the company from your industry and on the world experience in this area.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
We also recommended this particular construction and development company.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
We looked at the experience of other developers,

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
we looked at the experience of construction companies that did not deal with further operation of objects.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
We looked at the world experience in terms of problems in trading,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
for example, in the submission of office premises, and so on.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
And only then it was possible to identify the problems

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
and to deal with the operation of these premises

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
so that the maximum number of premises was submitted at minimum marketing costs, and so on.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
If we talk about the problem,

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
then everything is clear here.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
This is, again, an expert assessment.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
Either we choose specific criteria,

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
or we are looking for problems that separate our process from the standard,

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
or we are looking for problems that are on the way to the ideal.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
And by the number of problems, by their strength and weight,

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
in some cases, we assess how problematic the business process is.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
So, we assessed the importance of processes,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
we assessed the problematicness of processes,

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
yes, it was more difficult.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
Now there is one last third step left,

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
and that is to determine the capacity of the process.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
That is, how many resources are needed to change this process.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
That is, to transfer the state as it is,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
that is, to bring it closer to the standard.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
How can this be done?

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
Based on the experience of assessing the problematicness of the business process,

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
we can know what kind of business process we have now

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
and what problems we have.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
And now, when we assess the resource capacity,

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
we must understand how much it will cost us to solve all these problems.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
How much it costs, I'm not just talking about money.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
It's time, it's money, it's some kind of moral and psychological difficulties,

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
it can be absolutely anything.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
But most often, financial problems,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
psychological problems, although this is an inextricable principle.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
And here, most often, only two methods are used.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
The first is an expert assessment, and the second is the development of the criteria for the resource capacity.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
Let's take a closer look at them.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
So, let's say we have the same purchase process

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
that we assessed on the flip chart.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
It is clear that we have highlighted that it has many problems.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
We have highlighted two main ones, the duration and the problems in relation to the suppliers.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Now we need to assess how much it costs us to solve them.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
Let's say we invited several experts.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
These are the experts of this process, managers,

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
the head of the procurement department, the supplier,

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
the client of this process,

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
that is, for example, the representative of the production department.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
The experts should assess what resources are needed

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
to change this particular process,

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
and assess in points how much resources are needed to change something.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Again, we use the five-point scale.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
If the experts think that everything is necessary to change the suppliers,

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
to introduce a new IT system,

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
to change the interaction with the suppliers,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
to fill the procurement process,

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
then, of course, the resource capacity is 5.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
Let's say one of the experts thinks that everything is not so bad,

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
that the procurement process can be changed a little,

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
let's say, he will put 3.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Someone else decided that everything is bad, but not too bad, so he put 4.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
The more points, the more resources are needed to change the process.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
We divide the assessment into the number of experts and get something in the middle.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
How many points does this resource capacity of this process take?

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
Again, this is not accurate, as any expert assessment.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
Therefore, we recommend using the development of the criteria for the resource capacity.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
As I said, the main criteria are cost, time, and resistance, psychological factor.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
Usually, they are the same,

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
that is, time, money, people, and the process.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
This is all standard for all companies.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
You just have to calculate approximately,

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
how much money,

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
how much time you need to get from the state as it is to the ideal,

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
and how much people will resist these changes.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
The second, the first, that is, cost and time can be approximately predicted.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
Not necessarily accurate, but at least approximately, to evaluate in points.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
But as for the resistance, it is difficult to assess it all.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
To do this, you can use questionnaires, surveyors,

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
invite a psychologist to the organization in order to conduct an interview

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
with those employees who will be affected by this change,

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
and assess the strength of resistance.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Therefore, when we talk about all the costs,

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
which will be associated with the change of this particular business process,

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
always highlight the disposable costs,

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
that is, once you need to finance, for example, the purchase of an ERP system,

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
or once you need to attract a psychologist,

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
or once you need to raise the salary,

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
well, some bonus, for example, you will not raise the salary, but you will give a bonus.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
These are disposable costs.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
Then there are those that will appear, will increase the current costs,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
and will not end at one point, but will continue further.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
For example, the attraction of new high-class specialists,

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
the salary will increase, or the introduction of an ERP system,

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
in addition to disposable costs, will bring with it support for the ERP system,

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
and additional money, and so on.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Therefore, at the stage of assessing the resource capacity,

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
you need to assess all the costs that will be associated with

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
the change of this particular business process.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
Therefore, when we talk about finances and time,

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
it is all very accurate.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
When we talk about the strength of resistance from the people,

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
yes, surveyors, some interviews, attraction of psychologists, and so on,

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
try to identify the main sources of resistance,

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
that is, the hidden and the most open ones,

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
those who are against this resistance,

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
understand why, for example, a person is against changes.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Maybe it can be motivated somehow,

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
maybe this resistance can be somehow reduced, lowered, or even leveled.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
And in the end, when we determine all the resources

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
that we need to move from a state to another,

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
to a state as it should be,

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
we can imagine on a kind of graph,

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
where there will be a probability of these resistance and cost,

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
we can determine those resources

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
that are very likely to shoot out,

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
and which will cost the most,

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
let's say, the amount.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
For example, we have determined that we will need to attract a psychologist,

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
we will need to conduct a lot of interviews with employees,

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
to fight psychological resistance.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
We will need a lot of time to, for example,

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
to implement the ERP system, to find,

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
that is, it means attending seminars with our employees,

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
and we will need additional money and time for this.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
This means that our employees, instead of doing their normal work,

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
will have to pay additional salary.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
If we talk about financial costs,

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
then we add the cost of the ERP system,

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
the cost of its maintenance, the cost of installation, and so on.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
From all these resources, we determine those that are most likely to happen.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
That is, maybe our resistance

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
is not as strong as we expected,

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
and we will have to hire special psychologists,

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
conduct special investigative events, and spend additional money on this.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
Maybe we won't need it.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
But, for example, the purchase of ERP is almost 100% required.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
And so, if we talk about the criteria for the resource capacity,

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
then the most likely resources that will be required

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
to make changes will be the main criteria.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
For example, in our case, it is the purchase of ERP,

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
it is the maintenance of ERP, and it is the choice of ERP system

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
for our procurement department.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
Therefore, these resources, financial and temporary,

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
will be used to assess the resource capacity

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
and change of this process.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
Therefore, when we fill in the corresponding table,

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
we can find the form of this table on the corresponding slide of the questionnaire,

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
analysis of the resource capacity index and change of the process.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
Accordingly, we write the criteria for the first financial costs for ERP,

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
the criteria for the second temporary costs for ERP,

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
the criteria for the third temporary costs for the psychologist's search,

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
and so on, and so on, and so on.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
And then we write the points.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
If the costs are very significant, we put a five.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
If the costs for the psychologist's search are small,

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
then we put a one, and so on.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
So, we put it opposite to each process that we analyze.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
And in the end, when we put all the points on all the criteria,

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
divide by the number of criteria, we get the resource capacity index,

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
again from one to five.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
And the weight of the criteria.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
Again, multiply the point assigned to this criterion by its weight,

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
0.1, 0.2, 0.7.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
This will give additional complexity, but additional accuracy.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
This is a subtype of this method.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
An example of calculating the resource capacity index taking into account the weight

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
can also be found on the corresponding slide.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
So, we have evaluated the importance of processes, their complexity,

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
and the resource capacity.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
What should we do next?

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
We can develop a business process arrangement matrix

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
when we put the complexity index horizontally,

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
and the importance index vertically.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
And the more important the process is,

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
the more complex it is.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
So, we will optimize these processes first.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
Those that are medium-important and medium-complex

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
are number two in the optimization queue.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
Those that are low-important and low-complex are number three.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
We should not deal with them yet, because they are not primary.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
Nevertheless, I would like to note that

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
business processes that are now the most important and the most complex

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
become less important and less complex after optimization.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
This means that the process of business optimization is not a project,

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
but a process. It happens constantly.

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
We should not optimize and forget about it for 5-10 years.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
No, it should happen constantly and in a mandatory order.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
You can also choose business processes

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
from the top 5 or 10 for optimization

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
and use a special table.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
For example, you write all the business processes that you have assessed.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
You write the importance index of a particular business process.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
You write the complexity index and the possibility index of making changes.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
I want to note that the possibility index of making changes

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
is directly opposite to the resource capacity index that we have calculated.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
The 6th one is your resource capacity index.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
Now we add the importance, complexity and possibility of making changes

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
to each process.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
The larger the sum that we get in the end,

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
the more important this process is for optimization.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Usually, about 10 processes,

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
no more than that, are taken for optimization.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
It is impossible to optimize all of them at once.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
It is because they are connected to each other.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
It means that if you change one business process,

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
you change another one, and so on.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
If you change 10 processes in parallel,

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
you have a mutual influence of business processes.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
You cannot monitor all the changes

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
and, as a result, you optimize something in one process

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
and you make something worse in another one.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the interaction of business processes with each other

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
and to choose no more than 3-4 processes for optimization.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
3-4 processes are what can be monitored

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
in terms of mutual influence and influence of other processes on them.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
You will have time to optimize all your processes.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
You will not have to hurry and take everything at once.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
You will have time to optimize them in a qualitative way.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
For example, we had a client, a trading organization,

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
which after diagnosing business processes,

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
evaluating their importance, problem-solving and capacity resources,

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
got a list of top 10 business processes

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
out of 21 business processes of the highest level.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
Of course, there were the main business processes,

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
and she decided that she needed to optimize everything immediately,

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
urgently, quickly, within half a year.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
We tried to convince her that this was impossible to do

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
simply because the processes influenced each other.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
After changing something in the process of buying,

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
they automatically had to change something in the process of IT,

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
and after changing something in the process of accounting,

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
they had to change something in the process of accounting

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
and outsourcing.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
In general, marketing then influenced the purchase,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
sales, and so on.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
At the same time, all 10 processes could not be changed.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
Therefore, we persuaded the client to stay on 3 main business processes.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
The rest of them should be left for later.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
That's why the final step, when you have analyzed all 3 parameters,

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
and highlighted the top 10 most important,

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
problem-solving and less resource-intensive business processes,

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
is to make a final table,

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
where you will find business processes

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
chosen for initial optimization,

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
specific steps and actions,

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
For example, for this trading organization,

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
we made a similar table,

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
and there were business processes in the purchase plan,

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
i.e. the implementation of EBC accounting,

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
the implementation of a new automated order system,

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
the implementation of new fields in relation to suppliers,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
and so on.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
In the case of the sales process,

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
additional control for the clients was automatically introduced,

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
i.e. they did not have a CRM system.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
It was necessary to implement a CRM system,

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
to work out a plan of events and seminars for their clients,

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
to re-examine the value-added policy, and so on.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
Thus, we made a specific table,

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
and we wrote down the specific events,

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
and the time needed to be implemented.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
Again, the time should not be specified,

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
as it is necessary to specify half a year,

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
or a year, or the next year,

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
or the next quarter, and so on.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
It is necessary to estimate the plan of events,

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
and to tie the information of all processes to each other.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
Then it will allow you to manage 3-4 processes at the same time.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
Now let's move on to the next section.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
If we are going to manage our business processes,

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
we will inevitably need criteria to determine

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
whether we achieve our goals in optimizing processes or not.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
To understand this, we need the key indicators of business process effectiveness,

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
or KPI.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
KPI is a way of controlling business processes,

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
a way of assessing its effectiveness.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
If we classify KPI,

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
we can break it down by time.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
For example, it can be the final and operational indicators.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
If we take the business process of sales,

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
the final indicator will be the volume of sales per year,

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
and the operational one will be the volume of sales per quarter.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
If we talk about the classification of KPI indicators,

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
we can classify them as aggregate or detailed.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Aggregate is the total satisfaction of the consumer,

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
and detailed is the volume of revenue.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
The reason for the KPI is related to the time of the business process.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
It is very important to know the type of indicators.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
It is important not only to be able to measure the final indicator,

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
but also to track its performance.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
To track the KPI,

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
we need both the operational and the KPI.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
For example, we have a business process of sales.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
The KPI will be the volume of sales per year.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
The KPI will be the volume of sales per year.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
The KPI will be the volume of sales per year.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
The more the manager communicates with the clients,

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
the higher the probability that he will sell more.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
These KPI will help you to signal in advance

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
that there is a problem in the implementation of the business process.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
Everything is not going according to plan,

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
there may be a failure.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
To avoid failure, it is easier to track in advance

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
and use some adjustments.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
The KPI is divided into priority and regular.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
If the business process is prioritized,

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
then the time of the process will be prioritized.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
But we should not forget

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
that all indicators should be balanced.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
If you reduce the time of the process

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
in order not to lose quality

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
and not to increase the cost of the business process,

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
you should add certain indicators.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
For example, the quality indicator and the cost of the business process.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
These are the usual indicators.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
Now they have no problems.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
Now everything is OK with the cost and quality.

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
But in the future, when you start to reduce the time of the business process,

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
you will sacrifice the quality to reduce the time.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Then the quality will become the priority KPI.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
The level of management of the KPI is divided into the upper and lower levels.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
The explanation is unnecessary.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
The upper level is used for the business process,

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
and the lower level is used for the lower level.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
If we talk about aggregated KPI,

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
I want to note the following.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
There are indicators that are very difficult to measure.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
For example, the satisfaction of customers.

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
How to measure it?

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
You can't go to a client with a questionnaire and ask him to say OK or not OK.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
In fact, the satisfaction of the consumer,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
the satisfaction of your clients,

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
and the satisfaction of the customer itself.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
The number of complaints from the clients

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
compared to the previous period.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
The number of requests for one client compared to the previous period.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
The number of client requests.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
The satisfaction of the client,

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
the expert assessment of the client.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
The number of requests for one client compared to the previous period.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
You can measure each such indicator clearly.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
Except for the expert assessment, of course.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
When you measure it all in detail,

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
you can bring each indicator to the same points,

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
assign it a weight, for example, the volume of revenue is very important for you,

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
the expert assessment of the buyer is not so important for you,

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
you assign a weight, points,

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
and in the end you get an aggregate indicator of satisfaction,

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
which consists of four indicators.

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
As a result, you can't say that it's all just an expert assessment,

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
you have a clear indicator that you can rely on in the future.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
If I have already talked about clear and accurate indicators,

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
let's see what kinds of indicators exist in general.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
It can be absolute numbers, for example, the number of calls.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
It can be the ratio of sales volume this year to the previous year.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
It can be indexes.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
It can be percentages, ratings, anything.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
It can be points, it can be just some description,

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
that is, good, bad, not very good, like it, don't like it.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
It can be a qualitative description,

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
like I just said.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
It all depends on what kind of indicator it is,

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
who, let's say, and what is analyzed,

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
and what goal you want to achieve.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
For example, if you evaluate the accuracy of your device,

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
then, of course, accurate ratings will suit you.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
If you evaluate the satisfaction of customers,

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
then you will find discrete descriptive indicators.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
For example, it will be convenient for the customer to write whether he is satisfied or not,

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
agree or disagree, or according to some score system,

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
for example, from minus 3 to plus 3, or from minus 5 to plus 5,

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
put a specific point of satisfaction for your products.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
It is very important to include a minus scale,

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
because if you include a scale from 0 to plus,

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
then your customer is strongly dissatisfied with something in your product.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
Therefore, you need to include a minus, and in the same proportion as a plus.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
That is, if there is a plus 5 points, then there should be a minus 5 points,

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
and only then you can track the bright dissatisfaction of your customer.

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
As an example of indicators,

59:19.000 --> 59:23.000
in addition to what I have already mentioned,

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
you can name delivery time, development time,

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
cycle duration, and so on.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
There are many indicators, there are no typical ones,

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
they must be developed, and they must be developed,

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
including the owners of the processes, all participants and customers, suppliers of each process.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
Let's consider some basic indicators of business processes,

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
so that there is some structure,

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
how to approach the development of indicators of KPI and business processes.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
There is a business process resultivity,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
that is, you evaluate the result of the process,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
its quantity, its characteristics,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
the satisfaction of your client,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
that is, you evaluate the outcome of the process.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
The cost of the business process, you evaluate the costs that your company carries

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
when performing this business process.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
The quality of the business process is the most difficult indicator,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
because it is always unique for each process,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
there is no single recipe for evaluating the quality of the business process.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
These are indicators that will help you develop KPI for absolutely any process.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Additionally, you can also include such an indicator as fragmentation,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
for example, or the number of business processes.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
These are not necessary indicators,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
because they are not necessary to improve your knowledge about the business process.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But you should not consider them as primary indicators,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
because they are additional, not the most important.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You need to rely on them, but you should not be guided by them.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
If I said what is fragmentation,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
what is it?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
It is an indicator that compares functional transitions,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
transitions from one function to another function within one business process,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
and organizational breaks.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You can see the example on the slide of the degree of organizational fragmentation of processes.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
We compare functional transitions and organizational breaks.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
The more functional transitions and organizational breaks,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
the more fragmentation.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
You can ask, what is bad?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
All the work in the company is bad.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Therefore, it is an additional indicator,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
in addition to all the main indicators that I listed.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Result, time, cost and quality.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
This will help you understand the necessary fragmentation of business processes.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
When you have identified the problems with the main indicators,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
refer to the fragmentation.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
The second indicator is the additional cost of business processes.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Maybe there are additional costs, additional time.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Of course, if there is additional time,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
there is an additional cost of business processes.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And sometimes it is completely unreasonable.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
If we talk about the number of business processes,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
it means that, imagine a company.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
The company is engaged in the field of trade.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
It supplies components to windows, doors, furniture.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It happens most often,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
at least it happened so,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
that the buyer gets one part of the windows,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
then brings the windows,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
then brings all the necessary documentation.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
This is the first time, and more.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
At first, we did not pay much attention to this.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And then, when consultants were invited,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
it was decided that this indicator only indicates that the process is not optimal.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It is quite possible to do everything at once.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
All the documentation, all the windows, all the frames,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
and all together.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
The number of exits indicates that any client strives for the principle of one window.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
He came and got everything at once.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
He does not need to go for this, then for this, then for this, then for this.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Of course, this is not always possible,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
so I repeat that the indicator is additional.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
How will we choose KPI for our business processes?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
After all, you can make a huge list of KPI for any process.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
How will you navigate in the future?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
First, let's remember our strategy.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Let's remember the strategic accounting map of the company,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and your department.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
This is what you need to focus on.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
The most important and key problems described in the strategy,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
the most important strategic goals,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and the most important indicators to achieve the strategic goals outlined in the company.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Next.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
We had one client who decided to introduce such a KPI

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
as a lost benefit of the company.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
The indicator is good.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It was listed in the business process map,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
but it was not known how to measure it.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
There is an indicator, but there is no measurement method.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
It is better not to introduce such indicators,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
because you will not be able to measure them,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
and they will not be useful to you.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Yes, it is a great indicator, but if there is no method,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
postpone it until the method appears.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
When we talk about KPI, it should be available.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
For example, the ratio of your business process time,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
for example, the purchase time of your business process from competitors.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It is a great indicator, but why not use it?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Where do you take this time from your competitors?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
If you do not have the appropriate channels, probably not.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Therefore, no matter how great the KPI is,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
you should not have such a KPI.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
You should not have such a KPI,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
which will include a lot of additional indicators,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and as a result, you will get confused

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
what to multiply and what to divide.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
As a result, your KPI will be considered

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
with a large number of errors.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Therefore, do not complicate the calculation of the KPI.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
You should be sure that the owner of the business process

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
can influence this KPI.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
For example, one client introduced a KPI

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
called increasing the financial literacy

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
of managers who worked with clients,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
that is, sellers.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
All this is great, but in the sales department

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
the owner of the business process

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
did not do this.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And no one knew what documents to take from clients,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
where to carry them in terms of primary documentation,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
what terms, what information to provide to the accounting department.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Therefore, it was impossible to introduce such a KPI

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
to this business process.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The next point is the limited number of KPIs.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It is imperative to monitor the number of KPIs

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
for one process.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
If you have 100 KPIs for each process,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
then the process of accounting for business processes

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
will take so much time

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
that it will not be paid off by any business process optimization.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Usually, each process has no more than 5-7 KPIs.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And balance is what I have already said.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
If you introduce KPIs for minimizing time,

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
then you must balance it with quality and value.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
In other words, there should not be any side-effects.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You should be sure that the process is improving

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
not due to the deterioration of some other indicators,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
but due to the fact that the process is improving.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
For example, we had one client.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
She was engaged in audio-video production.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And there was such a wonderful example.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
They wanted to reduce costs on glass storage,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
so they decided to deliver goods at night.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So that the cars would not be stuck.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But the staff refused to go out at night

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
for obvious reasons.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
So they had to pay additional costs.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
As a result, they reduced the cost of glass storage,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
but at the same time they increased the costs for the staff.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
As a result, the effect was not even zero,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
but negative.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So, the KPIs should be balanced.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
What criteria do you use to choose the indicators

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
you will focus on?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It's very simple.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
You evaluate the importance of a given KPI

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
in accordance with the strategy of the company

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and the accounting cards of the company and your department.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Then you can evaluate the problem of this KPI.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
You can see how much this KPI is now

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
and how much you would like it to be.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
For this, you should look at the methodology

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
of evaluating the problem of the business process.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
The most problematic and important KPIs

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
should remain in the arsenal for managing a specific process.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Therefore, when you have selected the best KPIs,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000
you can freely, in addition to the regulations,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
write a page where the KPI indicator card

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
will be included.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
This means that you write in each process

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
what KPIs will allow you to measure the efficiency

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
of the business process.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
In each process, you will write

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
how it is calculated,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
who is responsible for collecting this information,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
in what units it is measured,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
what department is responsible for calculating the indicator,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
what is the value of the indicator,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
what is the plan, where the information is collected,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and so on.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
You can see the indicator card on the corresponding slide.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Therefore, if we talk about indicators,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
then in the regulations of each process they must be written.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And you must have a single dictionary,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
where all the KPIs used must be listed

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and this information must be provided.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
This can be provided

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
if it is some kind of information carrier,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
for example, a special program for accounting for KPIs.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It can be a certain DERIO-KPI,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
that is, KPIs of the upper level,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
which are typed under the KPI and reach the lowest level.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And then, when you click on a specific KPI,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
it will be easier to work with them.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Now we can move on to the next section,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
which is called the Regulating Documents of the Business Process.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
As I said, it is impossible to live without the Regulations.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Although few people like them,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
but they are useful,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
they are stored on shelves,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
no one knows about them and no one uses them.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
This situation can be fixed.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
When we went through the description of the business process,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
we worked on moving forward to the goal,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
to the benchmark for each business process.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
One day we will definitely achieve satisfactory results

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
for each process.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And then we can regulate this process.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Why regulate business processes?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Most often, people we meet

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
are new employees.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Or there is a controversial point,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
or it is necessary to change the current course of the business process.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
For these purposes, the Regulation is needed.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
It fixes a certain agreement

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
between employees and companies

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
on who behaves.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
This agreement is the tool

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
of the influence of the boss on his subordinates.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And what is written in the Regulation,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
the employee must do.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
If he does not do this,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
he does not comply with the agreement,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
and some punitive measures may be applied for this.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And he will not be able to comply with the Regulation.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
The Regulation will allow you to make your company transparent.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It will be clear who is responsible for what,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
what functions are responsible.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Regulations can be developed not only for specific employees,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
as is often the case.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
They are developed at the corporate level,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
then at the department level,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
and finally at the employees' level.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Therefore, Regulations are an integral part of the management process.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
What are Regulations?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I think that each of you has a certain Regulation.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Most often, 90% of cases,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
you have a structural Regulation.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
It is a kind of a system of regulations

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
that is defined by the department,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
by the employees, by the departments,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
by the departments,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
by the departments,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
by the departments,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
by the departments,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
by the departments.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Regulations are a kind of a system of rules

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
that allow everybody to understand

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
what processes are carried out in the company,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
on what conditions and on what rules they should be carried out.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
If a person comes to your company,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
he can freely familiarize himself with the business processes

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
and understand the scheme of how it will all happen

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
and for what purpose it will happen,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
because the result will be clear.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And then he will receive a specific instruction

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
on what he will do.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
This will be the structure of regulations.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Thus, the process regulation allows you to understand

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
the structure of the company.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
If we look at the structure of regulations in any company,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
let's say, we are talking about the structure of regulations,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
then the position in the organization is the highest level document.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Then the position in the department,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
then in the department, and then the official instruction.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
If we move on to the process system of management,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
we will see that there are three main structures for the process system of regulation.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The first one is the position on the business processes of the highest level.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Then the position on each business process,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
then the position on the operation, and so on.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Thus, the structure of regulations will allow us to understand

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
the role of a person in an organization or department,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
and the process one will help us understand the role of this action,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
the overall process of the organization.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Let's say, we have a position on the process of the highest level.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Here are described the inputs and outputs of the process,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
the responsible ones,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
and from which procedures this process consists,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
if we speak roughly.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Then we talk about each procedure that is included in this business process.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And only then we talk about specific small operations.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
If we talk about the mistakes that are most often made by those who start the business processes regulation.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Number one.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
The unreadability of documents.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
They are written in such a way that you don't want to do anything but cry when you look at them.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
You can only execute them from under the stick.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Therefore, the document must be readable.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Include schemes of business processes, normal interval,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
responsibilities, additional drawings.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It must be readable.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
The more we include in this document, the better.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It must be a clear structure and maximum usefulness for the user of this instruction or other regulations.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
The contradiction.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Very often, when we get acquainted with the documentation of a specific client,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
we see that the same function is being executed in different departments by completely different performers.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And when we come to a specific performer and ask him,

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
he usually answers,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I don't know where you got this instruction from, it's from the forgotten times.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Therefore, the instructions, all regulations must be mutually exclusive.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
If your business process is described in a certain way,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
and it is written that the responsibility for such a business process is such and such,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
then, accordingly, in the position of the department,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
it must be repeated that it is responsible for the business process that is being executed.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
The difference in the structure of the business process is not indicated in the process regulations,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
but in the fact that the structure of the business process is completely different.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
There must be a single system.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Next, the level of difference.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It is imperative to observe this hierarchy.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
If we are talking about structural regulations,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
then it is the position of the department, then departments, groups and the official instruction.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Then we will talk about processes, then about specific operations.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
No other way.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Next, if you have agreed to the regulations,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
if you have signed it with employees, with the department, and so on,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
you must know who will regulate the implementation of this regulation of your company.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
This is not what you wrote and put on the shelf,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
otherwise it will be the same fate as in the current documentation.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
You will have to ask them regularly to implement this specific regulation.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And for this control, you will need the same KPI that you have developed in the previous step.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
As a result, the documents must be used and used as effectively as possible.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
In other words, we have developed the situation as it should be in terms of business processes

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and in terms of the compliance of processes and structures.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
That is, we have ideally located the responsible and the executors,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
then we have created the process structure and the structural regulation,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
and then we start to implement it all and have a normal working organization at the output.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
If we list the main requirements for regulation,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
then it is imperative to set the level of regulation,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
again, to clearly specify the name of each regulation,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
for example, the status of the structure, the status of the department,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
the status of the department, the status of the official instruction.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Then it is imperative to define the typical structure of each document.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
It should not be that in one document we start from point 1,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
this is the role of this department, for example,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
or this unit of some other level in the general structure of the organization,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
then the list of names of those who enter there,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
then the general functions, then some rights and duties,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
then something else.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
It should be a single list, a single structure for all absolute regulations,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
no matter if it is structural or procedural.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
For structural, one regulation is a supplement, for procedural, another.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Further, a single style of regulation, that is, both structural and procedural regulations,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
they all should be written in a single style,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
not too sophisticated, but nevertheless quite simple to perceive in a formal style.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And then the regulation should occur exclusively in accordance with the descriptions of business processes.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Again, we remember that the processes are the primary,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
and the structure is later, therefore, first a procedural regulation is created,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
and only then a structural one.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Let's look at an example of what the business process situation looks like.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I will show you what to do in the following slide.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Let's go through the points.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
First, the general situation.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
The goal, why this regulation is needed, the application area, the definition term.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
The definition term must be mandatory,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
because it is necessary for everyone to understand what is being discussed and speak the same language.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Then there should be a description of the business process.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
The goal, all the work that is included in the business process, all the participants,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
the sequence of the work, and here, by the way, the scheme of the business process will be very relevant.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
The dates of the events that initiate this process,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
the dates of the events that end the business process,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
that is, what time they occur, how often,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
maybe once a month, once every six months, if there is such a thing.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
The duration of work, approximate, other characteristics.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Next, the KPI.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
The KPI is exactly those that we talked about.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
With links you can make a proposal for a specific indicator map of each.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Next, the responsibility for the implementation of the regulations.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
It is necessary to write who is responsible for the business process.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
It does not matter whether it is a business process,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
or an operation, or a business process of the upper level, or a structural regulation.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
The structures are approximately the same.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Next, the order of making changes in the business process.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
How to change the business process.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
How often, who is responsible for this.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
This must also be, because the situation, like any regulation, must be reviewed.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And the form of the documents.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
That is, in what form the owner of this business process will be reported on its work, its effectiveness.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000
You can also make a business process scheme in the application.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
For example, you can make a scheme for the implementation of the business process.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
You can make a scheme for the implementation of the business process.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
You can also make a business process scheme in the application.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
If you do not want to make them directly in the body of the regulation.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It is at your discretion.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Accordingly, in this way, in this way, in this way,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
absolutely any regulation is made.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Whether it is a business process of the upper level,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
just a business process, or some kind of operation.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
The main thing is in a single way.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Business process.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And now the most important part.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
For those who want to track the business process and its cost.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I am sure that in any company there is a accounting, a management accounting.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
In one way or another.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Now, with the transition to the process management system of companies,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
the interest in the ABC analysis is growing.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Activity-based costing.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
That is, the operating system of accounting for the company's costs.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
This means that all the costs of the company,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
no matter how constant or variable,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000
are attracted to each specific process.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And are taken into account in each specific process.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And you can say boldly how much each process costs.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
It does not matter whether it is a taxable expense or not.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
The main thing is that you can track the dynamics of each process,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
its cost and calculate it.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Yes, of course, such a system of operating accounting for costs is more difficult than usual.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
But there is nothing impossible.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
How does it happen?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And what advantages does it give?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
What advantages?

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Probably, this is already clear.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Now, each process will be evaluated from the point of view of all types of costs that only exist in the company.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Accordingly, you can easily see how much the process costs,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
how much each operation that is included in it costs,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
what type of costs are these costs.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
For example, it is costs for staff, costs for equipment, costs for the office,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
or costs for software,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
or costs for, excuse me, the salary of the manager,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
which you have to control your actions because you can't handle it.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:23.000
It is the operating system of accounting for costs that will allow your company to control the costs of each process.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
How to create it?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
First, you need to describe the business process.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
This is clear.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Then you need to create a system of structure of costs for your company.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Describe all types of costs of the company that you have.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Assign them units and measurements, for example, grams, rubles, dollars, hours, minutes, etc.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
It all depends on the type of resource.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Next, create a structure with centers of costs, assign each center of costs in the monetary expression.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Next, create a process diagram, if you haven't created it yet,

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and calculate the time of each function.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Next, check.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Next, create a corresponding table with analytics.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And then create a diagram of the business process.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Let's take an example of how it happens.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Let's say we have a trading company that sells tea, furniture, and clothes.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It's the same Evrika.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
What types of costs does it have?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
We won't consider all types of costs.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Let's take, for example, costs for staff.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
This is the first one.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Costs for rent.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
This is the second one.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Of course, there are costs for software, for buying materials, etc.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Let's deal with these two types of costs.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Costs for staff and costs for rent.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
How will these costs be measured?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.000
It's clear that costs for staff will be measured in hours.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:24.000
How many hours does a particular employee spend on the execution of a particular process?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Costs for rent.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:33.000
How many square meters is needed to carry out this business process?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Let's take a business process as an example.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Let's say, our favorite one, the purchase of a product.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Let's break it down into sub-processes.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Let's say, the purchase of a product consists of the following sub-processes.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.000
This is the application to the supplier,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
consolidation of all applications into a single application,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.000
then, number three, is the submission of the application to the supplier,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000
number four, is the work with the advertising,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
if the supplier has submitted the application or not,

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
and number five, is the selection of suppliers,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
the work with the suppliers, in other words, monitoring of the supplier's market.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Let's take a consolidation of applications as an example.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
We'll consider its cost.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Similarly, we'll evaluate the cost of all other sub-processes,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
then, we'll add up all the costs of sub-processes

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
to get the cost of the whole business process of the purchase.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Then, we'll calculate the cost of business processes of sales and production.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Then, we'll add all this up and get the cost of the business process of trade,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
for example, with a particular product.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
We'll calculate the cost of any business process in our trading company.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Of course, there are different payment systems.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
For example, we can go from the bottom up, as we are doing now.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
We go from operations, from small sub-processes to business processes of the upper level.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
We can go the other way around.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
We can go from the top to the bottom.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
First, we'll determine the cost of business processes of the upper level,

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and then go down.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:39.000
As practice shows, the second method is less clear, less detailed, less accurate.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Because it is very easy to estimate the costs of business processes of the upper level,

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:52.000
until you understand their structure, their composition, all operations that are included in them.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
So, we'll go from the bottom up.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
We'll see how the cost of a particular sub-process of consolidation of applications is evaluated.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Then, we'll see how the cost of a business process of procurement is calculated, and so on.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So, we have determined that we have specific resources,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:18.000
while we have limited ourselves only to the costs of personnel and rent.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:27.000
We have determined that we will now calculate the specific cost of a specific sub-process of consolidation of applications.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:34.000
If we refer to the specific scheme of calculation of costs for the execution of a process,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
or rather a sub-process of consolidation of applications,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
then, accordingly, we can imagine the following structure.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
For simplicity, let's take just a couple of operations that are included in it.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
This is the submission of applications to departments, this is the processing of applications, and then consolidation.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
How does the mechanism of calculating the cost of this sub-process work?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.000
We remember that we agreed to consider only the costs of personnel and rent.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
So, let's look at the costs of personnel.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Here, the department spends about three hours in total to prepare applications for the procurement of materials.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Their hour costs about 180 rubles.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
The same applies to the processing of applications.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
This is one hour for the manager to process the applications.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Based on the cost of the procurement, we consider that 180 rubles is equivalent to one hour of work.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
The same applies to consolidation.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Now, let's look at the cost of rental.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Let's say that our managers who form applications for the procurement of materials

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
are located in a room about 10 square meters.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
We know that they spend about three hours to do all this.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
We know how much a year's rent costs.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Accordingly, we can calculate how much it costs per hour.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And, accordingly, we can know that every manager sitting in a 10 square meter office spends three hours.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
We know how much a rent costs per hour.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
We can calculate the costs for the place, for the room.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
We add this and this and get the sum for this operation.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
The same thing happens here, the same thing happens here.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
As a result, our consolidation costs 6,000 rubles.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000
This is already something, because now we can know that this operation is not just some kind of amorphous,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
but consists of quite certain costs.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And we can track why the cost of this operation has increased, for example, by the end of the year,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:43.000
if someone suddenly began to perform their functions longer, or someone moved to a larger office.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:50.000
In any case, everything here is tied to the time that employees spend on the business process.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:57.000
This means that the main criterion for the cost of the business process is the time that is spent on its implementation.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
When we know how much such a process costs,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
we can easily calculate the cost of other processes in the same way,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
add up the cost of the business process and purchase,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
the cost of production, the cost of sales, and we can calculate the cost of the business process,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
trade, some products.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Then calculate the business process, financial accounting, strategic management,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000
all the processes of the company at the top level.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
We add up everything and get the sum of costs per company.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Then the manager can easily drill the processes to the lowest level.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000
For example, we have a business process of the highest level of purchase.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Suddenly, at the end of the year, its cost has increased sharply, for example, by 20%.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
What is the reason?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:56.000
The head of the purchase department reveals the cost of the processes in this business process.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
As a result, the consolidation of applications has increased by 30%.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Why?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000
For example, one of the managers began to process applications much slower.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
What is the reason?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000
For example, someone quit, a newbie came and has not yet mastered.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It is clear that such a temporary and emergency reason should not be taken.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
The same applies to absolutely any process.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Only here, in addition to the cost of rent and salary,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
other costs will be added, such as materials, IT, and so on.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Such a process account allows the company to know how much each process, each operation costs

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and what should be paid attention to reduce this cost.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Accordingly, knowing all the costs of the processes,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000
the head of the corporation can easily track the cause of the cost increase

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
up to each small operation.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
It is very convenient and fast.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Now, considering the process approach we have discussed today,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.000
a few words about how the project on building a process management system in the company should be built.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
First, everything starts with the organization of work.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Without a specific plan of events, without a team of participants,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000
determined by the company, it is impossible to create any project,

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000
including a project on building a process management system in the company.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Then, when the structure of the participants is determined,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
the detailed plan of the project,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
it is now possible to distribute the roles, who will be responsible for what,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
and set the approximate deadlines, what deadlines will be fulfilled.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Now, when the organization of work in the project is clear,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
it is possible to start describing the business processes.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
At the first stage, you attract external consultants,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
they must also be taken into account as part of the project participants.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000
And, of course, the organization of work must be approved by them too.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
When we move on to point 2, the description of the business processes in the company,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
we already know how it is done.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
First, the company strategy must be known,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
then the description of the business processes of the upper level,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
then the description of the business processes of the lower level,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000
and then, if necessary, the description of the business processes of the higher level.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Next, the key indicators of the efficiency of the business processes are developed.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
We remember that for this purpose,

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
it is necessary to first analyze the business processes

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
by the criteria of importance, problem-solving, and the possibility of making changes.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
By three criteria.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
First, we must select the most basic ones,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
develop a plan of actions to improve them,

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and then, for all processes, including those that are the number one candidate for optimization,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
develop a KPI.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000
We must remember that we must also develop a map of indicators to use it correctly.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Next, when it is developed, we move on to regulation.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I must say right away that before regulation,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
we must already complete a certain optimization of the most critical business processes.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Otherwise, how can we regulate a process that is still far from optimal?

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
This is an unnecessary waste of time.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
We have already described it.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
We do not need a full-fledged regulation on it.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Therefore, we optimized the most critical main processes.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Next, we wrote process regulations for them and for all the others.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
First, the process regulations, starting with the business processes of the upper level,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
then to the business processes regulations,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
and then to the regulations of various operations, and so on.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Then we move on to the composition of structural regulations,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
from the organizational structure to the position of the unit,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000
and then to the lowest level, that is, to the official instructions of specific people.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
And finally, the very last thing.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
When we have done all this, we must be sure that this is not a one-time project,

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
but a process, a process of business processes management.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.000
In order to constantly optimize and manage business processes,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
you need to do a couple of things.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000
First, you need to develop, describe, regulate the business processes,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
business processes management.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
That is, it is also necessary to create it, regulate it,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
and be sure to assign responsible participants, and so on.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Be sure to have a structure of documentation, a form of accountability.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Then this regulation must be implemented,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
that is, made available to everyone,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
and necessarily to the performers.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And then, it is necessary to train specialists who will be involved in the process management system

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
to constantly maintain a living state.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000
It is necessary to constantly upgrade the description of business processes.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It is necessary to associate with the subdivisions the subject of changing the description of processes,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
changing the regulations, changing the key indicators of efficiency, and so on.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Only with the fifth point, that is, the implementation of the process management system

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and the creation of a business process management system,

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
it will be possible to say that your organization,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000
process management system, has been built and will live for many years.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
The video course on operational management is over.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Today we have introduced you to the process management system,
