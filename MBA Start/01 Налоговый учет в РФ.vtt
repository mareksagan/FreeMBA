WEBVTT

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.120
Good day.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.040
My name is Irina Kiseleva.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.340
Today I will take a video course

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.600
on the organization of optimal taxation.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.120
I have extensive experience

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.200
in audit, tax consulting

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.960
and conducting tax accounting

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.940
seminars.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.680
Using the taxation currently

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.420
existing in Russia, so

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.600
you can organize

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
your company's

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.800
taxation system most

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.760
efficiently and your

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.380
company can pay as much

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.520
tax as it can afford

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.080
at the moment.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.790
Taxes and fees did not always

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.970
exist, and at first they

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.990
were temporary.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.830
From temporary to permanent, they

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.350
have become from the period when

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.310
taxes were used to maintain armies

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.030
that were not dissolved in

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.410
peacetime and the introduction

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.430
of wars.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.590
The permanent nature of the incomes

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.550
of the state budgets of various countries

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.210
they acquired in the early 17th century.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.650
Menjamine Franklin

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830
said that everyone

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.750
should pay taxes

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.710
and die.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.370
As taxes became commonplace for

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.110
the population, the basis for

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.990
the idea of collecting taxes from the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.930
population became

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.530
the non-productive nature

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.330
of public services.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.610
Taxation currently accounts for the

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.490
majority of the budget revenues of different

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.450
countries.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.870
So in Russia they make up 80% of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.750
the budget, in the US 70%, What

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.350
are taxes used and collected today?

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.370
Sometimes they have a purely private

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.250
nature and a private purpose.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.070
In Germany, for example, a tax

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.470
on acetic acid was introduced in the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.770
early century.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.730
For what?

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.390
It was introduced to stop the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.930
use of wine in order to

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.670
produce vinegar acid.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.230
At the same time, the costs of collecting

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.690
this tax were barely covered but

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.070
the goal was achieved and the tax

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.690
was of effective importance

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.410
for the country.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.130
In the same Germany, the sharp increase in the excise

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.270
duty on tobacco has reduced the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.410
number of smokers in the country.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.530
In addition, taxes can be of great

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.390
importance for preserving the environment.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.030
In the 1970s, a tax on motor vehicles was

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.310
introduced in the United States, taking

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.090
into account the environmental frequency of engines.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.850
The tax system is an integral

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.530
part of any society.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.930
In order to maintain the tax

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.110
system, various mechanisms are

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.070
used, in particular, in the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.510
form of tax benefits or the introduction

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.310
of various effective

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.790
tax systems.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.450
In general, they are the same in the states,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.790
they differ only in the order

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.810
of collecting taxes and fees and naturally

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.170
in the types of taxes and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.530
fees themselves.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.730
The purpose of this video course

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.650
is to tell about the types

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.650
of taxes and fees that exist

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.590
in Russia at present.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.690
If anyone is interested in

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.110
the tax system existing and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.430
operating in foreign countries,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.270
then you should contact

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.970
the tax organization in

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.930
the respective states.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.870
The tasks of the organization of acquaintance

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.850
with foreign tax systems this

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.450
course does not put.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.090
You can contact the open sources

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.130
of the International Monetary

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.050
Fund or reports of international

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.610
consulting companies for information

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.130
interested in this area.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.840
We will now look at the types of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.980
taxes and fees that exist in

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.640
Russia at the moment.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.220
The system of taxation and types of

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.500
taxes and fees in Russia is

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.100
established by the Constitution

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.700
of the Russian Federation and the Tax

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.980
Code of Russia.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.620
Federal, regional and local

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.960
taxes are currently established.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.360


00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.620
Federal taxes shall be established the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.060
same for all enterprises, organizations,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.940
individuals, existing, living

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.800
and conducting their activities

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.980
in the territory of the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.460
Russian Federation.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.260
Regional taxes are established

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.960
by the subjects of the Russian Federation,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.760
respectively, and are obligatory

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.800
for application on the territory

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.560
of these subjects.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.700
Local taxes are established by

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.040
local self-government bodies.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.100
There are currently nine

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.120
types of federal taxes.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.680
These are known taxes, such

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.380
as value added tax,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.020
income tax, excise duties,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.900
state duties, fees for the

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.280
use of animal world objects

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.780
and some other taxes.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.120
Regional taxes include the tax

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.080
on the property of legal entities,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.900
the property tax of the local

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.920
tax includes the land

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.720
tax and the property tax

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.000
of natural persons.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.680
All of the above taxes have

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.620
the same economic nature.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.060
As an economic category, any tax reflects

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.960
the relationship between the state,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.140
the population and the legal

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.860
measures received by the population

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.000
or legal entities for the purpose

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.320
of governmental needs.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.160
More specifically, the

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.640
tax can be considered as

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.440
a free, mandatory payment

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.740
required for

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.640
the needs of the state

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.060
budget or for non-budgetary

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.120
state funds, such as

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:49.360
the Pension Fund, the

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.360
Medical Social Fund.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.360
The first and most important function

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.740
of taxation is fiscal.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.880
The essence of this function is

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.280
that taxes should supplement the income

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.260
of the state treasury

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.460
and extra-budgetary state funds.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.080
Regulatory function also has a great

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.660
importance supplementation and

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.760
regulation of certain types of

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.380
activities that are

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.520
carried out in our country.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.280
Thus, individual types of taxes

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.900
by means of tax benefits allow

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.800
to develop activities, for

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.540
example, related to the creation

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.620
of jobs for disabled people.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.540
Other taxes narrow activities,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.380
such as those related to the

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.280
development of natural minerals.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.960
The third function that performs

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.660
all taxes is the control function.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.840
The state, by means of taxes,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.580
controls the

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.760
financial and economic

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.480
activities of enterprises or

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.780
individuals.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.520
In addition to taxes, there are also fees in the

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.140
country.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.020
The fee is a mandatory payment

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.240
that is mandatory when performing

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.800
certain legal actions,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.260
when issuing rights or when

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.340
issuing a license.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.900
In addition to taxes and fees, the concept of

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.260
payments to the budget, such as fines and

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.700
fines, is in place in the country.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.900
Pennies are the amounts you are obliged

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.580
to pay to the budget if you

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.060
miss the period of payment of

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.580
taxes and fees established by law.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.060
The taxation practice, which is

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.920
applied in different countries,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.060
has developed certain uniform

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.580
principles for all taxation systems.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.900
One of the main principles

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.260
is the proportionality of expenses

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.940
in the form of taxes and income.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.680
It is also called the

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.880
principle of justice,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.960
when citizens and with

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.480
higher incomes

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.880
pay higher taxes.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.200
For example, in Russia last

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.420
year was submitted

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:26.240
to the State B list of luxury

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.360
items subject to this

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.600
tax, including apartments

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.720
worth more than 15

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.720
million rubles, cars, aircraft,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.680
boats worth more than

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.220
2 million rubles and

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.740
jewelry, as well as

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.720
art objects worth more

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.440
than 300 thousand

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.360
rubles.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.360
The next principle of the organization

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.040
of the tax system is the principle

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.960
of conformity of the payment of

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.720
tax to the income received.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.040
This means that the tax cannot be

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.940
paid on previously received income.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.840
Another principle of the organization

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.580
of the taxation system is the clarity

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.520
of the formulations and principles

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.360
of the amount of the time period

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.060
for establishing the tax, which

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.140
must be set out in certain

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.100
formulations in the legislation,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.340
which can be accessible to all citizens.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.580
With all the uniformity of taxes for

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.060
all enterprises and organizations

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.560
operating in the territory of a country,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.160
the result in the form of taxes

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.380
can be in two similar in

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.340
essence of the organization activities

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.440
completely different.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.900
This is due either to the choice of

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.860
the tax system or to the quality of

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.000
the training of accountants.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.040
If in the first case with the choice

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.640
of the system of taxation the result

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.800
affects the amount of tax, then in

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.640
the second case with insufficient

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.760
qualification of accounting workers,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.980
the result can affect the

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.180
payment of fines and penalties.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.740
Consider more in detail the

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.560
structure of taxes in the income

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.040
of certain budgets.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.220
For comparison, we take the two leading countries,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.220
Russia and the United States.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.120
As can be seen from the table on the

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.360
slide, in our country the main

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.260
part of the income of the state

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.040
budget is the income tax.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.700
In the United States, the majority

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.840
of income is tax on individuals'

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.120
income.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.580
Thus, it can be asserted that

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.720
the main burden in the form of tax

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.140
exemption in the income of our budget

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.860
lies on enterprises, on

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.020
legal entities, and in the United

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.280
States on individuals.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.260
If we compare the other

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.840
two tax revenues, they will

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.660
coincide in this case.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.780
This is social insurance deductions.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.160
In our country they are 19%, and in the United

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.580
States 34%.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.980
But there is also a significant

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.500
difference, since we have social

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.060
insurance contributions made

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.000
by the donors who make payments

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.320
to individuals, and in the United

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.780
States these contributions

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.920
are equally paid to the

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.780
donors and employees.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.340
In conclusion of the topic on consideration

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.000
of the types of taxes and

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.320
fees existing in our country,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.280
I would like to note that in

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.540
addition to the above-mentioned

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.760
federal, regional and local taxes,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.940
the country has established so-

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.960
called special tax regimes,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.740
which provide for the payment

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.980
of their taxes and at the

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.440
same time abolish certain

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.920
federal, local or regional taxes.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.860
This special tax regime

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.040
includes the following system

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.040
of taxation in the form of

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.700
a single agricultural tax,

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.720
which provides for the payment

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.100
of a single

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.700
agricultural tax by organizations,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.940
enterprises producing

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.980
agricultural products.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.700
The following system is a simplified

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.680
taxation system, which provides

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.440
for the payment of a single

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.900
tax or income tax minus expenses.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.460
The system of single tax,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.340
fixed income, provides for the payment

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.380
of a single tax on basic income

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.160
on certain types of activities.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.060
The system of taxation of agreements

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.520
on the division of products.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.270
In order to conduct a business effectively

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.510
in a country, you need to know

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.750
your rights and duties.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.010
Consider the rights and obligations

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.650
of taxpayers, i.e. enterprises

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.450
and organizations, and individual

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.230
entrepreneurs, who are recognized

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.150
in accordance with the first

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.570
part of the tax code

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.670
as payers of certain taxes

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.930
and fees.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.030
Taxpayers have the following rights.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.390
First, we have the right to receive any

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.650
free information regarding the types

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.390
of taxes and fees existing in our country,

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.650
the procedure for their payment,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.270
the procedure for their calculation.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.190
We have the right to receive

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.210
forms of tax declarations that

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.310
are currently in force on certain

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.830
taxes.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.650
To do this, you need to come to the

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:07.710
tax authority where you are attached

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.670
and where you have been issued

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.170
the so-called taxpayer identification number.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.450
To issue this INN, it is necessary

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.090
to register with the

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.650
tax authorities before starting

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.650
economic activity.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.490
In addition, you have the right

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.290
to receive written explanations from

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.170
tax authorities, which are presented

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.470
by the Ministry of Finance of

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.090
the Russian Federation, you have

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.590
the right to participate

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.130
in the examination of

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.510
the results of the tax inspection,

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.250
you have the right to complain

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.110
to the higher tax

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.710
authority.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.770
Besides rights, there are also duties.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.730
The main duty is to calculate the

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.350
payment of taxes and fees within the

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.510
time limits established by the legislation.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.110
From the numerical tax and fees we

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.350
are obliged to present in writing to

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.670
the tax authorities.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.370
For example, the VAT tax declaration

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.050
must be submitted no later than

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.250
the 20th of the month following

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.170
the reporting quarter.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.630
The tax return must be submitted

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.950
no later than the 28th of

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.310
the following quarter of

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.790
the reporting period.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.390
Tax authorities also have a

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.250
wide range of rights and duties.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.790
What relates to them?

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.030
First, tax authorities are

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.950
required to provide us with

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.010
free information about the

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.270
types of taxes and fees

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.810
that exist at the moment.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.150
You must consult, and for free.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.510
For this purpose, a special program

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.470
for expanding tax points on tax

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.730
consulting has been developed.

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.470
Unfortunately, this program

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.630
suffered a bit of a fiasco.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.850
It was developed in 2001, but

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.870
is now more advised

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.710
by commercial firms, tax

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.910
authorities.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.810
The duties of tax authorities

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.790
also include mandatory

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.390
guidance in their actions, whether

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.150
in tax checks or in consultations.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.930
The documents are guided by letters

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.650
and explanations made by the

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.930
Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.010
The tax authorities are

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.410
guided by decisions of the courts

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.450
of arbitration, which were

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.370
made not in favor of the tax

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.490
authorities.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.390
This is done in order to

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.290
reduce the time to resolve disputed

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.810
issues that will surely

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:13.850
benefit the taxpayer.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.730
Tax authorities have the

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.030
right to take actions such

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.230
as demanding documents

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.590
from the taxpayer for checks,

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.810
and the list of documents

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.010
necessary for checks

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.070
is submitted in writing.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.230
The right of tax authorities is to

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.250
check any enterprise that is directly

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.930
related to the calculation

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.110
or to conduct counter-checks,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.790
for example, on the results of

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.170
the verification of your counterparty.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.510
Also, the tax authorities are granted

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.570
broad rights in terms of

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.230
receiving advice from third-party

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.910
experts, specialists who have

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.850
certain issues on technology,

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.310
production, rendering of

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.070
services or performing works

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.750
more and better than the tax

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.630
authorities themselves.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.770
In order to perform their functions,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.570
tax authorities have developed

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.150
a single standard for the

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.410
service of taxpayers, which can

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.410
be read, and can be

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.870
read in open access in the information

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.290
systems existing

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.430
in our country.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.910
To inform about the rights and

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.510
obligations of your own tax agents

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.610
or taxpayers in our country,

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.410
the state tax service has developed

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.330
and actively expands its format

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.590
website www.tax.ru There you can

00:19:54.590 --> 00:20:01.230
get any information about your

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.390
enterprise and, most importantly,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.110
about other enterprises with

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.810
which you are going to work, in

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.650
particular, about the location

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.870
of the legal entity, its founders,

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.070
about its correct identification

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.490
numbers and some other

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.230
information that is very

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.730
important, especially

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.350
with large and important

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.370
transactions for your

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.770
enterprise.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.210
In addition, tax authorities conduct

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.530
seminars, which highlight questions

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.790
about the rules of calculation

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.150
of taxes and fees, about the rules of

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.070
drawing up tax declarations, about

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.090
the work of the tax authorities

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.170
themselves during the filing

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.490
of tax reports.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:59.930
Not so long ago specifically for a resource

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.450
called “Check if you and your

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.050
business are not risking.”

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:13.510
On the website tax.ru is a list

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.770
of addresses with mass registration

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.390
of legal entities, as well as

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.890
a list of those heads of enterprises

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.650
that were disqualified

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:24.710
as a leader.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.890
This can undoubtedly help

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.850
that have to work

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.790
with, especially in big

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.630
cities.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.970
In addition, you can consult the

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.610
tax authorities naturally

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.390
and personally, not only virtually.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.970
To do this, you can come

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.910
and register for the reception

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.210
at the tax authority,

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.310
where your 592 applications

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.650
from different enterprises and

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.770
individuals for clarifications

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.170
on certain issues have been

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.050
registered.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.430
They are mainly addressed on issues

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.090
of correctness of taxation or the

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.050
choice of taxation system.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.910
In our country there are

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.230
tax amnesty.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.250
Last year from 31 December

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.070
2007.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.190
What is it?

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.530
The tax amnesty provides for the amnesty

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.390
of the amounts of income

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.410
that were received by individuals

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.290
before 2006.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.550
I would like to point out

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.330
that tax amnesty, wherever

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.530
it is, is for individuals

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.930
and not for legal entities.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.590
If a legal entity has violated

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.530
the rules for calculating certain

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.230
taxes and fees, certain

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.110
measures are provided

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.710
for for this, but not tax amnesty.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.270
The last tax amnesty was successfully

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.010
held last year, the nearest has

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.070
not yet been identified.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.730
In order to conduct such effective

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.830
tax naturally, our tax service

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.930
requests advice from other

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.470
tax authorities of

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.590
foreign countries.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.130
For example, the experience of

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.430
such amnesty in Kazakhstan

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.650
was used for tax amnesty,

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.570
where the majority of amnesty

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.450
amounts were received in

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.210
the last days of amnesty.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.890
In order to amnestiate their

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.730
income, which for any reason was

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.090
not taxed at the time, it

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.730
was not necessary to submit to

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.490
the tax authorities documents

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.850
about the sources of income.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.930
They had to pay 13% of the

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.890
amount received.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.270
This would be considered as a tax

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.650
payment without any consequences.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.490
International cooperation in the field

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.550
of taxation is actively developing.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.190
The two countries have signed agreements

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.490
on avoidance of double taxation with

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.170
countries in Europe, America, Asia and

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.390
Australia.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.590
The agreement on the exchange

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:42.090
of information on indirect

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:46.970
taxes is relevant

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.850
at this time.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.530
At present, such agreements

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.690
only apply to direct taxes.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.230
The conclusion of agreements and exchange

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.330
of information between countries

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.390
such as the Arab Emirates, Emanak

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.590
and Seychelles, which are countries

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.290
where there is preferential taxation,

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:11.290
which for certain reasons

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.270
is sought by many businessmen

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.670
and entrepreneurs, is also

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.290
of particular importance.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.950
Therefore, it is important to

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.730
have general information about both the

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.350
founders and the payment on our territory

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.390
in Russia there are also special

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.270
economic zones where

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.850
preferential taxation is provided.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.770
These include Kaliningrad,

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.250
Magadan region, and

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.130
Elabuga in Tatarstan.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.050
There are registered and operate in

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.330
a special preferential tax regime legal

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.530
entities and entrepreneurs,

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.430
which carries out activities

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.070
there in order to develop the

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.490
socio-economic

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.330
zone, the development of

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:13.510
enterprises in these areas.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.910
Therefore, many entrepreneurs,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.110
of course, Russian, are seeking

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.210
to register and create

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.850
in these territories

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.270
to pay as little tax as

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.250
possible.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.970
Such zones, offshore,

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.090
foreign or our special economic

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.670
zones, naturally, are subject

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.170
to special attention from

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.590
the tax authorities.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.510
In other countries, tax

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.790
authorities treat offshore

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:52.050
zones and zones with special

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.870
taxation with caution.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.550
For example, in Italy, if a company

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.290
has registered a subsidiary in the

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.250
territory of an offshore zone,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.630
the tax is required in the same

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.290
system as the main company

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.070
pays under Italian laws.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.710
If it is not possible to determine

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.810
the amount of taxes of a

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.110
subsidiary in an offshore zone,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.090
the Italian company paying

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.750
the taxes and fees for its

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.230
subsidiary in full according

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.350
to Italian law.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.410
Let us consider the procedure for

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.550
calculating taxes and fees,

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.450
which is in effect in Russia in more detail.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.890
With all the diversity of taxes

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.550
and fees, there is a certain

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.110
general rule that applies

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.590
to all types of taxes and fees.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.010
These are some elements that are

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:01.090
mandatory for the beginning

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:02.470
of certain taxes.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.930
For example, a tax object,

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.030
which is established

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.930
literally for all taxes, the only

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.370
difference can be the nature

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.270
of the object itself.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.210
For example, it can be the volume

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.710
of sales of goods, works, services,

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.490
income, property or other circumstance,

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.130
when the occurrence of which

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:32.150
is considered to be a tax.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.270
Tax bases are a timestone physical

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.390
or other characteristic of the

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.050
object of taxation.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.110
The tax bases for different

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.250
taxes can be very different.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.210
In this case, some special conditions for

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.870
implementation of a particular implementation

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.350
are taken into account.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.350
For example, the tax base

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.290
for the sale of services to so-

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.530
called interdependent persons

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.350
is calculated in a special way.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.690
A small example.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:13.670
If you have sold your products

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.110
to a mutually dependent entity,

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.830
i.e. a legal entity that

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.870
participates in your capital

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.890
within 20%, or a person who

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:34.670
is with you in a specified position

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.890
or relative, no matter

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.670
brother, sister, wife or

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.590
husband, then the tax

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.290
base can be converted

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.650
at market prices.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.210
These rules of special calculation

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.890
of the tax base can be considered, with

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.130
them you can get acquainted in Article

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.230
40 of Part 1 of the Tax Code.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.470
The next characteristic of taxes and

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.070
fees, the same for all taxes,

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:06.290
is the procedure for payment of

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:07.930
taxes and fees.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.270
The payment procedure may be different

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:17.610
as the reporting period occurs,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.030
for example, a quarter or a month,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:25.870
after the expiry of the tax

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.870
rate on different taxes can be established

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.390
in both a solid amount

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.990
and a percentage of the

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.310
tax base.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:38.070
For example, for the NTS,

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.570
for the value added tax,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.810
the tax rate is set

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.810
in percentage.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.390
It can be different and in size.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.430
For example, when

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.150
selling export products

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.110
the rate is 0%, when selling

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.030
food or medical goods

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.350
the tax rate is

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.770
10%, when selling

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.390
other goods the

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:05.410
maximum is 18%.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.550
The tax rate can be in

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.910
rubles or in percentage.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.990
The income tax rate is

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.110
also in percentage.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.170
The tax procedure and time limits

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.170
may also be different.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:26.790
For example, the value added tax

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:32.390
must be paid no later than the

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.170

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.350
which was listed when considering

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.930
the payment of value added tax.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.570
The single tax in the simplified

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.870

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.890
tax benefits for payment

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.350
of certain taxes and fees.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.510
They are provided in different variants.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.630
For example, a certain minimum

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.830
of the accrued tax may not be

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.850
taxable, for example, the minimum

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.750
wage is not taxed.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.110
Tax benefits may be granted

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.970
to non-taxable property transferred

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.330
by the founder of the organization

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.310
in favour of this organization

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.930
during the year, if

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.670
this property was not

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.770
sold to other persons.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.910
Tax benefits are established by

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.190
some category of taxpayers,

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.150
for example, disabled persons.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.130
The taxes and fees are calculated

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:14.850
independently and submitted

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.910
to the tax inspectorate

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.050
in the form of a tax declaration.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.090
The tax declaration may be submitted

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.350
by the tax inspector personally by the

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.850

or transmitted on the Internet.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.490
In any case, this is not specified

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.550
and at any time the order of

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.550
submission of the tax declaration

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.030
may be different.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.910
In addition to taxes, there is a

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.450
duty of taxpayers to calculate

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.410
and pay advance payments

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.110
on certain taxes and fees within

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:55.770
the established time limits.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.850
Advance payments are

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.270
equal to the same equivalent

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.190
taxes and fees.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.170
Advance payments are provided for the

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.250

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.470
Profit tax, land tax, transport

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.530
tax, property tax.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.410
The obligation is considered fulfilled

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:25.050
when the payment order with the amount

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.070
of tax is transferred to the bank in the

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.810
presence of the corresponding balance

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.250
of funds in the enterprise.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.150
In addition, the duty to pay taxes

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.490
is considered to be fully fulfilled

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:39.770
when the company is liquidated.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.410
Of course, all the budget

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:43.370
calculations must be completed.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.050
Now we will consider in more

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.550
detail the procedure for calculating

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.510
some of the taxes and fees

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.690
most common in the Russian

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:56.550
Federation.

00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:01.390
Let us start with the value added tax.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.310
Value added tax is a tax calculated

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.730
from the value of the

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.910
products produced, performed

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.450
works or rendered services.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.710


00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:19.070
It was introduced in Russia in 1992

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.410
and is currently regulated by 21

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.730
chapters of the Tax Code.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.190
Taxpayers of this tax are all enterprises,

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.590

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:33.090
Federation, as well as foreign

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.210
organizations of enterprises that

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.130
carry out activities in the territory

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.670
of the Russian Federation

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.670
or import goods into

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.730
the customs territory of

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.410
the Russian Federation.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.750
Any enterprises may be exempt

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.730
from payment of this tax

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.310
when fulfilling certain

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.450
conditions provided

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.770

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.710

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:07.550
The exemption can be obtained no later

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.370

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:14.790
tax authorities.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.010
At the same time, it should be borne in

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.290
mind that an enterprise which

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.390
has received an exemption, which is in

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.610

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.310
by the enterprise, services rendered

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.270
or works performed.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:41.750
The VAT amount in the invoice is indicated

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.910
at zero rate, that is, it is

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.350
not available at all.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:50.790
Enterprises must submit tax declarations

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.870
with scripts within the same

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.370
time limits as those established

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:59.110
for ordinary enterprises

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.790
who are VAT payers.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:04.950
The subject of taxation on

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:08.050
value added tax are the following

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:14.650
types of implementation.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:18.210
These are goods, works, services

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.190
that have been produced at your

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.130
enterprise or goods that have

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.210
been purchased for resale.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.090
For example, you bought a product for 100

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.130
rubles, sold it for 120, the object of

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.690
taxation will be the difference.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.190
The tax will be charged to the total

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.850
amount of goods sold, i.e.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.090
120 rubles.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.030
In the case of the transfer of

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.990
property, work, services, the subject

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.970

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:53.190
market price of these works, services

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.370
or property.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.010
A small example, for example,

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.930
you move from one to another and

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:05.930
left the furniture to the tenant

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.950
or future tenant of that room.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.330
The residual value

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.030
of this property will be

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.590
the object of taxation

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.910
on value added.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.490
Construction works for

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.050
own consumption

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.570
are also subject

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.570
to taxation.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.570
For example, an organization performing

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.790
construction, installation, repair

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.470
work in the country has built

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.050
a pool for its own consumption,

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.590
that is, for use by

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.410
employees of the enterprise.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.250
The cost of the pool will

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.910
also be subject to taxation.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:52.790
If you have imported goods into the territory

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.430
of the Russian Federation

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.790
from abroad, the value of goods determined

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.390
by the Customs Code of the Russian

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:02.810
Federation will also be subject

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.470
to taxation.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.210
The time limit for payment of value

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.690
added tax is the 20th of the month

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.830
following the reporting quarter.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:21.270
Reporting period since 2008 for taxation.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:27.070
The main rates are 0.10 and 18%.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:30.070
The tax base is calculated as the difference

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.330
between the amount of goods

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.930
sold and the amount of services and

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.710
tax deductions or the year established

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.330
by Chapter 21 of the Tax Code.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.010
The slide is an example of calculation of the

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.490
amount of the tax on the added Example of

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.190

The company purchased materials for the

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.810
amount of 59 thousand rubles, including

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.390

submitted to you from the supplier was 9

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:02.010
thousand rubles.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.470
In the same period, our company

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.130
provided VAT-taxable services at

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.010

in the invoice you issue, will

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.010
be 21600 rubles.

The amount of tax you have to

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.950
pay to the budget is calculated simply.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.410
We must deduct from the VAT amount

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.930
charged in accordance with the

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:37.490

21 600 rubles.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.470
The amount of VAT that the supplier

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.390
has presented to us when

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.250
purchasing materials sold or

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.170
used in the management activity.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.090

that is, for the first quarter of

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.010
2008, will be 12 600 rubles.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.070
Let us go to the common

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.290
social tax.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.990
The unified social tax is

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.050
intended for the mobilization of

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.050

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.230
Who is the taxpayer of the

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.990

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.090
These include all enterprises,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.750
eridic persons, individual

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.250
entrepreneurs, as well as lawyers

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:47.090
who are not employers,

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:53.030
who pay out collective

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:58.030
labour contracts to individuals.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.190


00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.590
In the calculation of the single

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:09.190
social tax progressive tax rates.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:14.090
The higher the taxpayer's income,

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.530
the lower the rate of the

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.350
single social tax.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.910
The maximum rate of the single

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.270
social tax for today is 12% of

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:25.970
the amounts of payments, and to the

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:29.210
pension fund 14%.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.690
The subject of taxation of the

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:35.010
single social tax is the payments

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.050
of the employer in favor of

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:38.950
employees, calculated firstly on

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:40.630
labor contracts in accordance

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.650
with the Labor Code, and secondly

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:46.370
on civil law contracts.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.410
When paying the single social tax,

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.890
a system of calculation and payment

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.730
of advance payments is provided.

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.310
Advance payments of the single

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.710
social tax are calculated monthly

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:04.730
until the 15th of the month following

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.630
the reporting period.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:13.210
As a result, future advance

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.230
payments take into account

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.510
the amount of advance payments

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.230
paid before.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:21.930
Consider a small example of calculation

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:26.590
of the ESS and the amount of deductions

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:27.930
to the Pension Fund of the Russian

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:31.990
Federation on payments made by the employer

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.430
in favor of the employee of the firm

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.150
in accordance with the employment contract.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.250
In January 2008, the employee

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.070
was charged 50 thousand

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.370
rubles.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.410
The employer must calculate the amount

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.930
of the single social tax and the amount

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.510
of deductions to the Pension Fund of the

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.270
Russian Federation accordingly,

00:43:55.270 --> 00:44:00.310
at rates of 12% SN and 14% pension fund.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.590
As a result, the employer's expenses

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.770
for January 2008 on the

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.970
charges made to this employee

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:10.450
will be 13 thousand rubles.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.090
There are also tax benefits

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.310
for this tax, which can be read

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:21.730
in detail in Chapter 24 of

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:22.770
the Tax Code.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.630
For example, benefits are

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:28.730
provided for payments to disabled

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:33.310
persons of groups 1, 2 and 3 within

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.590
100 thousand rubles for the reporting

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.950
period.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.930
Now to the next tax.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.430
Tax on Profit.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.950
The income tax, also called

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:43.390
income tax, was introduced

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:47.270
in our country for a long time,

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:53.830
but the tax tax was introduced

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.270
only in 2002.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.530
An entity can receive both

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.270
profit and loss during a reporting

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.230
or tax period, but income

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.630
tax is naturally paid only

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.170
on the received profit.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:11.770
Who is the taxpayer of

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:13.190
this tax?

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.890
Taxpayers of income tax carrying

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.930
out their activities in the

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.050
territory of the Russian Federation

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.610
through a permanent representative

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.410
office or receiving income

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:35.430
from a Russian organization.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.230
The income tax is calculated at a

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.630
rate of 24% from the general tax base.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.490
Also, for certain types of income,

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.090
rates are provided in a smaller amount.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:50.970
For example, a 9% tax rate is provided

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.470
in the form of dividends received

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.710
by a Russian organization.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:00.890
The rate of 15% is provided for

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.090
taxes in the form of dividends

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.610
received by a foreign organization

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.730
from a Russian organization.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:09.000


00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:09.750


00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:13.790
The income tax is calculated as the monetary

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.050
expression of the profit received

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:21.810
between the difference in income

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.570
and expenses made in the reporting

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.770
period.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.810
If the company has received

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.510
a loss during the reporting period,

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:33.910
the tax base is recognized as zero.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.650
A small example.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.090
In the first quarter of 2008,

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:40.830
the company received a profit

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.430
of 300 thousand rubles.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.070
In the first quarter, the company

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.230
will have to pay a profit tax at the

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:51.350
rate of 24%, which will be 72 thousand rubles.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:53.510
In the second quarter, the organization

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.270
worked not very well and received

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:57.110
a loss of 500 thousand

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.170
rubles.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.170
Thus, the growing outcome of this

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.150
semestre organization received a

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:07.350
loss of 200 thousand rubles, and

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:09.670
the tax base for the semestre

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:14.030
is recognised at zero rubles.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.230
However, despite this, the company, according

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.850
to the results of the first quarter, still

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.630
has to calculate and transfer the budget

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:25.890
of the income tax in the amount of 72

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.530
thousand rubles.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.910
To calculate the correct income tax,

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:34.910
an entity must choose and approve

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.650
in its accounting policy the

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.930
method of calculation, the method

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.190
of recognising income and expenses.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.110
There are two types of methods

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:49.010
of recognition of income and expenses.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.670
This is the method of calculation and the cash method.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:56.030
In short, the method of charging

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.770
does not depend on the moment of receipt

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.990
of funds to your billing account

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.890
or the company's cash.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.610
The cash method is directly related

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.050
to the actual availability

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.610
of funds, their actual receipt

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.810
from your buyers and the actual

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:18.550
payment of the costs that your

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.010
company has incurred.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.910
Let us look at a small example of calculating

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.850
the tax base on the profit

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.710
of an enterprise using method counting.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.170
The company purchased 100 units of goods

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.850
for the amount of 50 thousand rubles.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.070
That is, the price of

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.090
the purchase of one unit of goods

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.430
is 500 rubles per stitch.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.750
In the same period, it sold half

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.790
of the purchased goods.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.090
The cost of labor was 10

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:49.830
thousand rubles.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.330
The amount of the social

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:56.370
tax and the social fund was

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.110
2600 rubles.

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:00.870
The tax base for income

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.590
tax will be 50,000 rubles

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.850
minus expenses

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:12.390
of 37600 rubles.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:18.790
The tax rate of 24% applies to the difference

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:23.410
between income and expenses.

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:27.150
This tax must be paid no later than

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:31.670
the 28th of the month following

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.890
the reporting period.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:36.090
The reporting period for income

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.190
tax is a quarter, half-year,

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.950
nine months and a year.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:45.190
Thus, if our company purchased

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:48.550
and sold goods in the first

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.650
quarter of 2008, the amount

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:53.330
of income tax calculated

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.150
in our example, it must

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:56.770
pay no later than April

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.930
28, 2008.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.830
In other countries, there

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.330
are other income tax

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.850
rates.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.470
In Bulgaria, the income tax

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:12.110
rate is 15%, in Australia

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:18.150
30%, in Austria 26%, in

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:21.770
Canada 36%.

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:24.310
As you can see, the rate of

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:25.770
income tax applied in our

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:29.470
country is quite average.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.370
If you compare the situation

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:37.110
in relation to this tax

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.510
compared to other countries,

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.850
we are not in the most

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:44.890
advantageous position, as

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:46.970
in many European countries,

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.750
in Germany, tax benefits

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.910
are provided for legal entities

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.730
and entrepreneurs in the

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.210
first three years of

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.310
business development.

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:02.230
When there is no cash,

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:04.350
there is no customer.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:09.930
Therefore, in the first three

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.210
years, German companies may not

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.970
pay income tax, but after the

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.470
expiry of these first three

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:21.610
years of business development,

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.410
in the presence of losses,

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:38.430
enterprises, taxpayers of this

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:41.150
tax are obliged to reimburse

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.150
the tax.

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:46.350
In Ukraine, income tax

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.050
is calculated by a different

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:48.990
method.

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:54.230
It is paid at 25% of the amount

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:56.050
of income received for the

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.350
previous tax period.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:01.970
In 2008 the Ukrainian enterprise

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:04.950
paid 25% of the income

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:08.750
received in 2007 equally

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.870
each quarter.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.070
If the enterprise was not conducted

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.090
in the previous year, for example,

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.610
in 2007, then the tax inspectorate

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:19.970
independently calculates

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:24.410
this tax, based on expected

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:29.510
income and expenses.

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:33.110
In Italy, when registering

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.850
an enterprise, it receives

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:38.410
a preliminary calculation of expected

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:42.010
taxes, from which it begins, actually

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:44.110
speaking, the activity, business and

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.750
interaction on the payment of taxes

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:51.670
of the Italian enterprise with the

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:54.050
tax authorities of this country.

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.180
In order to successfully conduct your business

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.440
in Russia, in addition to the types

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.000
of taxes and fees, you need to

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.320
know well and understand the tax systems.

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.340
There are three main tax

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.040
systems in Russia.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.800
This is a general ordinary or generally

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.280
accepted taxation system in

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.580
a reduced version, it is

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.060
called the USN.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.540
Simplified system of taxation and

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.360
the system of taxation of

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.560
the single tax on the income.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.600
The abbreviated name of this system is

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.140
ENVD.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.580
The general system of taxation

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.100
is provided for all types of

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.380
enterprises, large, medium or small,

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:45.240
who have expressed the desire

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.980
to apply this system.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.700
But for large taxpayers, this

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.880
is the only option

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.900
of applying the tax system.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.040
It is used by gas companies, oil

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.700
companies, insurers, bankers, builders.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.800
The simplified tax system

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:09.540
is for small business entities.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:13.180
It is widely used

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:19.300
by consulting and legal firms.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.860
The ENOVD system does not provide restrictions,

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:29.100
except for the types of activities.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.240
In other words, under the single tax

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.360
on the imposed income fall not

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.220
enterprises, but activities that are

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.320
introduced under the special regime

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.000
of taxation in certain subjects

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.500
of the Russian Federation.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.160
Let us look at each system in more detail.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.900
The general tax system

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:55.860
is for a wide range of taxpayers.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.100
It provides for the payment of

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.580
all federal, local and

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.560
regional taxes, the main of which

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.480
are value added tax, income

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.900
tax, property tax and a single

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.540
social tax with the number

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.820
of the Pension Fund of the

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.340
Russian Federation.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.280
No application of the test system

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.340
is required to submit any claims

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.400
to the tax authorities.

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.420
By default, an entity is

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.460
considered to be the payer

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:32.080
of all the basic taxes during

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.560
the period of activity.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.820
The objects of taxation are selected

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.120
according to the options

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.060
provided for different types of

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.020
taxes in accordance with the tax code.

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.340
We will look at the example of the

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.820
calculation of taxes that

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.440
are subject to payment to taxpayers

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.420
on the usual tax system.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.820
The company received revenues

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.400
of 236 thousand rubles,

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.140
including VAT of 36 thousand

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.940
rubles, calculated

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.420
at the VAT rate of

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.660
18%.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.340
The net income will be

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.220
200 thousand rubles.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.820
The costs incurred by the company

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.700
during this period amounted

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.240
to 180 thousand rubles, including

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.660
the single social tax of

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.920
24 thousand rubles.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.840
Also the amount of VAT we received

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.440
in the invoices presented to

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:44.080
us for various services and works

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.840
performed for our company in the

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.960
amount of 32 thousand rubles.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.960
Thus, the amount of all tax payments

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.120
that the company will be obliged to

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.760
pay for the first quarter of 2008 consists

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.620
of the income tax calculated as the

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.580
difference between income and expenses

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.900
of 20 thousand rubles, multiplied

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.940
by the rate of 24%, which

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:14.220
will be 4800 rubles, the amount

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:18.080
of VAT, which will be calculated

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.200
as the difference between the

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.020
amount charged from our sale of 36

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.220
thousand rubles, and the amount

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:30.320
received for compensation due

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.020
to the reimbursement for

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:35.460
the services provided to us.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.000
The amount of VAT will be 4 thousand rubles

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.560
and the amount of the single social

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.000
tax, which is charged on payments

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.420
to our employees.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.640
As a result, the amount of taxes,

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.120
calculated as the amount of VAT

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:54.720
and CN income tax, will be 32 800 rubles.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.680
For all the above taxes, our company

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.020
will have to submit

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.940
to the tax authorities tax

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.320
declarations on income tax separately,

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.840
on VAT and on the single

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.440
social tax.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.080
If the firm has property on the

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.340
balance sheet or land, in addition

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.660
to these taxes, it will be

00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.640
required to transfer the land tax and

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.240
property tax taxes.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.880
If our company had no revenue

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.340
from sales and had no income

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.860
during the first quarter,

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:41.480
then from the past for such

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.100
start-up businessmen, for such

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.540
start-up firms, a simplified

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.280
form of tax return was provided.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.080
In other words, our company

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.000
would not submit three VAT and

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.340
CIS tax declarations, but only

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.460
one simplified declaration.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.260
The next option of the organization

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.440
of the taxation system,

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.820
common in Russia is

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.760
the simplified taxation system.

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:16.160
Under this system, tax

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.100
organisations pay a single

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:22.320
tax on either the revenue

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.200
or all received total income,

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.760
and are exempt

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.240
from numerous taxes, such

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.920
as VAT, ESS, property tax

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.140
and profit tax.

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:42.720
How can the tax be calculated

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.740
using this system?

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:49.600
There are two ways to calculate taxes.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.620
The object of taxation is

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.740
total income.

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.580
The second option of calculating

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.960
the tax object tax income minus

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.720
expenses.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.840
The tax rate on income

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.820
tax is only

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.480
6%.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.440
In the second option, the

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.200
tax rate is 15%.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.340
We will look at an example of the

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.200
calculation of taxes of an enterprise

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.180
on a simplified taxation

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.060
system, which applies the

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.720
method of taxing income.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.960
The simplified tax system is

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.320
applied exclusively

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.020
by small business entities.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.260
The rules of taxation on this system

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:43.280
are established in Chapter 26.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.700
2 of the Tax Code.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.700
To apply the simplified

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.880
taxation system, companies must

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.520
file a application with the tax

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.540
authorities at the place of their

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.940

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:02.820
to 30 November of the year

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.480
in which you want to apply

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.740
the simplified taxation system.

In the statement, you must indicate your

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.500
income for the last 9 months of

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.760
the current year, as well as the

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.800
method of taxation for the two

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.160
options presented in this chapter.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.360
Income method or income method

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.940
minus expenses.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.160
Taxpayers on this system

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.140
are recognized organizations and

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.440
individual entrepreneurs, that

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.860

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.080
the tax code by

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.320
individual entrepreneurs.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.520
In this system of taxation,

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.360
enterprises do not pay value

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.220

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.060
a single social tax.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.880
The exception is those operations

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.400
where enterprises on the

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400
simplified tax

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.620
system act as tax

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.240
agents.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.660
What are these cases?

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:13.020
Payment of income to natural persons.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.160
In this case, the company is obliged

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.400
to transfer from the income paid

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.880
to the budget the income

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.980

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.540
the company leases property

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.560
in state or municipal property.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.940
In this case, the company

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.080
is obliged to transfer the value

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.040

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.340
the rent paid.

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.980
At the same time, the company

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.920
on the simplified taxation

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.660
system pays the following

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.120

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.900
This is the insurance on compulsory

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.960
pension insurance, the single tax itself

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.860
calculated on one or another option

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.420
of calculating the single

01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.920
tax, as well as VAT paid

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.260
when importing goods into the customs

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.820
territory of the Russian Federation,

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.180
as well as some local

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.700
and regional taxes.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.500
This is transport tax, water

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.480
tax, state duties when committing

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.980
some also land tax.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.040
The elements of the simplified

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.940
taxation system are as follows.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.580
The subject of taxation is 1 option

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.300
income, 2 - income minus expenses.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:39.320
Expenses are accepted only

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.320
those that were actually paid by

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.460
the company in the current period.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.140
The tax rate for the first option

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.600
is 6% of the income calculated

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.060
for the reporting period,

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:56.140
and for the second option 15%.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.980
The reporting period of the

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.460
tax system is the first quarter,

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.880
the first half-year, 9 months

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.440
and the tax period - a year.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.740
During the reporting period,

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.500
all enterprises on this tax system

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.980
are obliged to calculate advance

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.700
payments and transfer them

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.500
up to the 25th, that is,

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.400
once a quarter.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:29.170
Consider more in detail the method

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:32.490
of calculating income on the simplified

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.270
system of income taxation.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.010
In this case, the company during

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:40.090
the reporting period is obliged to

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:41.930
keep records of all income

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:45.590
received by the company in one

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.330
form or another, that is, in

01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:51.270
kind and on the settlement account.

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:55.290
At the same time, the method applies

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:59.070
such tax deduction as deduction in the

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:00.610
form of a deduction to the Pension

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:03.850
Fund of the Russian Federation and

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:05.830
also all hospital fees paid in the current

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:08.150
period to employees of this enterprise,

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.350
they will also reduce the amount

01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:13.090
of the single tax.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:17.910
In other words, from the amount of the

01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:21.470
single tax we can deduct these two types

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:22.950
of deductions.

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:25.770
Suppose that in the first

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:28.650
quarter of 2008, the company's revenues

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:32.030
from the sale of services amounted

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.130
to 200 thousand rubles.

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:37.270
The insurance expenses to the Pension Fund

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:39.070
of the Russian Federation, which were charged

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:41.530
under employment contracts with the employee,

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:44.170
the enterprise amounted to 4 thousand

01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:45.430
rubles.

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:48.690
Our company chose the object of taxation,

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:50.370
which was specified in the application

01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:55.110
submitted to the tax authorities,

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:59.210
chose the method of income.

01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:04.970
The amount of the advance

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:06.970
calculated for the first quarter

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:09.230
will be 12 thousand rubles.

01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.630
The amount of expenses to the pension fund

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:18.230
is less than 50% calculated from the amount

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:19.670
of the single tax for the reporting

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:21.250
period.

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:25.550
The amounts of deductions to the

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:27.470
pension fund shall reduce the

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:29.950
amount of the single tax not more

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:36.270
than half of the single tax calculated

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:38.390
and calculated for this reporting

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:39.870
period.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:42.090
In our example, this amount

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:45.310
is less than 50% of the single

01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:48.110
tax amount, so in the end, by April

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:53.370
25, our company must transfer

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:58.030
to the budget of only 8000 rubles.

01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:02.710
If, after any period, an

01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.670
entity has decided to switch

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:09.350
to a taxation system where

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.610
value added tax, income tax,

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.830
property tax is paid for any

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.330
reason, the entity must

01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:18.190
file the application before

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:21.490
15 January of the next

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:27.290
enterprise wants to switch

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:31.250
to the usual taxation system.

01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:33.150
Therefore, such a need

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:34.490
may arise.

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.990
For example, you work

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:40.290
with partners, with that

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:42.190
prefer to enter into

01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:44.570
contracts with value added

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:45.810
tax payers.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.570
As we already know, companies

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:50.370
that are on the simplified taxation

01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:55.810
system are not in the broad

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:59.310
So we can move to the usual taxation

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:00.890
system by submitting

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.650
the appropriate

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.410
applications.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:08.590
It is worth noting that not always

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:10.130
the transition to the usual

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:12.570
tax system with the simplified

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.450
is voluntary.

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:20.310
For example, if your average

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:23.350
number of employees of the enterprise

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.170
exceeds the accounting period,

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:29.150
100 people, or the value of your

01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:31.090
assets exceeds 100 million rubles,

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:34.390
or your income, excluding VAT,

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:41.310
is more than 20 million rubles,

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:43.610
according to the tax legislation

01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:44.790
this enterprise is

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:46.870
subject to the transition

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:49.110
to the usual system

01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:53.290
of taxation out of wish.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:59.760
The next option for calculating

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.060
the single tax of an enterprise

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.640
on the simplified taxation

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.360
system is income minus expenses.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.580
In tax planning, it is very important to

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:16.200
observe the principle of choosing the

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.700
method of income or income minus expenses.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.120
The fact is that it is not always profitable

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:26.360
to apply the income method if your

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.580
expenses are roughly equal to

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.100
income, that is, the profitability is minimal.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.520
In this case, the company chooses the

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.620
method of income minus costs.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.720
It should be noted that expenses

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.980
are recognized only after their

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.160
actual payment, for example,

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.620
through a billing account,

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.440
that is, in cash or cash.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.080
In this case, the single tax is not

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.500
reduced to the contributions to

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.720
the Pension Fund of the Russian

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.980
Federation, but the new concept

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.660
of "minimal tax" is applied.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:06.540
This is a 1% limit below which

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:11.240
you can not pay the budget the

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.700
amount of the single tax.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.080
It is calculated for the

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.980
same reporting period quarterly

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.160
to compare the tax you could

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.340
pay if you reduced

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.920
your income on expenses

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.720
and the minimum tax

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.360
of 1% of your income.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.360
Let us try to compare the effectiveness

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.940
of choosing the object of

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.460
taxation of an enterprise

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:47.140
in a simplified taxation system.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.960
Suppose that our income amounted

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.640
to 5 million rubles in the current

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.640
period, for example, in the first

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.880
quarter of 2008.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.160
Current expenses, which are related to

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.140
payments to individuals, with the

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.440
rental of premises, with transportation

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.860
expenses for the same period,

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.520
amounted to 2 million rubles.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.840
Insurance contributions from payments

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.700
to the pension fund amounted to 200

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:19.100
thousand In this table, the option 1 is

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.340
presented with the method

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:25.000
of taxation income, in the second column

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.880
income minus expenses.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.100
Pay attention to the third line.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.400
In the first case, the amount

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.560
of the single tax will

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.100
be 300 thousand rubles, in

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.900
the second case 450 thousand rubles.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.360
We have the right to reduce the amount

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.680
of the single tax in the first option

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.500
by the amount of deductions made to the

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.860
Pension Fund of the Russian Federation,

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.220
that is, by 150 thousand rubles.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.360
As a result, the total amount of

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.960
the advance payment for this

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.920
reporting period will be only 150 thousand

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.900
rubles.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.300
In the second case, we will have to

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.500
pay the budget of the pension funds

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.700
in addition to the amount of

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:16.440
the single tax.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.720
As a result, as can be seen from

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.840
the table, the second option is less

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.000
profitable than the first, and this

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
is due to profitability.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.720
As I said before, if the company's

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.520
expenses were close to 5 million,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.380
that is, to the income received

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.900
by the company in this reporting

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.500
period, then the second option

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.240
would have more favorable

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.740
conditions for application.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.880
Let us not forget that if our

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.860
expenses were as close as possible

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.340
to the income, then we must pay

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.860
a minimum tax in the case

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.740
of the second option.

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:59.480
And he would be 5 million, multiplied by

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:04.000
1%, 50 thousand rubles.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.480
The simplified tax

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.080
system, without a doubt, has its

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.440
advantages and some disadvantages.

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.360
First, the tax burden may be reduced

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.120
in general because the enterprise

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.680
that is on a simplified taxation

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.640
system does not pay

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.440
property tax, does not pay a single

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.740
social tax, is charged for

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.020
payments, accounting is very

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.580
simplified with the income

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.420
method because there is no need

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:46.680
to keep a account of expenses,

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.780
document them.

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.680
The most important thing for us here is to

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.620
have in mind our receipts on the settlement

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.800
account and in the company's cash.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.820
Tax reporting is also simplified.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.740
We leave two tax declarations for simplification

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:05.340
and contributions to the pension fund of the

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.340
Russian Federation.

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.520
The tax rates are quite low.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.560
The value added tax is 18%

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.200
on the goods and services

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.420
sold, the net income

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.680
tax is 24% and the rate

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.940
of simplification

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:27.160
is 6.15%.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.220
The possibility of choosing the

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:33.100
object of taxation does not depend

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.620
on the legislator, tax authorities.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.660
We have the right to take responsibility

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:42.980
for the choice of the object.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.620
There are also some shortcomings,

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.020
shortcomings or disadvantages

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:53.440
in the use of this system.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.520
So, if we apply the method of income

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.380
minus expenses, it should be remembered

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.820
that the expenses we must calculate

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:02.260
according to the list of

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.020
these expenses presented

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.880
in the chapter on the

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.040
simplified taxation system.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.680
It has a lot of references to

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.840
another chapter on income tax.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.740
Thus, the accountant who is engaged in the

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.680
calculation of the single tax according

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.320
to this system must at least two chapters

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.100
of the tax code, which significantly

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.640
complicates the calculation of the single

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.900
tax according to the results of the

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.080
reporting period.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.300
In addition, not all costs can be

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.880
accepted in principle.

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.440
The list is closed and it is necessary

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.460
to lava and come up with some options

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.640
to simplify the options of costs.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:53.980
The Russian Federation is a

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:55.760
system of single tax on fixed

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.880
income.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.320
The rules for calculating the single

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:05.760
tax on this system are specified in

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.280
Chapter 26.3 of the Tax Code.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:14.320
With this system of tax accounting,

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.540
we are also not

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.740
payers, as with the

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.180
simplified system of taxation

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.260
of some types of taxes, such

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.440
as income tax, value

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.120
added tax, property tax

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.400
and single social tax.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.300
At the same time, the enterprises

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:36.900
pay insurance costs on compulsory

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:40.120
pension insurance, single

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.360
tax as such, value added

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.480
tax, transport tax

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.520
paid when imported

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.440
and some other local taxes

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.280
and fees, as well as on

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.020
the simplified taxation system.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:59.820
Enterprises, if they are

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:04.060
tax agents, in particular,

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:08.080
if they pay, make payments

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.680
to their employees, then

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.780
they act as tax agents

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.840
of income taxes for individuals,

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.040
if they rent a room

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.280
from state or municipal

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.620
institutions, they

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.880
are also VAT

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.140
payers.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.240
Taxpayers of this tax are organizations

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.700
of entrepreneurs who

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.000
carry out certain types

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.440
of activities specified in

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.760
the tax code, according

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.720
to which in some regions

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.800
this system has been

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.700
introduced legislatively.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.220
Thus, the transition to the payment

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.060
of a single tax on the assigned income

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.500
is not optional.

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.240
It is mandatory for all and

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.100
entrepreneurs who carry

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.600
out certain types of activities.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.760
Such activities include retail

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.940
trade through bins, tents, kiosks

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:11.020
that do not have their own shopping

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.740
areas, car freight transportation,

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.160
as well as passenger transportation,

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.060
by those enterprises in which

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.700
the number of cars

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.460
does not exceed

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.140
20 units.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.680
Car service services, household

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.080
services are also subject

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.480
to a single tax on income,

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:47.300
but also some other more

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.220
rare activities,

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.120
you Tax Code.

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.860
The object of taxation of the single

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.960
tax system on the assigned income

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.120
is the assigned income,

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.940
determined for each type

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.580
of activity separately.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.680
It should be noted that an enterprise

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.960
may be simultaneously a payer

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.820
of the single tax on the imposed

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.340
income if it, for example,

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.160
carries out cargo transportation

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.020
and the amount of motor

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.500
vehicles on the balance sheet

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.920
or rented by this enterprise

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.000
less than 20 units, less

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.720
than 20 vehicles, it may also

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.160
be a payer of basic taxes

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.100
if it carries out

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.180
other types of activities.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.400
I will give a small example.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.040
The company produces furniture,

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.540
has its own production, its

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.820
own building.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:55.180
The number of units of motor vehicles

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.860
carried on its own vehicles

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.200
up to 20 for example 15 cars, so

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:04.160
the amounts received for the

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:09.160
sale of furniture must be reflected

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.120
by the general system of taxation,

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.580
that is, this enterprise

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.480
will pay VAT, will pay income

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.880
tax, a single social tax on payments

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.740
to employees of this furniture enterprise

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.680
and at the same time on the activities

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.420
related to the transportation

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:29.100
of finished products in

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.520
the form of furniture

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.580
to buyers, will be taxed by

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.020
the rates of the single

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:39.420
tax on the tax on the

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.600
taxable income, if this

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.040
tax is legally introduced

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.340
in this region.

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:54.140
The rate is currently 15%.

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:59.020
This rate is imposed on the income

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.260
that has been established for

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.500
this particular type of activity.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:09.740
The tax base in any reporting

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:13.220
period does not depend on the

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.520
income actually received.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.220
It depends on the physical

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.020
indicator for the specific

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.080
type of activity and the

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.400
basic return established by law.

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.020
The physical indicator

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.580
is set specifically for each

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.180
type of activity, for

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.020
example, for retail, it will

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:37.280
be the area on which

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.540
sales are made.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.660
For retail trade, this area

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.100
must be at least 150 square

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.160
meters.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.260
At this area, a single tax on

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.720
the income is calculated.

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.660
If the area exceeds 150 square

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.540
meters, then the general

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:57.840
tax system is applied.

01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.920
The physical indicator for

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.260
the activity on freight transportation

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:08.840
will be the number of vehicles.

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.080
The physical indicator for

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.140
passenger transportation will

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.640
be the number of passenger seats.

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:21.240
Since 2008, such activities as land

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.800
lease for the organization of a trading

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.300
network, retail trade, for the

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:29.080
installation of tents, kiosks have

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.400
been transferred to a single tax

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.260
on the assigned income.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.200
The reporting period of this tax

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.820
is the first quarter, the first

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.600
half-year, 9 months, and the tax

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.460
period is considered a year.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:53.960
With this system, the payment of advance

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.320
payments, which are taken into account when calculating

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.160
the single tax on the end of the year,

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.480
is also introduced.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.420
The payment period is the 25th of the

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.900
month following the reporting quarter.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.820
Let us take a small example of calculating

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.720
the tax of an enterprise on a single

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.120
tax on the assigned income.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.560
Our farm provides household services.

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.580
In the region where our company

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:25.500
operates, the basic Revenue on household

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.920
services is 7500 rubles

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.040
per month.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.480
For the calculation of the single

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.020
tax we must take into account

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.700
the number of employees of this enterprise,

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.920
for example, in January 2008

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.940
the number of employees of our

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.140
enterprise was 3 people, in February

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.480
7, and in March already 8 people.

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.500
The tax base for the current

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.140
period, i.e. for the first quarter

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:53.440
of 2008, will be calculated

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.640
as follows.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.900
Basic return of 7500 rubles, multiplied

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:04.900
by the number of employees of the enterprise

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.280
and the adjusting coefficients

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.720
of the basic return established

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.580
in this region, will show that in

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.220
the first quarter of 2008 the enterprise

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:20.880
will have to pay the effect

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.080
of the application of the ENOVD,

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.860
that is, the single tax on the

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.980
incurred income, is

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.880
quite obvious.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:37.720
Because the amount of the single

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.580
tax does not depend on income

01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:42.660
and expenses, it is possible

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:46.900
to significantly save on wages or

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.460
the number of accounting employees

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:53.880
involved in the process of registration

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.220
of financial business

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:59.300
operations of this enterprise.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.520
Also easily filled in tax declaration,

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.160
which should only indicate the

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.100
amount of the single tax, which

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:11.200
in the same way as the method of application

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:19.000
of income in the application of

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.380
the simplified taxation system

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.580
we can reduce by the amount of

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.960
the budget deductions listed

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.800
in the pension fund for the

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.420
reporting period.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.560
However, the disadvantages also need to

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.020
be taken into account, as the effect is

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.980
achieved with a fairly good revenue.

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.940
In other words, if you have

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.940
set your base return within a certain

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:47.060
limit, which is a constant value

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:50.680
throughout the tax period, and

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.880
your revenue does not reach the

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.660
expected results, for example,

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:00.220
your trading point is not in

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.960
a very convenient place, then

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.380
the effect of the application

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.040
may be reduced to zero.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.340
How to do this, we will look at

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.380
in more detail in the following sections

01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.300
of our program.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.760
The effectiveness of running your

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.320
business and the duration of

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.920
your company's activities, as you

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.620
already realized, probably depends

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:55.880
on the correct choice of the tax system.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.460
The system of taxation, as well as the

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.380
procedure for calculating certain

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.420
taxes and fees, is reflected in the

01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:05.600
accounting policy of the enterprise,

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.560
which is approved literally on

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:09.520
each enterprise.

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.860
It does not matter what

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:14.880
tax system this organization operates.

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:17.360
Therefore, many employees of the

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.860
company, as well as external

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:22.100
users of the reporting policy,

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.120
must understand.

01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:28.280
These include the head of an organization

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.140
that approves this accounting policy

01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:33.400
in the form of an order, the

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.740
chief accountant who develops methods

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.780
and techniques for calculating the

01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:42.600
tax base, the founder who forms

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.360
the structure of the direction,

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.500
the basis of the business, the

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.560
internal auditor who is responsible

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.200
for verifying the accounting policy

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.140
for compliance with the methods

01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.800
and techniques, options established

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.700
by the legislation, the financial

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.180
director who is responsible

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.340
for optimizing cash flows and

01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.400
reducing or redistributing

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:15.300
depending on the volumes

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.920
of tax payments.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.620
The accounting policy should

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.460
be understood and the tax inspector,

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.540
who considers the accounting policy

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:29.360
when calculating the tax choices

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.780
presented by the enterprise

01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:34.600
in the tax declaration.

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.640
Thus, when drawing up accounting

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.880
policies, employees of the

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:44.100
company are interested in successful

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:48.420
business development.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.800
If you apply a general tax

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.140
system, the main element

01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:57.960
of tax planning will

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:01.360
be the income tax.

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:03.500
It is here that there are many options,

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.460
techniques, recognition and accounting

01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:10.420
of income expenses.

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.000
The main elements of the income

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.780
tax are income and expenses.

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.440
Income under the general system

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.120
of taxation includes, in particular,

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.940
income from the sale of the products

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.740
produced by the company, the

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.540
works performed or the services rendered,

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.620
the property received free of charge

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.940
or the works and services rendered to

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:37.020
you free of charge, income in the form

01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:39.280
of penalties, which were charged

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:43.460
in violation of the terms

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.600
of the economic contracts of your

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.000
counterparty, interest in the

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:52.620
form of interest on the balance

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.460
of funds on your settlement account

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:58.040
or interest on the other enterprises

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.140
issued by you, in one form

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:05.020
or another.

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:10.100
Thus, it is possible to regulate, knowing

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:16.240
the options for receiving income and the

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.620
order of taxation of these incomes,

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.200
the enterprise can plan the receipt

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:24.040
of revenue and the outflow of money

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:28.640
in the form of taxes to the budget.

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.380
The second element of income

01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.120
tax planning is expenses.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.160
In this case, the tax code

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.560
presents a very wide range of options.

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.120
For example, if you rent a

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:45.280
room, then the costs in the

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.780
form of rent can be taken into account

01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.800
in the tax base when calculating

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:59.020
one of the three options.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.100
The first option is on the date of

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:03.700
submission of documents to you from

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.880
the tenant, the second option is on the

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.960
last day of the reporting period and the

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:11.340
third option is on the date of settlements

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:14.580
with the tenant.

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:20.180
If you know that you will not be

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:22.600
a regular payer of rent, it is desirable

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.780
to save tax payments when calculating

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.100
the method to choose the method

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:33.560
of recognition of income in

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:38.080
the form of rent on the date

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:41.760
of presentation to you documents.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.880
The next important and

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.620
most common point of

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:51.940
tax planning is tax planning

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:56.580
with the application of the

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:58.780
simplified tax system.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.380
As we have already considered

01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:04.600
before, the main element and choice

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:09.080
of your business should be planning

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.860
your income and expenses, calculating

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.560
profitability, which affects the

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.120
choice of the object of taxation

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.360
under this system and which

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.100
you are not entitled to change

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.760
during the tax period.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:27.160
In other words, if you have submitted

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.820
a statement to the tax inspectorate

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.700
before November 30 that you wish to

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.120
calculate income, for example,

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.700
by the method of income minus expenses,

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:43.400
you are entitled to change your choice

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.700
only within 20 days, that is, only

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:49.700
until December 20 of this year, preceding

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.440
the application of the simplified

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.380
taxation system, and during

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:57.080
the year of application of the

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.940
simplified system you are

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:05.260
not entitled to make any adjustments.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:09.080
You, based on the choice of

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.780
the object of taxation in the

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:13.400
simplified taxation system, should

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.580
make your contracts, not

01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:20.140
sales, but intermediary, to

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.380
organize the documents of turnover

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:23.720
accordingly.

01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:28.380
If you chose the object

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.040
of taxation "Income", then for you,

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.900
the documents related to expenses

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.340
will not be as important as when

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:39.120
choosing another option, which

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.900
works with the simplified

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.420
taxation system.

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:48.060
Due to the fact that with the income method

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.220
on the simplified system

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.840
of taxation the amount of the single

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.040
tax you have the right to reduce the

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.380
accrual to the Pension Fund of

01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.280
the Russian Federation on

01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.740
the accrual payments to your

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:02.640
employees Tax planning in this case

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.160
is closely related to the tracking

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.100
of timeliness of payment of

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:13.760
deductions to the pension fund.
