00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Good afternoon. My name is Anton Kalabin. I am the owner of several companies and an advisor to strategic management of a number of large companies in Russia.

00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
When we think about how to manage business or any other human community as effectively as possible, the word charisma is very often used.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And today we will talk about charisma, about leadership.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
When people say the word charisma, there is often a complete misunderstanding. Everyone means their own thing under this word.

00:36.000 --> 00:48.000
In general, if you look at the historical retrospective, then charisma is an ancient Greek word that takes its origin in church practice.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
In Greek, charisma is translated as a gift from God.

00:53.000 --> 01:12.000
In church analogues, it is described that each person has a gift from God from birth, which includes his or her personality, ability to perform various specific actions.

01:12.000 --> 01:25.000
It is claimed that if a person is endowed with some divine gift, then he must use it for his purpose. And not using God's gift, charisma, is a sin.

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
From this point of view, the approach is very correct. It motivates people to use it if they succeed.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
Max Weber introduced a slightly different definition of charisma in scientific practice.

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
Under charisma, he meant a person who possessed an exceptional set of supernatural qualities.

01:49.000 --> 02:06.000
Thus, according to Max Weber, people, seeing or attributing to a person exceptional qualities, were ready to follow this person wherever he would say, obey his orders without any additional motivators.

02:07.000 --> 02:18.000
Now, when people say the word charisma, there is often a confusion with the public, with the fame, with the qualities of a showman.

02:18.000 --> 02:28.000
Of course, and we will analyze this a little later, the ability to communicate in public is generally one of the necessary qualities of a leader.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
However, it is not decisive. If a person is famous and public, it does not mean that he is charismatic. But this is my opinion.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Let's try to approach this issue from a scientific point of view.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
Most people, when they start to discuss what charisma is and what to do with it, make a standard mistake.

02:50.000 --> 03:00.000
They begin to argue about the structure of this phenomenon without setting its functionality, without naming, without defining the circle of phenomena that this term describes.

03:00.000 --> 03:16.000
Such a definition in science is called functional. And only by defining the circle of phenomena that we call this term, we can proceed to the study of how it all happens, what this phenomenon consists of.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
The internal structure of a phenomenon is described by a structural definition.

03:23.000 --> 03:41.000
And only after we assign this phenomenon, this term, to the functional, we have defined its internal structure, only after that we can start research work to be able to predict how this phenomenon will happen in the future.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
That is, we start making a model. The third definition is called a model.

03:49.000 --> 03:58.000
Let's see how this approach works in the description of such a well-known phenomenon as electricity.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
When the ancient Greeks first encountered the phenomenon of electricity, they called it the word electro.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Electro from the ancient Greek entary.

04:10.000 --> 04:24.000
That is, they simply assigned a certain term to what they observed, the phenomenon of the attraction of woolen hairs to the entary after they were lost from each other.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
Having designated this circle of phenomena, they were able to understand what it consists of.

04:32.000 --> 04:41.000
They began to describe. As a result, it became possible to study what materials can be lost from each other so that this phenomenon occurs, what materials cannot.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
That is, when this phenomenon occurs, when it does not.

04:45.000 --> 04:54.000
After a large enough empirical material was accumulated, people began to come up with various hypotheses, to give model definitions.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
At first, the models were quite primitive.

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
The hypothesis was that electricity is some liquid that flows from one substance to another.

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
Now we are working with the model definition that electricity is a stream of charged particles.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
And the presence of these particles, their concentration in a certain physical body, determines its electrical properties.

05:23.000 --> 05:32.000
If we talk about charisma, then it is important for us to first determine what functionality this word describes.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
If we give a strict scientific definition of functionality, it will sound as follows.

05:44.000 --> 05:53.000
Charisma is the ability to influence people through positive social motivation.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And now a few words about what it means.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Motivation is the incitement of people to do something.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
In this case, the word positive social motivation indicates that we do not consider material motivation.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
That is, we say that this is not a commodity-money relationship, not a relationship of paid with the deed.

06:15.000 --> 06:24.000
When we talk about positive social motivation, we say that this is not a compulsion, that is, it is not the use of violence.

06:25.000 --> 06:34.000
If a person uses violence to force another person to do something, he uses social motivation, that is, he does not pay him.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
He does not pay in any way, no matter whether with material or other resources.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
But at the same time, he acts through negative social motivation, he forces him.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
So, charisma is the ability to influence people through positive social motivation.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the word ability is used here.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
And here we can divide two extremely important concepts, which are very often confused, by the way.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Leadership and charisma.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
So, charisma is a potential, it is an ability to influence, and leadership is the process itself.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
That is, it is impossible to be a leader without charisma.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
However, you can have charisma and not be a leader.

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
A charismatic person, who is able to potentially influence people, may not use this potential if he does not want to.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
He may hide and not show his leadership qualities.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
So, leadership is a process of influence.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
Naturally, here we are also talking about influence through positive social motivation.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
All other influence is no longer leadership, it is another way of managing people.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
So, leadership is a process of influence through positive social motivation.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
Accordingly, a leader in this approach is a subject of influence.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
That is, the one who actually carries out the process of leadership.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Actor.

08:10.000 --> 08:18.000
If we try to reformulate the definition of charisma a little and make it simpler and more understandable,

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
the definition of charisma will sound as follows.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
This is the definition that I use in my practice all the time.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Charisma is the ability to persuade and lead.

08:31.000 --> 08:39.000
By working with this definition, we can move on to the structural definition of charisma.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
We need to understand what properties this phenomenon has.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
In fact, there are not so many important properties for us.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
There are only three.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
The first property is visible from the definition that we have just made.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
This is the dual nature of charisma.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Look carefully at the previous definition.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
It consists of two parts.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
The first part is the ability to persuade.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
The second part is the ability to lead.

09:11.000 --> 09:20.000
Now try to remember several people you know who can persuade but cannot lead.

09:28.000 --> 09:37.000
Most likely, people who can persuade and cannot lead will be people who can be called specialists,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
scientists, advisors, consultants.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
Now try to remember people, maybe not even your close friends,

09:47.000 --> 09:56.000
but some famous people who can persuade almost no one, but can lead well.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
Most likely, politicians, sports team captains, agitators of all kinds will come here.

10:05.000 --> 10:16.000
Now try to remember people who can persuade and lead.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Most likely, there are not so many people you can remember.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
And almost all of them can be combined in one word.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
These are leaders.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
These leaders can be business leaders, political or public.

10:31.000 --> 10:42.000
But we can call those people who can persuade and lead.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
One shoulder does not work.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
Only if both shoulders are included, then a leader appears.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
A person who can be called by this word.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
The second characteristic of charisma, which is no less important than the first, is its relativity.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
You can evaluate whether a person is charismatic or not by your experience.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
We can judge only when we have a pair that interacts, a person and his audience.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Without asking the audience, we cannot say whether a person is charismatic or not.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
Only when we know who we measure this quality with, we can say this.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
In the definition of charisma, there is a word influence.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
This is someone, a subject, who influences someone.

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
Until there is at least one of these parts, we cannot say whether this ability exists or not.

11:44.000 --> 11:55.000
Therefore, the term is usually used for politicians who work with a large electorate.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
The second side of this interaction is asked by default.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
However, if you really want to use charisma to improve the quality of your own life,

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
you must always remember that this concept is relative.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
Every time you want to influence someone, you must understand that this audience,

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
even if it is just one person, can be very different from another.

12:21.000 --> 12:31.000
The words you use to influence the qualities you need to influence a young girl

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
are completely different from the qualities you need to influence a graduate professor.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
But in general.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
Although, of course, there are some basic things that affect everyone.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
We will return to them a little later.

12:46.000 --> 12:57.000
So, try to imagine what qualities you need to influence your colleagues.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
Those people who do not obey you directly and those who cannot command you.

13:03.000 --> 13:17.000
Try to write down 2-3 qualities that can enhance your ability to influence them.

13:17.000 --> 13:29.000
Now draw a line and write down 2-3 qualities that will allow you to effectively influence

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
an audience like 4-year-old children in a kindergarten.

13:34.000 --> 13:42.000
Compare the results.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
After that, compare how similar the 2-3 qualities you wrote down in the first and second case turned out to be.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Most likely, there will be no 100% match.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
It seems to me.

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
So, every time you want to gain the ability to influence an audience,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
it is important for you to clearly understand what kind of audience it is.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Describe it clearly.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
Of course, over time, when you train, you will be able to do it faster and more unconsciously.

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
But at least in the beginning, in order to use this tool effectively and to its intended purpose,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
you need to go through certain stages.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
At the end, we will give you a complete algorithm, we will derive it in a clear form.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
But now remember, the most important thing before you start influencing someone,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
you need to understand who exactly you want to influence now.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
And what unique qualities this community, this audience, describes.

14:46.000 --> 14:54.000
So, the second characteristic of charisma that we must constantly remember is its relativity.

14:54.000 --> 15:04.000
If you want, try to look at what will be the difference between you and such audiences as,

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
for example, scientists at the International Conference on Sociobiology

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
and miners with helmets sitting on a stone bridge and knocking on them.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
There is another characteristic of charisma, the basic characteristic of which I highlight,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
this is its multifacetedness.

15:28.000 --> 15:36.000
We already touched on this a little when we talked about the fact that different qualities can be required for different audiences.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
So, a huge number of factors affect each of the audiences.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
When we study this issue in training, lists of 20, 30, 40 items appear.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And this is not the limit.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
You can continue this list indefinitely,

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
practically describe the characteristics of a personality that help it influence other people.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
However, we can structure the list a little,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
and combine them into several important groups.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
So, the first group is the most obvious, it is professional qualities.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
If a person is a specialist, then along with other people who work in this specialty,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
use this skill.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
If he has this skill well, he will be respected.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
If he has a bad personality, he will be criticized.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
If he has this skill well, he will be respected.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
That is, he will have the opportunity to convince, at least.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
So, if we talk about the ability to convince,

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
then we need to have at least professional competence.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
The second group is something that professional competence cannot be realized without.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
This is the ability to communicate.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
If a person knows how to do it, knows how to do it right, but is not able to express it,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
is not able to tell people about it,

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
then he will not even be able to realize his ability to convince.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
If a person knows how to communicate well,

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
knows the basic laws of social interaction between people,

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
understands how to build his speech, where to start, where to end,

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
at what point it is better to send a call to the audience,

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
then he will be able to lead.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
And the third group of factors is behavior.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
A person must behave like a leader.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
He must be perceived as a leader, he must be like him.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Here, of course, we will take confidence in ourselves

17:48.000 --> 17:56.000
and the algorithms that a person uses when communicating with other people.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
How does he behave?

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
How to behave correctly, you need to work separately

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
and look at the next point of our work

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
how, by what laws, you need to behave correctly.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
So, the third property of charisma sounds like multifacetedness.

18:18.000 --> 18:26.000
And charisma is a simple sum of all the factors that exist.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
Of course, not a single person is able to have all the properties that are possible.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
In principle, this is impossible.

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
However, we can work purposefully and consciously on the development of each of these qualities.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
Try to write down for yourself the qualities that you consider the most important from your target audience.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
For example, for your loved ones, for your family, or for your boss.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
And then, according to each of these qualities, I assure you,

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
there are certain methods, books, literature, coaches, teachers

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
that will help you develop this quality.

19:08.000 --> 19:17.000
And so, by working on each of the qualities separately, you increase the total amount of your charisma.

19:17.000 --> 19:25.000
As a result, your ability to influence other people through positive social motivation becomes higher.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
As a result, you will be able to persuade and lead much better.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
So, we have drawn up three main properties of charisma.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
First, it is its dual nature.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
In order to be charismatic, you need to be able to persuade and lead.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
We found out that charisma is a relative concept.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
And in order to find out whether this ability exists or not,

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
you need to ask the subject and the object, the actor and his target audience.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
And we found out that charisma is a multifactorial concept.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Now, when we have both functional and structural definitions of charisma,

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
we can try to create a model of this phenomenon,

20:13.000 --> 20:21.000
on the basis of which we will be able to or will try to predict our own behavior

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
and find out what qualities, what factors and how to apply them

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
so that your ability to influence people grows and increases.

20:34.000 --> 20:41.000
So, psychology tells us that a person often acts unconsciously,

20:41.000 --> 20:49.000
that most of the actions of a person are determined by those ancient behavioral structures

20:49.000 --> 20:57.000
that were embedded in him by nature for many millennia of his development.

20:57.000 --> 21:07.000
For a very long time, people lived, pro-people, lived in the form of certain flocks.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
These flocks had a certain social organization.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
And this social organization has been preserved for millennia,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
thus being recorded in our ancient memory.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
How were these primary primitive communities arranged?

21:25.000 --> 21:34.000
If we look at the existing flocks of primates today,

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
the flock of chimpanzees will be the closest to the pro-human flock.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
It consists of the following parts.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
There are many children who are raised together.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
There are several females who make up the harem.

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
And there is the main male, the supreme leader of this community.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
A large adult male.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
There are no other adult males in this community.

22:09.000 --> 22:20.000
As the boys grow up, when they reach puberty, they are driven out of this community, from this flock.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
And so there is a clear division into three levels.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
This is the alpha male, the supreme dominant in this community.

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
These are the beta females, those who occupy the second layer in the hierarchy.

22:38.000 --> 22:48.000
And the gamma males, those who do nothing, do not solve anything, and their main task is to grow.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
Look at the roles distributed in this community.

22:54.000 --> 23:03.000
Almost all the leadership is concentrated in the hands of the alpha male.

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
He performs a very important function for his flock.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
And for this, the flock is completely subordinate to him.

23:18.000 --> 23:32.000
Over time, when some events occur, the male turns on and saves, protects his flock from external threats.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
He also organizes so that the flock does not die of hunger.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
His task is to get food or organize the food production.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
His task is to ensure that the individuals inside the flock do not quarrel.

23:46.000 --> 23:53.000
So that the conflicts that arise inside end well.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
In fact, he is the supreme judge and distributor of those material benefits that the flock has.

24:02.000 --> 24:14.000
If the flock needs to make an important decision, it is he who decides what decision will be made and where the flock will go.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
Is it time to go to the winter camp? Is it time to make supplies?

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
Do you need to move to the other side of the river or stay in the same place?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
All this is decided by the alpha male.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
As a result, a very interesting construction is obtained.

24:31.000 --> 24:40.000
In order for this system to work, all members of the flock must unconditionally submit to the alpha male.

24:40.000 --> 24:48.000
If they do not obey him 100%, then this will worsen the possibilities of this community for survival.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
If the decision is made, it must be executed without prejudice.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Any doubts reduce the possibility of the flock for survival.

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
If the alpha male says that he needs to go to the other side of the river, and the flock remains on the same bank,

25:05.000 --> 25:14.000
or just stayed for a while, it is already deprived of the protection of the alpha male and can be eaten by other predators.

25:15.000 --> 25:30.000
If the alpha male organized a group hunting, but some hunters did not listen to him and left the places where they were assigned,

25:30.000 --> 25:40.000
then the prey can run out through these holes in the hunting structure and the flock can be left without food.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
Accordingly, the chances of survival are worsened.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Therefore, only those flocks survived as a result of the long evolution,

25:50.000 --> 26:00.000
in which all individuals who are not alpha males took over the alpha male unconditionally, without discussion.

26:00.000 --> 26:07.000
Fortunately or unfortunately, this ancient construct is present in us.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Thus, it turns out a very interesting thing.

26:11.000 --> 26:19.000
If we see in someone a certain quality of this primitive alpha male,

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
we want to obey him without any doubt, without any criticism.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
We want to believe him. We begin to trust him absolutely instinctively.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
So, our model definition at this stage sounds like this.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
The one who looks like a father has charisma.

26:39.000 --> 26:49.000
Before we write these signs, let's remember again what functions the father performs in such a flock.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
The first and most important function is that he protects his flock.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
The second and no less important function is that he provides food and resources.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
The third function is that he judges and distributes.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
He does not allow conflicts to enter, which could end badly.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
He is the highest justice.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
He will decide.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
And the fourth, the last and most important function,

27:23.000 --> 27:32.000
which is performed by a leader in any community and a father in any flock, is to direct.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
He directs the flock. He decides where and who will go.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
The community has a goal.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
These are the four main functions.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
Now let's see how the father performed these functions.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
What qualities allowed him to do it well.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
So, high growth.

27:55.000 --> 28:01.000
I think that it is not necessary to explain how the physical strength allows you to perform all four functions.

28:01.000 --> 28:10.000
It is especially important for distribution, so that no one has the desire to redistribute the production.

28:10.000 --> 28:20.000
In addition to strength, a person who claims to perform the highest function should be healthy.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
We can give a lot of examples of very strong people, but not very healthy.

28:25.000 --> 28:32.000
It should be noted that in the charismatic influence, this is reflected quite strongly.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
People tend to leave the function of persuasion to not very healthy people.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
These are the so-called patriarchs.

28:41.000 --> 28:50.000
Any developed community contains such people in order to receive wise advice from them.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
But no one will follow them on an emotional call.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
That is, they are left to the role of experts.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
Therefore, in order to be a full-fledged strong leader,

29:02.000 --> 29:09.000
it is necessary to demonstrate not only physical strength, but also health.

29:09.000 --> 29:19.000
The fourth quality I would like to mention is a very important, but not immediately obvious, quality of the father.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
This is a low voice.

29:21.000 --> 29:28.000
Usually, when we get to this point in training, a legal question arises.

29:28.000 --> 29:38.000
Not all leaders have high growth, physical strength, physical health, and a low voice.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.000
At this point, it is very useful to go back a little and remember that charisma is a multifactorial concept.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
We have just started writing this list.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
There are still a lot of factors.

29:51.000 --> 29:59.000
If a person does not have physical health, he can compensate for it through other properties.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.000
And, by the way, thank God, all these factors are physical.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
Accordingly, modern means of communication allow you to play off many of these qualities.

30:13.000 --> 30:21.000
Thus, directors and operators shoot the low-ranking leaders from below, thereby visually increasing their growth.

30:21.000 --> 30:33.000
The information about the illnesses and health of political leaders is usually, to put it mildly, slightly distorted and more optimistic.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
The voice is modulated on a special equipment.

30:40.000 --> 30:50.000
With the help of long editing and long work of specialists, the leader's speech can be more smooth, more literate.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
The speech can be more concise, more clear, and the speech can be more clear.

30:55.000 --> 31:03.000
Special people try to teach the leader how to move correctly, how to work on camera.

31:03.000 --> 31:14.000
And probably the most provocative sign that I would like to give you today is that an alpha male is a man.

31:14.000 --> 31:28.000
No matter how offensive and a little annoying it is to the ladies, according to the model of charisma, according to the model of the ancient property of human influence on a man,

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
men have a slightly greater chance of making this influence.

31:33.000 --> 31:41.000
This is just one of the factors, thank God, and far from the most important.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
There are many factors, and the most important one is very relative.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Therefore, women can also be charismatic leaders.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
It's just that one of their qualities is practically closed.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
Although, on the other hand, look at the women who try to play the role of a leader.

32:00.000 --> 32:07.000
What are they doing? How are they trying to reduce the influence of this factor?

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
They stop wearing high heels.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
They use minimal jewelry.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
Haircuts. Long hair has always been an archetypal feature of women.

32:20.000 --> 32:26.000
Now, a lot of women, the vast majority of women, prefer short haircuts.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
This also allows them to look more like men.

32:30.000 --> 32:42.000
The standard of beauty among women is a slim, dry figure with unclearly expressed female forms.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
This is also a way to look a little more like a man than a little less like a woman.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
If we look at each of the parameters, there are always ways to correct.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
By the way, about heels. High height.

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
In principle, by wearing heels, you can increase your height.

33:04.000 --> 33:16.000
Wide heels allow you to combine the improvement of your parameters in terms of high height and not be too feminine.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.000
A thin hairpin, of course, although increases height, but emphasizes femininity too much.

33:22.000 --> 33:34.000
So, we looked at a fairly simple model of how a potential charismatic leader should behave and how he should look.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Let's go a little deeper.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
Let's look at the so-called social distance system.

33:49.000 --> 33:58.000
We will call the social distance the number of similarities that two people have.

33:58.000 --> 34:09.000
The commonalities of interests, manners of behavior, common rituals, common acquaintances, common interests.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Everything that people have in common reduces their social distance.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
The social distance between them.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
Everything that people have in common increases the social distance.

34:20.000 --> 34:28.000
If someone loves ballet, and another loves theater, then the social distance between them is quite large.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
It is not infinitely large, because both of these people love art.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
But at the same time, it is large enough, because these are different types of art.

34:36.000 --> 34:46.000
However, this social distance between them will be smaller than, for example, the distance between a football fan and a classical music lover.

34:46.000 --> 34:59.000
Thus, having looked at all the parameters, all the qualities, we can imagine a certain social distance between two people.

35:00.000 --> 35:09.000
The minimum distance, for example, will be between brothers who have a small age difference, grew up in the same family,

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
were raised by the same parents, went to the same school.

35:14.000 --> 35:22.000
There will be a very small social distance between them, because they are very similar in many ways and know a lot about each other.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
This is also an important aspect of social distance.

35:26.000 --> 35:34.000
The amount of information we know about another person is proportional to the social distance between us.

35:34.000 --> 35:43.000
So, people who have a very small social distance between them, we will call brothers.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
Brothers, sisters, gender in this case does not matter.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
These are people who are very similar to each other.

35:52.000 --> 36:01.000
In principle, by analogy with the ancient Prostai, we can say that these are the gamma of children who are there.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
It is not necessary to be children in life to have small social distances.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
The social distance between spouses is usually quite small.

36:13.000 --> 36:22.000
Between colleagues who have a close career, do about the same job, obey the same manager,

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
there is also a lot of similarity between them, they will also be brothers.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
The social distance between them is small.

36:31.000 --> 36:38.000
If the social distance between people is very large, if two people know very little about each other,

36:38.000 --> 36:46.000
or practically know nothing, if they have different interests, even if they do not know each other,

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
but have different interests, diametrically opposite,

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
we can say that these people have nothing in common.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
The social distance between them is large.

36:56.000 --> 37:03.000
Starting from a certain social distance, we will call people strangers to each other.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
In order to understand how the mechanisms of charisma, the mechanisms of leadership work,

37:09.000 --> 37:18.000
how people can influence each other, we need to look at the middle layer that is between brothers and strangers.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
Why? A stranger cannot influence us in any way.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
He is not significant to us in principle, by definition.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
We consider him a stranger.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
The first reaction he will cause us will be a reaction of caution.

37:36.000 --> 37:44.000
Any attempt to influence us will cause us fear, caution,

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
and we will look at him for a long time before we start listening to him.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
On the other hand, if a person eats with us from the same bowl,

37:56.000 --> 38:03.000
then it is also unnatural for us to try to control him or listen to him,

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
because we are in the same social position.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
Accordingly, whenever one of the brothers tries to command,

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
in response he will receive a reaction, and why did you actually command here?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Who gave you this right?

38:19.000 --> 38:27.000
Those who have a small social distance between themselves cannot be in a power relationship by definition.

38:27.000 --> 38:43.000
This is the reason why the vast majority of consultants in management do not advise managers to enter close social contacts with subordinates.

38:44.000 --> 38:52.000
This is the case when it is said that it is harmful and bad to take friends and relatives to work,

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
because it is much more difficult to manage these people than people taken from the outside.

38:59.000 --> 39:09.000
So, we have a zone of short social distances, where those who are inside are called brothers,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
and there is an external zone called strangers.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
What is between them? Let's see.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
So, we have a zone of short social distances.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
This plane is a plane of social distances.

39:23.000 --> 39:30.000
The closer the points are located to each other, the smaller the social distance between objects.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
So, there is a central circle that is around you.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
You are in the center.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
You or the target audience.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Let's really call it the target audience.

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
So, there are those around it who know very well about it,

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
those about whom the target audience is very well known and in many ways similar.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
These people form an internal circle called brothers.

39:54.000 --> 40:00.000
Those who are outside the external large circle, we have already talked about, are called strangers.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Who will be inside?

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
Those who are not strangers are not yet brothers.

40:10.000 --> 40:21.000
If we imagine that this scale has two directions, positive and negative,

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
then we can easily decide who is where.

40:25.000 --> 40:32.000
So, if we have an object that we know well about,

40:32.000 --> 40:38.000
but it is separated from us quite strongly in the negative direction,

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
how do you think the target audience will treat such an object?

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Here, the target audience will be bank employees.

40:46.000 --> 40:54.000
People in suits, with ties, always in white starched shirts,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
with their shoes cleaned out.

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
People for whom a formal label is a very defining and strict requirement.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
Now, let's imagine a person they know,

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
for example, their client, a worker of the client's company,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
who came to them for some ordinary negotiations.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
How will they treat him if he differs from them in clothing,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and differs in the negative direction?

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
How can you tell the clothing from the negative direction from bank employees?

41:26.000 --> 41:33.000
Well, probably, it's some torn jeans,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
some kind of free-style shirt with flowers,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
stretched to the waist,

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
some kind of earring, earrings in the ears,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
a thick gold bracelet,

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
and some kind of sneakers on the feet.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
How will the bank employees treat such an object?

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
He differs from them in the negative direction,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
but he is not one of them.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
So, they will treat him in a very negative way.

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
And most likely, they will not go to a deal with such a person.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
That is, the communication that will go to this person will be very negative.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Such a person turns into a person of the perverse nature.

42:20.000 --> 42:27.000
The same applies to any rather weak person in any community.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
Since, according to most significant signs, he differs in the negative direction,

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
he is weaker, he has a weaker voice, he is short,

42:37.000 --> 42:44.000
he looks more like a girl, he does not have any significant achievements.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
I am talking about a male community.

42:48.000 --> 42:55.000
Any such person becomes a pervert, he is humiliated, humiliated, offended.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
This is a place of perversion.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
What will happen to a person who stands out in the positive direction?

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
Who is a little smarter, a little taller, a little healthier,

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
has a slightly lower voice, or not very much.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Such a person moves in this direction.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
And it is this person, according to such a person, will be listened to.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
Such a person will have the opportunity to convince his target audience in something

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
and, in the end, to lead it after him.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
This is the place of the leader.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
Thus, we have a clear behavioral recipe

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
for turning yourself into a leader in some community.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
First, when you start communicating,

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
if we take the ideal case, the audience is not familiar to you.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
As soon as the communication begins, you are in the position of a stranger.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
The audience does not know you.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
The first task is to stop being a stranger,

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
and to enter the inner zone of this circle.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
The antonym for the word stranger is your own.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
The first thing you need to show people is that you are your own.

44:17.000 --> 44:25.000
And the second consequence is that you are not quite your own,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
that is, you are in the zone of brothers,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
but you are still in the external zone to them,

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
and you are not in the negative zone, but in the positive one.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
That is, according to a number of signs, you are the best.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
A simple recipe for charismatic happiness.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
We need to determine how we need to become our own,

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
and how we need to become better.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
The algorithm is simple.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
First, you need to solve the first task of becoming your own,

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
then work on being in the best direction.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
No other way.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
In order to become your own or to become better,

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
we need to choose a certain parameter that we will adapt to.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
Of course, the parameters can be quite arbitrary,

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
but there is a fairly simple rule by which you need to select these parameters.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
If you want to become better in front of your target audience,

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
then you need to rely on the qualities significant for this audience.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
If you rely on the knowledge of filmography by Fellini

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
in the Society of Biological Professors,

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
you are unlikely to have the opportunity to have a strong impact on this audience.

45:41.000 --> 45:46.000
However, if you say that you studied biology,

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
have a degree in it, a number of scientific works,

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
that the best laboratory in the world is under your leadership,

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
then they will probably start to listen to what you say.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
So, in order to stand out in the best direction,

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
we will have to use the parameters that are most significant for this target audience.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
Automatically, this means that we cannot use these parameters,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
well, we can, of course, but it is undesirable,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
to use them in order to become our own.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
That is, the rule sounds very simple.

46:24.000 --> 46:32.000
To become your own, you need to become the best in the most significant parameters for this target audience.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
How can this be done?

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
Let's take any target audience.

46:38.000 --> 46:47.000
For example, in my opinion, we looked at how to stand out in the audience of children from kindergarten.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
The first thing you need to do is to become your own.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
To become your own in this audience may seem quite difficult.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
You are adults, they are children, they think about toys,

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
you think about serious adult things.

47:05.000 --> 47:11.000
Their whole world is focused on their peers,

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
and on dad and mom, and your whole world is focused on your own families.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
How to become your own?

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
We choose any parameter that is not very significant.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
For example, clothes, external objects, external interests.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
For example, children will perceive clothes much better

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
than a person who comes to them in shorts and a light T-shirt,

47:39.000 --> 47:44.000
than a person who comes to them in clean shoes,

47:44.000 --> 47:52.000
in an expensive suit, in a smooth shirt with shiny big zippers,

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
and tries to get in touch with them.

47:55.000 --> 48:01.000
That is, loose, wrinkled clothes are a minor parameter.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
Wrinkled clothes allow you to get closer to the audience and become your own.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
If you take a toy in your hand,

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
if you smile as openly as they do,

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
if your hairstyle has a certain disorder,

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
which is typical for this target audience,

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
then children will perceive you much better.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
However, if you talk to them from top to bottom,

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
if you speak with a low voice,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
if you emphasize your significance,

48:46.000 --> 48:53.000
you will create a very large social distance between yourself and this target audience.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
You should not be so serious and so threatening to them,

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
otherwise you will become a stranger to them, just an external threat.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
Accordingly, you will not be able to influence this audience,

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
because all their thoughts will be focused on how to get into a long-range from you.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
The ideal option to remove anxiety in this regard is to sit down,

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
to get on the same level with them.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
Thus, children will perceive you as their own.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
So, you should wear loose clothes,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
have a messy hairstyle,

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
and have the same horizontal level of eyes as your children.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
Thus, you have become your own,

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
you have been perceived as you are.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
Further, of course, in this target audience,

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
it is much easier to emphasize that you are better,

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
and you do not have to do anything for it.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
Because it is obvious that you are bigger for them,

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
that you know more, have more experience.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
It is obvious that you are physically stronger.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
Any adult figure is very important for children.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Therefore, in this case,

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
one thing that you have become your own,

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
already allows you to become a leader automatically,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
because the other signs work automatically.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Let's take another target audience.

50:19.000 --> 50:25.000
Let's take, for example, the target audience of a military school cadet.

50:25.000 --> 50:31.000
Let's imagine that you are a programmer

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
who has successfully retired from the army,

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
who has a fairly subtle physique,

50:37.000 --> 50:43.000
knows the languages ​​of Pascal, C++ and Java very well.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
How can such a person become his own

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
with the cadets of the military-maritime school?

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Healthy, strong guys,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
accustomed to hard discipline,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
to the schedule of the day,

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
accustomed to listening to the bosses with powerful, powerful voices.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
How can you become your own

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
with such a target audience?

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
But probably it is not worth saying that you have never been to the sea.

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
Probably it is not worth saying that you are pulling up twice as hard as if you were jumping.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
And probably it is not worth boasting about the deep knowledge of programming languages.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
What is worth boasting about in this case?

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
In this case, you can say that you are just as young as they are,

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
that you are worried about the same problems as they are.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
These are problems, for example, of the opposite sex.

51:47.000 --> 51:54.000
Further, you can say that you have an older brother who also graduated from the maritime school.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Well, probably some of your relatives served.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
Just mentioning that you have some of your relatives who served in the armed forces

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
already makes you much closer to these people.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
This signals to them that you understand them.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
You know what it is.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
This way you can become your own.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
How to become better?

52:14.000 --> 52:21.000
What is the most important thing for young healthy cadets?

52:21.000 --> 52:27.000
Well, probably they are very concerned about the problem of how to charm a girl.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
If you say that you know a few good recipes,

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
you will immediately concentrate their attention on you

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
and get the opportunity to tell them what you want.

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
There are a lot of other ways to stand out in the best direction.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
For example, since you are a smart, competent person,

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
you can say that you read maps well,

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
that you know how to navigate well,

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
that you can tell them about the Google Earth service.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
If you are not familiar with it, they will listen to you with their mouths open.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
The presence of professional knowledge is, as we remember,

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
one of the powerful pieces of charismatic factors.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
The second factor is communication.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
In this case, if you show them that you can easily communicate,

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
answer their questions flexibly,

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
you will also increase your ability to influence these people.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
And the third behavioral factor.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
If you know how to behave with the audience,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
how to treat them,

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
what models to imagine,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
what behavior models to follow,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
then people will also penetrate you with deep respect.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
And you will be able to manage them based on positive social motivation.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
If we are talking about ways to influence the audience,

54:09.000 --> 54:14.000
we should not separate these methods into two large groups.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
The first group will be those tools that influence quickly,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
almost instantly.

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
The second group will be those tools that interact for a long time,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
although not so intensively.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
So, quick resources.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Quick charismatic resources.

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
This group of resources includes what people can perceive immediately.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Quick resources.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
What can a person assess immediately?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
He can assess external data.

54:47.000 --> 54:54.000
Accordingly, it is much easier to get a quick influence on other people,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
people of high height,

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
who look healthy, strong,

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
who have a low, rich timbre of voice.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
What other factors can be attributed to the quick?

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
All the factors that say that a person is smart,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
has a great insight.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
What can be attributed to this?

55:19.000 --> 55:24.000
First, a good insight is a connection with a foreign country.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Any kind of connection.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
It can be reading,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
or simply knowledge of foreign languages.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
It can be the fact that a person has often traveled abroad,

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
or often travels, visited many countries.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
The fact that a person has foreign friends.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
The fact that he reads foreign literature.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
By the way, in the professional circle,

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
knowledge of professional literature in other languages

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
is a very strong charismatic factor.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
Because most of the audience, the target audience,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
is cut off from this information.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
A person becomes a unique carrier of this information.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Just a foreign surname.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
The presence of a foreign spouse.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Foreign citizenship.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
All these are factors that say that, probably,

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
this person has a great insight.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
And the insight and extensive knowledge

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
can be a consequence of the presence of education.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
The more educated a person is,

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
the more likely we are at the level of instant effect,

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
and the more likely we think that he knows a lot,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
and he can do a lot.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
That is, the presence of two higher educations

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
is a stronger charismatic factor than the presence of one.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
The presence of a degree of excellence is much better than the absence of it.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
Especially if it is a specialized one.

56:57.000 --> 57:03.000
Various diplomas, certificates, courses, conferences.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
Professional recognition.

57:07.000 --> 57:13.000
That is, any victory or participation in any professional competition

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
is also a powerful charismatic, fast factor.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
It is this stereotype that exploits the huge number of various professional awards

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
that have recently appeared.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
I'm not talking about the award for cinema, art, journalism.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
There are a lot of awards in business, in various specialties.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
Almost every professional community holds certain competitions.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
Thus, highlighting the most important people.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
The presence of such a certificate on the wall,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
if it is paid attention to,

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
will always increase the charismatic power of its owner.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
That is why, by the way,

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
in the vast majority of organizations,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
the parliamentary conference room,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
where the most important guests are brought,

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
is lined with various cups, certificates, diplomas, certificates.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
In order to emphasize that in this organization

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
people who work there have a wider outlook than in the average room.

58:19.000 --> 58:28.000
So, appearance, low voice, connection with abroad, education.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
These are the factors that allow you to quickly gain influence.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
A very good tool is also getting to know important people.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
That is, a certain reflected charisma.

58:40.000 --> 58:45.000
If a person is familiar with showmen, with influential politicians,

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
in principle, with any person who is more or less famous and is popular,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
this will naturally add charisma to him.

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
In the same list, acquaintance with well-known entrepreneurs

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
or with unknown but rich entrepreneurs.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
Although the acquaintance can be very capricious.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
These are all fast resources.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
Fast resources are characterized by the fact that they work instantly,

59:14.000 --> 59:20.000
but, unfortunately or fortunately, their action ends quite quickly.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
As soon as people begin to communicate more closely with each other,

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
interact on business,

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
that is, it is important for us that this interaction is intense and on business,

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
then fast factors immediately begin to lose their strength.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
It is no longer so important whether a person is tall or short,

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
whether he has a low voice or a high one,

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
whether he has awards and prizes or not.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
Whether he has been abroad 10 times in the last year or only once in Egypt.

59:50.000 --> 59:56.000
This is no longer important, because the qualities that allow him

59:56.000 --> 01:00:04.000
or do not allow him to carry out the functions that we expect from the leader come to the fore.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Let me remind you, these are the four main functions.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Protect, extract, judge, distribute and direct.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
All the factors that we listed in the fast zone,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
they are also such only because they allow us to assume

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000
that their carrier will perform these four functions better than anyone else.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
When we begin to interact with a person,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
we begin to understand how much in reality he is able to perform these functions,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
how much he is really able to protect us,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
how much he is really able to provide us with resources,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
how much he is really and correctly able to choose the direction where we should go,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
what to strive for, and how fairly he is able to judge and award.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
If a person with these functions does not cope well,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:12.000
then gradually the target audience will refuse this person the right to manage himself at the social level.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Of course, he will have such tools as coercion,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
but he will have such a tool as material influence.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
He can fine, issue bonuses, set sales interest,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:37.000
he can deprive of vacation or, on the contrary, award bonus.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
No one can cancel such tools.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
But the ability to simply say,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
guys, let's do it so that people really get up and do it,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
such a person will no longer exist.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Accordingly, we refer to the long-term factors,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:00.000
we refer to the factors that allow in the long term to constantly, every day,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
to carry out the four main functions of the leader,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
to protect, to extract, to direct and to distribute.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
What is needed for this?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
It is quite obvious.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
First of all, of course, professional competence is needed for this.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Moreover, if we talk about top managers,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
then this competence is not in the specialty.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Here, a top manager may not be a professional.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
He must have an idea, but no more,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
so as not to interfere with the specialists doing their job.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And he must be a professional as a manager.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
He must understand how social systems function,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
what groups are,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
what stages of their dynamics they go through

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
before turning into a really effective unit.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000
How to turn a working group into a team?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
How?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
He will need a lot of knowledge of psychology

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
to understand what is happening between people

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
and what exactly needs to be influenced

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
to avoid conflicts and to get an effective job.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Of course, such a factor as the ability to communicate,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
the ability to communicate is necessary for such a leader on a permanent basis.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Because he will need to constantly have the ability to express his thoughts,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
to be able to organize discussions correctly,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
to moderate this discussion properly.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
All this requires a good communication skill.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
As a result, it is worth noting that working on your communication,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
on your ability to communicate well,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
is a very important tool,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
because it works as a fast tool and as a long-term tool.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And the third thing is that this person should really behave like a leader,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
to follow certain behavioral orders,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
which will be associated with the image of a charismatic leader,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
with the image of a father, and will not contradict him.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Well, today we have already talked a lot about

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
what is important to do as a leader.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Some behavioral rules need to be followed.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's time to analyze this issue a little more in detail.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So, what is the basis for the ability of a leader to manage his target audience?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It is based on the fact that people who follow this leader trust him.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
The first and most important quality in the relationship system

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
that arises between the leader and his accomplices is trust.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Accomplices must trust their leader,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
and the leader must trust his accomplices.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Only then will the first ones listen to their leader without any doubts,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
and only then will the leader be able to really rely on them,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
to count on them doing what he wants from them.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So, the most important category that should exist

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
in the relationship between the leader and his accomplices is trust.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Therefore, the behavior that the leader should adhere to

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
should not contradict, but at most strengthen this quality.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
That is, he should behave in such a way

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
that the degree of trust in him increases.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
A fairly simple rule follows from here.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Rule number one.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
The leader must be an absolutely obligatory person.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
He said, he did.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
That is, he must, firstly, be able to make promises,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
take responsibility for them, and, secondly,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
if he has already taken the lead, then he does not say that he is not going.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
He said, he did.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Of course, it is impossible to always keep all your promises.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
In such cases, the leader must, again,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
not let people be in the unknown.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
At the moment when it becomes clear that it is impossible to keep promises,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
the leader must approach his people absolutely honestly and openly

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and tell them that this promise will not be fulfilled,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
but, for example, some other promise will be fulfilled.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Thus, we come to the next category, the category of openness.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Of course, openness can only be allowed by a really strong leader.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Why?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Because when the leader opens up completely,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
he thus makes himself more predictable,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
more understandable for his target audience,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
so that what happens with social distance?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It decreases.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
That is, if the reformation is not very strong in terms of significant factors,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
then such a leader risks to fall into the trap.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Therefore, with openness, the leader must be very careful,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
not to overdo it.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It is necessary to clearly understand how strong the advantage is in front of the target audience.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And, by the way, for those leaders who have very strong significant signs,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
so much so that they risk that the separation,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
even in the positive direction of increasing social distance,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
can throw them into the zone of strangers,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I advise such leaders, on the contrary, to show as much openness as possible,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000
maybe even to engage in personal interaction with their subordinates.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
To drink beer in the evening,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
just to talk about the soul,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
to ask about the soul once again,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
to ask like a family,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
that is, to create additional approximating factors,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
so as not to fly out of the zone of a stranger.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
That is, openness is a tool

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
with which you can additionally adjust the social distance

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
between the leader and his target audience.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But obligation is a tough and absolute requirement.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
If every fulfilled promise adds trust,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
every unfulfilled promise is five times stronger,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
it kills trust.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It is enough to do it only a few times.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
No matter how high the level of trust in the leader is,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
it is enough to fail to fulfill your promises several times in a row,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and the ability to influence people through positive social motivation disappears.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
The leader cannot afford to be unnecessary.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
That is why, for example, when I am called a charismatic leader of showmen,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I am slightly disturbed.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Because publicity, fame, of course, is a good significant factor.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Publicly famous people, of course, have a wide circle of acquaintances.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
They are popular, they have a wide access to information.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
But it is not a fact that they use this information properly.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It is not a fact that they really understand how to do one thing or another.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And it is absolutely not a fact that they know how to keep their word.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And by the way, if we are talking about political leaders,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
there is nothing worse for a political career of a leader

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
than to give a public promise, a tough and clear one,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
the kind of promise that should be, and then not to keep it.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
That is why, by the way, most of the current politicians avoid giving any clear promises.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
The promises they make, the promises they call such, have a vague common character.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
As a result, it is impossible to understand whether such a promise is kept or not.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
As a result, they do not risk losing trust.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But they also cannot gain trust in this way.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
A person who can really give tough, clear promises and keep them for a long time,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000
instantly, with each next promise, the more significant it is,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
the more power and ability to manage the people to whom he gave this promise.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Or who know that he made such a promise.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000
In business, for example, the reputation that my company has,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:56.000
is largely based on the fact that, for example, we are always tough and clear in financial affairs.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
If we have agreed with our partners that we will pay the agreed terms and conditions,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
we will do exactly that.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Because we have a clear and tough rule.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Either we do not agree, or we agree in such a way that we really keep our word.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Moreover, it does not depend on how our partners behave.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
They can violate their commitments, but we will fulfill our commitments in any case.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Because it is important not only in relation to these specific agents, as we have behaved,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
but for all other people in the market, for all other business community,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
it is extremely important to have information that, for example,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Cameo keeps its word and always fulfills its financial obligations.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
This increases the degree of trust.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
As a result, we can communicate with these people and agree on something,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and influence their commercial policies.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
And plus, this reduces their financial risks,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and allows us to get better conditions,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
because partners do not need to take risks.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So, I will repeat again, because this is extremely important for any charismatic leader of the rule.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
The first rule is commitment.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
You need to be able to give clear promises,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
which have certain deadlines, certain numerical parameters of execution,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
so that you can clearly say whether you did it or not.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And then keep your word, fulfill your obligations on time.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
The second behavioral rule, which is only two,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
everything else is a consequence of the first two.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The second rule I call anti-victim.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So, the second behavioral rule is anti-victim.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
By this word, I mean a certain combination of behavioral techniques,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
behavioral rules, combined with one common thought.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
This is the thought of how not to behave.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Of course, this typology is somewhat conditional.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
On the other hand, this is a very good practical tool.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000
It allows you to easily understand at any time whether you are behaving as a leader should or not.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So, if you are able to assess your own behavior,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
listen to yourself, see the reflection of your behavior in the eyes of others,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
you will be able to constantly correct your behavior in the right direction every minute.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
As a result, the level of trust in you from your target audience,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
your people will increase, and the ability to manage them will also increase.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
So, anti-victim.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000
From the title, it is clear that a leader should behave in the opposite way than a victim.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Let's see how animals or people who become victims behave.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
What do they do?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Well, the first thing is that we talked a lot about the voice today.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
A high, piercing voice is a sign of a victim.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
A weak, saturated tone of this voice.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
A bad tone. A weak tone.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
How does a victim behave?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
A classic victim behavior.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
The victim is afraid.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
The victim runs away.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
The victim hides.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000
If we talk about behavior while communicating, then the victim is in a hurry.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
If we speak from the point of view of the appearance, physiology,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
then the victim tries to hide, protect the vulnerable parts of his own body.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.000
There is a simple rule that tells you how a person is arranged from the point of view of attack and defense.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Everything that is outside the person, the back, the outer surface of the arms, the outer surface of the hips,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
these are all protective shells.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
They are characterized by the fact that there is a small amount of veins, arteries.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.000
There are hard muscles, large muscles that can withstand a strong load, strong damage.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:17.000
The bones that protrude from the outside are able to take outlines without corners,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
which are able to fit into any hard surface.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000
If you do a handstand, you will easily understand what the protective outer contours are.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Everything that is inside is the most vulnerable parts of the human body.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
This is the inner surface of the neck.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
This is the inner surface of the hands.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Look at your hands from the inside.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
You see veins.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
They come right to the surface.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Turn your hand over, you will see that there are no veins at all.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:03.000
The stomach, the inner surface of the hips, the most powerful arteries and veins pass through the inner surface of the neck,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
this is the sleeping artery, and through the inner surface of the hips.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
If a person is cut one of these veins, then he practically, without special assistance,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
practically 100% dies from blood loss.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Therefore, these are the most vulnerable parts of the human body.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
The leader trusts the world around him.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The leader trusts his accomplices.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Therefore, he does not need to hide those parts of his body that are the most vulnerable.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
He is sure that he can withstand external threats.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
He is calm and confident.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
As a result, these parts of his body are open.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
He is able to make open gestures.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
He does not clamp his neck.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
He is able to put his leg outward.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
The victim behaves in a completely different way.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
The classic sign of a victim is a head pulled into his shoulders.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Like this.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Walk down the street today or tomorrow and see how people around you walk.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
At least half of the people will have a muscle clamp in the neck area.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
They try to instinctively cover their neck from external threats.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And when we see this, we instinctively refuse these people the ability to control themselves,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
the ability to be charismatic leaders.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Because they directly demonstrate their fear to us.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
This does not mean that a charismatic leader is not afraid.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But a charismatic leader trusts his own strength more,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
trusts his own accomplices more than he is afraid of.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And that's why he is able to be open.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Not clamped.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
So, neck clamp.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
A classic sign.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.000
A humped back is also a way to hide internal organs from external threats.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
A clamped back.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Tightly compressed legs.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Look at how in all public speaking courses they advise to spread your legs a little.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Not very wide, because it is not functional and a person is not able to move effectively from this position.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
But at the level of the shoulders.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
As a result, the legs are open.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
In principle, the position is quite open.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
And they advise to spread your legs a little.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
That is, opening the legs.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Making an open gesture.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
A direct opposite is a closed gesture, a closed position.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
A person standing in this position will never be able to lead anyone in his life.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
He can still convince, but he will never be able to lead.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
The audience will not trust such a person.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And the last rule that I wanted to bring from the assortment of anti-victims.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
It is clear that there are a lot of them.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And you can always understand how you behave as a victim or not as a victim.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
But I would like to draw your attention to one more important rule.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.000
What does a puppy do when a big healthy dog approaches him?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The puppy falls on his back.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Opens the belly, demonstrating the vulnerability itself, so that he is not touched.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And let the jet.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
In this case, we are only concerned about the first reaction.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
The puppy goes down.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000
No matter how healthy he is and no matter how small the adult dog is.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:48.000
The puppy, refusing to enter into rivalry or equal communication with this individual, goes down.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So, the victim is the one who is at the bottom.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:02.000
This is one of the reasons why high growth allows you to be more significant.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
The effect is that the one at the bottom is in a more vulnerable position.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It is much easier to attack from above.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
The force of gravity itself helps to cause damage from top to bottom.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Thus, the one who is at the bottom takes the position of the victim.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
The one who goes down.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:31.000
He says that I am at the bottom, I am obviously weaker than you, do not offend me.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And can even open his belly.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Thus, look carefully at how you communicate.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
This is especially important in communication with significant people.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You always want to sit down a little in their presence.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Bow your head to the side.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
To portray a look from bottom to top.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
All this is a recognition of yourself.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
The attitude of yourself is lower to this person than he is.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
If you are a leader, if you are a boss.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Then your advantage over your subordinates is very small.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:20.000
It can be a drop that will weigh over and as a result will lower your charismatic advantage.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
If you start looking from bottom to top at your subordinates.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
They will stop perceiving you as a leader.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
In this case, it is important to be a little higher.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.000
On the other hand, it is very important not to abuse these rules.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:45.000
The classic boss's table looks like a very high chair.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
A very high chair, a high chair.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And there, it means, the boss is sitting down.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The subordinate is forced to sit down somewhere at the bottom.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
On the table, whose surface is much lower.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And as a result, it will be much lower.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
The classic table for bureaucratic meetings looks like this.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:15.000
A high table for the boss and a table for all other managers who will meet with him with a strong enough reduction.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Thus, the role of the leader is emphasized, it is strengthened.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
It worked well before.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Because, by and large, there was no need for significant differences between top managers and managers.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Everyone just played his role in the bureaucratic apparatus.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
By and large, they were absolutely equal.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And this technique was needed specifically to raise the leaders above the rest.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
So that they do not get confused and remember who their leader is.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Now, when the world is changing very quickly, when the level of competition has increased sharply,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
it is extremely important to really have professional qualities.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Therefore, the leader, if he is a really significant leader,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
absolutely does not need to raise his table or chair even higher.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
If he does so, it signals the opposite.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Now it will signal to his managers that he is afraid to compete with them,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
he is afraid to take the same level as them.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
As a result, they will begin to experience...

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So, the modern rule says very simply.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.000
You can't be under, you can't hang from above.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000
When we hang from above, we do not suppress the intellect, but we suppress our physical superiority.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Of course, if your desire is to suppress the opponent, then this is absolutely natural.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
But if you want to use positive social motivation,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
if you want to entice a person and lead him after you,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
then you should never press him from above.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
You can be at an easy elevation if you speak in front of a large audience.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
It is big, but you are a little higher.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
This is to balance each other.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
But if you speak with a person and he is below you,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and you look at him from top to bottom,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
you are additionally humiliating him and attacking him.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And he will naturally move away from you and defend himself.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It will be harder for you to convince him, it will be harder for you to lead him after you.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So, rule number two. Anti-victim.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Whatever you do, it always makes sense to think whether you are acting as a victim or not.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Are you acting in the opposite way to the victim?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
This is a very good metaphor, it allows you to always understand at any time whether you are acting right.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:56.000
So, there are only two behavioral rules that you need to remember to become effective charismatic leaders.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
The first one is a commitment, the second one is an anti-victim.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:17.000
So, in today's course we have discussed what charisma is and how to develop it.
