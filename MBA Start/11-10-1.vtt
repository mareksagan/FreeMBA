00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hello, colleagues. I am Vladimir Kevorkov.

00:03.000 --> 00:20.000
In 1980, at the Podmoskovnoye defense enterprise, I was creating and, until 1993, I was in charge of such departments as the Advertising Bureau and the Research and Demand, and since 1990, I have been the head of the Marketing Department.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
I have been engaged in advertising and promotion of the company for 27 years.

00:28.000 --> 00:40.000
In the late 1980s, I was a member of the Administration of the Association of Advertising Workers of the USSR, and in the mid-1990s, I worked as the creative director of several advertising agencies.

00:40.000 --> 01:03.000
In today's course, we will discuss the main aspects of the brand and its role in improving the competitiveness of the company, the psychology of advertising and its basic concepts, the approach to the foundation of the brand,

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
that is, is the brand a trademark or a motivating idea?

01:09.000 --> 01:27.000
Let's see and discuss how the brand's contribution to the improvement of the company's competitiveness is assessed and how to assess the approaches to its promotion that could be used in our specific activities.

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
What does the brand really give us? What does it give us as a company and why is so much attention paid to this term today?

01:37.000 --> 01:51.000
Let's start with some basic positions related to advertising as a carrying element of the marketing concept.

01:51.000 --> 02:03.000
Advertising is what we live with every day. Almost everyone considers themselves an expert in advertising.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
I will not dwell on the definition of classical advertising, there are quite a few of them.

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
I personally like this, you know, maybe a little bit untraditional, to quote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

02:18.000 --> 02:29.000
He once said that with normal pedagogy there is a continuous pedagogical influence of extraordinary force, which is called advertising.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
I would like you to pay attention to this word, the influence of extraordinary force.

02:36.000 --> 02:52.000
This constant influence on our subconscious, sometimes even with the use of not very correct methods, pushes us to a specific action.

02:52.000 --> 03:07.000
But in general, if we talk about a kind of de-formalization of the definition of advertising, then I personally liked the definition that I saw at the Belarusian Agency for Trade Advertising in the early 80s.

03:07.000 --> 03:20.000
You know, at that time, even the accounts were not so common, and what we consider the norm of the design of any street, city, room, etc.

03:20.000 --> 03:29.000
At that time, it was quite a big rarity, and at the Belarusian Agency for Trade Advertising there was such a wonderful account.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
It said that advertising is politics, economics and art.

03:35.000 --> 03:47.000
If, colleagues, we will replace the word politics with the word ideology, then you must agree with me that this will be an absolutely accurate definition of advertising.

03:47.000 --> 04:08.000
Advertising is an unconditional ideology, and the fact that we, as companies and organizations, sometimes do not pay attention to this, we put ourselves in a situation where we can form certain messages, certain values.

04:09.000 --> 04:28.000
As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said, with such a massive impact on the use of colossal media, we can ultimately form something that will be partly unnatural to our culture, to our mentality, and we are already facing this.

04:28.000 --> 04:38.000
Of course, advertising is, of course, economics, and therefore it would be completely unreasonable to say that advertising is akin to some kind of altruism.

04:38.000 --> 04:55.000
God forbid, I invest money in the promotion of a product in the hope that the money I spent to interest you, to convince you to go and buy this product, they, as it were, eventually led to this action.

04:55.000 --> 05:05.000
And the action here is one thing, go and buy this particular product and get this particular benefit, that is, to solve some specific need of yours.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
The fact that advertising is art.

05:08.000 --> 05:20.000
You know, many people don't like some kind of advertising solutions, someone is bothered by some approaches, someone doesn't like the audience, sound, and so on.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
You see, the creativity and the overall assessment of advertising campaigns is initially subjective.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
And probably it's impossible to achieve that your advertising is liked by absolutely everyone.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
We always forget our culture, our mentality, and the proverbs and phrases we grew up with.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Remember this wonderful proverb, you won't be nice to everyone.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Advertising cannot be liked by absolutely everyone.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
And you see, in the assessment of advertising, the main thing is not to be liked, not to be liked.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
And the main criteria for whether it is good or bad is whether it promotes a specific action or not.

06:00.000 --> 06:13.000
That is, whether it went after a person saw this informational message, read it, whether it prompted him to go and perform this specific action.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
It's just come and buy.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
That is, therefore, of course, its assessment of the creation of this text is initially creative.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Because it is initially art, because you have to find, find.

06:30.000 --> 06:38.000
Maybe not necessarily, as it were, sometimes it can be two or three phrases that in the form of a motto that promotes action.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Sometimes it can be some kind of philosophy that exposes a certain position.

06:43.000 --> 06:53.000
But still, any creation of any text, the creation of any picture, it initially has an element, let's say, an element of art as such.

06:53.000 --> 07:03.000
I just wanted to give you an example of such a seemingly completely unsubdued way of attracting attention to a particular store.

07:03.000 --> 07:14.000
In the early 2000s, my colleagues and I were walking around St. Petersburg and suddenly on one of the streets we suddenly, quite accidentally,

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
well, we had such a, let's say, a housing problem, something like that, to buy water, cigarettes and so on.

07:19.000 --> 07:31.000
And suddenly, at one of the semi-basement St. Petersburg grocery stores, my friend pays attention to a completely unexpected advertising ad from the point of view of approach.

07:31.000 --> 07:39.000
On the ad, yes, on a piece of cotton, beautifully, in good, yes, such readable font, it was written,

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
the store is urgently required, and in huge letters it was written, buyers.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
And there was a big exclamation mark.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
From this unexpected move, from this non-standard approach, we naturally, as it were, so here we stood, stopped, looked, and the colleague says,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
what an interesting ad, let's go and see.

08:00.000 --> 08:12.000
When we went into the store, we were convinced that the store itself was completely banal and, in general, there was nothing, how to say, nothing so original, nothing, so to speak, out of the ordinary.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, we also had a problem, not some kind of going beyond the bounds, some kind of isis, some kind of exclusive, and so on.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
We naturally, as it were, realized our problem.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
But I give this example, I give you for what?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Look, isn't this an element of art?

08:29.000 --> 08:38.000
As colleagues from the store, without making some neon advertising ad, without making some, I don't know, so to speak, intricate shields, and so on,

08:38.000 --> 08:51.000
very simply, with the simplest means, they moved us to go to this store and, accordingly, as it were, already looked at how much we can solve this or that problem.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
Many say that you have noticed that the store is kind of ordinary, and perhaps the second time you will not go.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
But, colleagues, let's sort of split two things with you.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
The task of advertising as such is to attract attention, to move you to a specific action.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
But the second part, whether I will come here or not, here, of course, the role of advertising matters, but it is already less.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
Here, as it were, the whole marketing complex as such already matters.

09:20.000 --> 09:28.000
Therefore, when we discuss issues related to the assessment of the effectiveness of the campaigns carried out,

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
I would like to warn you from the very beginning that we will consider the assessment of efficiency as a complex action, and not just a fact.

09:36.000 --> 09:48.000
After all, you understand, wonderful advertising, very bright, very motivating, causing a desire to go, to be interested, to clarify, and perhaps even to buy or use this service.

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
You come or you call the company, and suddenly you get into a situation that, in Russian, is called very simple, did not wait.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
And, accordingly, the whole reaction and your actions will be completely different.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And is it the fault of advertising?

10:05.000 --> 10:17.000
It is no coincidence that today many experts in the field of professional marketing and management pay attention to the staff and top management

10:17.000 --> 10:33.000
so that advertising and marketing take on as much responsibility for generously given promises as the staff wants and can convey to the consumer.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Pay special attention to the word wants.

10:37.000 --> 10:45.000
Initially, it should want so that there is no gap, what we have in everyday practice.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
What we sometimes meet in the promotion of brands.

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
That is, the brand's promise and the reaction of the staff when I, after I was imbued with these promises,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
how I felt a desire to use it, and so on.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
And with what I have encountered, they do not correlate.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
This is very, very dangerous.

11:06.000 --> 11:16.000
But in any case, I repeat again, in any case, advertising is art from the point of view of any creation of text, any thing,

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
it initially has an element, to a greater or lesser extent, of art.

11:23.000 --> 11:31.000
Of course, there are advertising works that in general, from the point of view of artistic decision,

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
they certainly cause respect for the staging, the frames and colors.

11:36.000 --> 11:44.000
But again, I pay attention to the main criterion of advertising, not its assessment by high professionals,

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
how the color is chosen, how the actor is chosen successfully, how the logo is placed successfully, and so on.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
And what is the result? Did it work out or not? Did the buyer go for this product or not?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
After all, its basis is the economy.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
Of course, colleagues, of course, any promotion, any promotion of a brand, so to speak, a brand, a product, and so on,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
it is communication.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
And, accordingly, we should pay the most attention to this.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
And what is communication? It is information, a reminder of what we are promoting,

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
and a certain promotion, a consumer's conviction that what we have offered him today,

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
what we have told him today, is exactly what he really needs.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
It is quite obvious that people will not buy a product until they learn about its existence,

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
will not understand what it may be useful for, will not realize what benefit it will bring,

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
and most importantly, will not understand where it can be bought.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
After all, you and I sometimes come across this, yes, when, well, there is such a concept,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
introducing and exaggerating advertising, when you inform about a new product,

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
I seem to have already penetrated the fact that this is necessary, I start looking and I can't find it.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Well, if in this case, on the market, the product that you have advertised so well and brightly,

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
there are no competitors, and if there are, I kind of realized, you formed for me,

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
maybe even, how to say, sharpened my attention to a certain need in what I need.

13:20.000 --> 13:28.000
I did not find that product, that service that you offered, but having already realized a certain need in something,

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
I go to the market and start analyzing what is the offer on this topic.

13:33.000 --> 13:39.000
And if I find some analogues, then I certainly, yes, well, I can, rather, yes,

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
focus not on you, but on the competitor who offers a similar product or a similar service.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
People will certainly never spend their money, their time,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
on the search for a given product or service, if they do not have a specific motive,

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
and there will be no, as it were, yes, conviction that it is this product, it is this service,

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
it is what they just need today, or tomorrow, or in the foreseeable future.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
Therefore, it is not by chance that today so much attention is paid to promotion,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
yes, it is in promotion that the concept of consumer value is given.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
That is, in advertising, you, and in promotion, you, first of all, well, how to say,

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
try to explain to me, show me, yes, that what I will take is valuable for me personally.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
Here, probably, one of the most difficult problems for all of us, and the problem of promotion of the brand,

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
and the increase in loyalty of consumers, yes, it consists in the fact that we cannot understand

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
that since people are different as such, since they are different in mentality,

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
in their psychodemographic characteristics, in their psychotype, and so on,

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
then, probably, both goods and services cannot be the same for them.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
There is such a, you know, a professional myth, it is called a myth about standard goods.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
That is, well, colleagues, in order not to bother themselves too much, say, well, what can be said about?

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
Well, for example, let's say, such a banal product as soap, toothpaste, and so on.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
Well, it seems like, well, toothpaste that helps to brush your teeth, well, soap that, yes, washes, and so on.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, what can be unique there?

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
That is, well, plus or minus, yes, say, well, let's say, by category, there is a price, there is more of this, more of this.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
But within the scope of further, here, more deep detailing and segmentation, where is uniqueness there?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
And this concept is introduced, a myth about standard goods, and, as they say,

15:39.000 --> 15:47.000
that if the product is standard, then its advertising should be, as it were, standard, and its promotion will be standard.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
But I once again draw your attention, we are not standard, and we are not alike.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
Therefore, and advertising for each of us, it should have some element of personalization.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
The same applies to the promotion of the brand.

16:02.000 --> 16:10.000
A brand, let's say, any well-known brand, it certainly has some specific postulate, yes, such characteristics, and so on.

16:10.000 --> 16:24.000
But nevertheless, for each category, for a group of consumers, we are trying to find a certain bridge to explain to this particular consumer that this is his brand, this is part of his essence.

16:25.000 --> 16:32.000
And it is quite obvious that in the process of communication, a very important point, a very important point is a reminder.

16:32.000 --> 16:42.000
If earlier, well, let's say, under the Soviet government, there, yes, even before the perestroika, the slogan was very popular, yes, advertising is the engine of trade,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
then today it is simply incorrect to talk about it.

16:46.000 --> 17:03.000
Advertising can no longer be the engine of trade, not because it is not needed, but because today its entire function, its entire function, how to tell you, is reduced to one thing, only to a reminder and information.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
It guarantees nothing more.

17:06.000 --> 17:26.000
When you have a shortage on the market, when there is no, how to tell you, yes, shortage of goods and so on, then the very fact, yes, information that somewhere there, at some point, something is being sold there, or some kind of product has appeared, has already said that everything, people, as it were, went, people bought, they have already seen, and so on.

17:26.000 --> 17:49.000
Today, when there are more than one analogues, when competitors are trying to convince your potential consumer that it is his product, it is with his characteristics, it is exactly what to a greater extent, well, as it were, corresponds to the understanding of the consumer value of a particular consumer, it no longer guarantees, as it were, a purchase.

17:49.000 --> 17:59.000
But nevertheless, as information, it should be, and by repeating it, and by constantly reminding that I exist, it should be.

17:59.000 --> 18:11.000
It would seem, yes, we all are indignant with you, as it were, yes, here is a certain excessive obsessiveness of advertising. It is a lot on TV, it is a lot on the street, it is a lot in the newspaper, and so on, and so on.

18:11.000 --> 18:24.000
But you must agree, colleagues, that if, look, yes, you started to produce or created something absolutely very valuable for some category of consumers, a service, a product, and so on.

18:24.000 --> 18:43.000
You gave an ad once, it is very valuable, but it has, well, let's say, distinctive, but analogues on the market. You gave an ad once and you think that now everyone is interested and should, as you know, go to you with a river, sign up, buy, and so on.

18:43.000 --> 19:09.000
You do not give more ads, and your competitors, even if they have a product that is somewhat different, maybe even worse than you, but constantly reminding, that is, precisely because they constantly remind about it, can move consumers to go and choose not you, but the one that is, which is, as it were, really presented on the market.

19:10.000 --> 19:28.000
When we talk about consumers, yes, about consumers of our goods, our services, we must at least in a large cell, yes, imagine how we would arrange them with you, precisely from the point of view of the attitude, as it were, to our product.

19:28.000 --> 19:41.000
You know, today a very problematic area of ​​consumer ranking is in understanding what a loyal consumer is and what is a devoted and devoted.

19:42.000 --> 19:54.000
If we take with you the classic formulation of the consumer ranking, the consumer profiles, here they are, as it were, presented on the slide, then you see here, we have here with you four main categories.

19:55.000 --> 20:13.000
Loyal consumers, regular consumers, irregular consumers, well, and non-users, that is, those who, due to some reasons, may be economic, may be psychological, may be a psychotype, and so on, are categorically not and will never be our consumers.

20:14.000 --> 20:25.000
I just wanted to draw your attention to this term, which today causes the greatest, well, not that disputes, but some differences, various interpretations. Loyal consumers.

20:25.000 --> 20:34.000
We have an understanding of a loyal consumer, well, in terminology, there is an idea of ​​a devoted consumer and there is an idea of ​​a devoted consumer.

20:34.000 --> 20:51.000
From the point of view of the promotion of the brand, from the point of view of the promotion of the brand, from the point of view of, how to tell you, yes, it is the increase in competitiveness of companies, for us it is not just loyal consumers that are important, but it is devoted and devoted that are important.

20:51.000 --> 21:05.000
Therefore, I will allow myself to comment on this difference between loyal, devoted and devoted, again, based on the research of foreign experts in the field of marketing and management.

21:05.000 --> 21:23.000
How is it proposed to distinguish these concepts? Loyalty, as such, colleagues, is your, well, how to tell you, positive attitude to something. You like this brand, you like this brand, you like, so to speak, everything that is related to it.

21:23.000 --> 21:35.000
But at the same time, you also speak well and also positively about the brand, the brand of the product that is presented to competitors, and maybe not one, but maybe two and three.

21:35.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, let's say for men this is a completely typical situation with cars of a certain class. They can be loyal to two, three, four brands within a certain category.

21:48.000 --> 21:59.000
For the representation of a beautiful sex, well, the most popular is, let's say, washing powders, the abundance of which is quite large, and they are likely to be loyal to some brands.

22:00.000 --> 22:16.000
But only in the case when you, in the process of action, in the process of buying, choose a specific brand, here you, as it were, from a loyal consumer go to the category of devoted and devoted.

22:16.000 --> 22:39.000
At the same time, Western specialists propose to determine loyalty and devotion in the category of how, if in more than 70, there, 75% of cases, in the process of choosing action, you choose a specific brand or a specific brand, then you have already moved from the category of loyal to the category of devoted and devoted.

22:39.000 --> 22:59.000
And I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that here it is not 100% loyalty, it is already akin to some kind of slavery, hostility, and it would probably be wrong to demand such exclusive loyalty.

22:59.000 --> 23:22.000
Because if we, within the framework of the concept of promoting a brand, will constantly hope and encourage our consumers to fear God, even in some situation when I, let's say, do not have this product or this service, it is better to refuse to solve your problem at all, but in no case to not buy, let's say, not to use the service or the product of a competitor.

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
We can form a certain negative attitude towards the relationship that exists.

23:30.000 --> 23:49.000
Therefore, I absolutely agree with Western specialists who say that if in more than 70% of cases you choose me, then this is already the loyalty that goes into some kind of devotion, into some kind of devotion to my brand, to my brand.

23:49.000 --> 24:07.000
But if we return to the point where the communication between the company and the consumer begins, it will, of course, and how the consumer perceives our message, it will go into the sphere of the psychology of advertising perception.

24:07.000 --> 24:21.000
From the point of view of attracting attention to any informational message, psychologists have established that the first place is traditionally humor and game.

24:21.000 --> 24:33.000
You, colleagues, should agree with this because the game, this game component, is initially embedded in the mentality of our human being.

24:33.000 --> 24:48.000
Look how we succumb to any games, games, and so on, how we get carried away with various games, let's say, SMS games, I'm not talking about the problem that is associated with the gaming business.

24:48.000 --> 25:06.000
This is a game, and it is initially embedded in the perception of a person, and therefore humor, as a kind of game form, that is, a game of words, and so on, and a game, they must be used first of all from the point of attraction.

25:06.000 --> 25:18.000
And you probably see this in the advertising of a number of brands, they use, how to say, in a good sense, both game moments, and some kind of game intrigue, and, of course, humor.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
In the second place, as psychologists have determined, there is neutrality, foundationality, pragmatism.

25:24.000 --> 25:44.000
That is, from the point of view of attracting attention, in the second place there is an understanding of the consumer that this thing, or this service, fully meets the needs that have now been formed by a particular consumer.

25:44.000 --> 25:55.000
And it has a set of consumer values that are very important for this particular consumer.

25:56.000 --> 26:14.000
In the third place, from the point of attraction, there is shock, you know, sometimes a harsh impact that makes you feel excited, makes you even tremble a little from what you saw.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
And in the fourth place there is sex.

26:18.000 --> 26:39.000
That's why I just wanted to draw your attention, colleagues, that unfortunately today we still have, let's say, a large number of examples of the use of this erotic theme, eroticism, erotic sex, eroticism in advertising, which in most cases today is absolutely unjustified.

26:40.000 --> 27:00.000
There are situations where, let's say, the reasonable use of the erotic theme really goes somewhere, let's say, to a certain level of the game, to a certain level of such irony with humor, and it is really, let's say, acceptable and acceptable for a certain category of goods and a certain category of services.

27:01.000 --> 27:16.000
But when we see today, to this day, well, let's say, I would not want to just call it, but in advertising of car manufacturing companies, famous brands, the use of, let's say, an erotic theme in the framework of advertising of engines, engines, and so on.

27:17.000 --> 27:26.000
This is not a coincidence, this is not appropriate, except, how can I say, except for a generally negative attitude to this brand, nothing else causes.

27:26.000 --> 27:45.000
No one denies that this element was, is and, of course, will be used, but its reasonableness, it must be absolutely justified and it must be absolutely tied, at least at the level of the thinking process, to a specific product, to a specific service.

27:45.000 --> 28:00.000
There are quite a lot of psychology of advertising perception and models, you probably have heard and, perhaps, even studied it, this so-called AIDA model or my AIDMA model, yes, attention, interest, motive, action, and so on.

28:00.000 --> 28:13.000
I wanted to offer you a slightly different concept of the psychology of advertising perception, which is also presented on the slide of the psychology of advertising perception, the 4A model.

28:13.000 --> 28:24.000
Why do I like it more? Now I will explain to you, look, yes, here 4A, the first is awareness, the second is attitude, the third is buying, and the fourth is re-buying.

28:25.000 --> 28:39.000
It is precisely because of this last part, because the main task of the psychology of advertising perception is to move to the action of not the first specific purchase, but to the second and so on.

28:39.000 --> 28:58.000
After all, you understand, yes, you can make an amazing advertising ad, you can make a very bright motive, you can make some completely unconventional, non-standard solution in terms of the course of use of funds, and so on, and move me to a specific action, and the action in this case is one, this is a purchase.

28:58.000 --> 29:09.000
What I was actually talking about when we were moved, when we went to the store. But the main thing is not just to come once, but the main thing is that I come again and again.

29:09.000 --> 29:22.000
And so, re-purchasing, as again, advertising as an element of the marketing complex, it is very important here, and I would like you to pay attention to this.

29:22.000 --> 29:36.000
Because the first information component, just information, yes, we have a unique product that is generally responsible for everything that can be done, you have been looking for it for a long time, run urgently, urgently, urgently here, you must have time, and so on.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
It is certainly important, but here, further, everything should be included in the complex.

29:41.000 --> 29:48.000
We have already talked about the fact that there is no standard buyer, and, accordingly, there is no standard product.

29:48.000 --> 30:01.000
As for the classics of marketing, you have probably repeatedly passed through and studied it, and, of course, you know this concept, the concept of segmenting the market, segmenting consumers.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
It is certainly at the heart of the development of any advertising company.

30:07.000 --> 30:29.000
But I would like to draw your attention to the fact that even within a certain segment of consumers, it would seem, yes, we have determined that our consumer is from such a social group, such a family situation, such an age, with such an income, with such habits, and so on.

30:29.000 --> 30:40.000
And if he is, in general, plus or minus similar to everyone else, then let's make a single standard of advertising influence for him.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
I would like to warn you against this.

30:43.000 --> 30:53.000
Even within a specific narrow niche of the consumer, a narrow segment, the impact on this consumer can be completely different.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
That is, they can be, how to tell you, done from different positions.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Well, the first option.

30:59.000 --> 31:05.000
The first option, we can assume that the impact is primary, and it is it that creates the need.

31:05.000 --> 31:19.000
Sometimes today you can still meet such, you know, well, what is the criteria for assessing the effectiveness of work, yes, here is the whole complex of marketing communication, this ability to sell, so to speak, snow, Eskimos in winter.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
Well, this is not, as it were, yes, absolutely the right move, and that's what you need to strive for.

31:25.000 --> 31:43.000
Of course, yes, we have, as it were, and network marketing, which, in general, is built on this, namely, on the drive to that specific action, even sometimes to acquire those goods and services that are not always the first necessity.

31:43.000 --> 31:49.000
And it is this so-called suggestive model, that is, the imperative psychological impact.

31:49.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, to make it clear how advertising is done in this case, let's take such, you know, just, well, how can I tell you, such a general example, an example of promotion of advertising information on a car.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
We will not say what brand of car, here, as it were, it is not at all fundamental.

32:07.000 --> 32:25.000
So, we are considering an example of the presentation of advertising message on a car, I have already said that here it is not fundamental what brand, well, let's say, let's assume that this is some, well, let's say, a good enough, if we say, model of a car, at a price of $ 92,000.

32:25.000 --> 32:36.000
And in the case when we want to have an impact from the point of view of the formation of needs, as in this case, we would have formed an advertising ad.

32:36.000 --> 32:43.000
We could do this, this car is worthy of your attention, you will never regret that you spent money on it.

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
Just imagine how a loved one will thank you for the purchase, make him a gift.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
I would like to draw your attention to this phrase from the very beginning. Do it, hurry, hurry.

32:55.000 --> 33:08.000
Remember how before in the Soviet, not even in the Soviet, but probably at the beginning, so to speak, yes, the Soviet authorities, in the 1920s, such a term was used in advertising as demand in stores, yes.

33:08.000 --> 33:19.000
So here, make him a gift, do not postpone the purchase, again, the verb to action, hurry, the faster it happens, the better for you.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
The price of the car is $ 92,000.

33:23.000 --> 33:31.000
Now, let's assume that we want to go a little different way, again, to the same target audience.

33:31.000 --> 33:42.000
That is, playing on the needs, that is, such a purely classical marketing approach, which says that advertising only addresses the needs.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
As if in this case, we have formulated an advertising message.

33:46.000 --> 33:54.000
This car, well, let's say, a miracle of modern technology, excellent speed, no noise and safety.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
This is what makes it different from its predecessors.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
According to all technical data today, this is perhaps the best car.

34:04.000 --> 34:15.000
Again, I draw your attention to the word perhaps, because as if to say that the best, well, it's like, yes, if not to have certificates, confirmation and so on, it would be, well, of course, a violation of the laws of advertising.

34:15.000 --> 34:22.000
On the trip you will enjoy the unforgettable feelings of comfort and joy from moving to the stop.

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
Today the price is 5% lower than a month ago.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
It is $ 92,000.

34:30.000 --> 34:37.000
That is, here we are playing on the fact that it is, as it were, on those values ​​that we draw the attention of consumers.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
We also play on some kind of pragmatism.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.000
That is, that you, while still realizing your needs, can still win and save.

34:48.000 --> 34:56.000
But there are in the same category of consumers and a third subgroup for which the so-called image component is very important.

34:56.000 --> 35:05.000
Yes, the commitment to a certain clan, the commitment to a certain group of consumers, some kind of self-affirmation.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
How would you, in this case, we should have made an advertising message.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
Well, for example, we choose the name of some famous actor, artist, I don't know, a famous person and say how.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
From his name.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I've been driving this car for six months.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
It is not as tough as some other and not at all expensive for such quality.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
It keeps the road great and sits wonderfully on the asphalt.

35:30.000 --> 35:38.000
I like that after buying it, the admired looks of the audience are not addressed to me, but to my car.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
And this is just for $ 92,000.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Good luck.

35:43.000 --> 35:53.000
If you look again, listen to these ads, you will understand that it would seem that one target group, one and the same segment of consumers.

35:53.000 --> 36:05.000
But based on the fact that we arranged them in different ways from the point of view of the psychotype, for each of them we find our own version of the appeal,

36:05.000 --> 36:11.000
which is exactly this category of consumers should move to make a specific action.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
So, colleagues, we are moving on to the consideration of the concept of the brand.

36:17.000 --> 36:29.000
Today, the term brand has become so everyday that everyone thinks that this concept has been there since the very beginning.

36:29.000 --> 36:39.000
But there is a certain incorrectness in this idea, because the brand in the context in which it is used today,

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
used in professional literature, used in speech, etc.

36:45.000 --> 36:56.000
This term, which appeared in this context for a maximum of 10-12 years, in Russian practice, probably 5-7 years.

36:56.000 --> 37:03.000
Before that, believe me, we have been doing advertising and marketing for a long time, there was no such term.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
There was a concept of brand name, it was, it is, it has always been.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
But the brand name is exactly the name of the brand, not some kind of concept.

37:12.000 --> 37:22.000
Therefore, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the basis of the brand is still the understanding of the trade mark and the trademark.

37:22.000 --> 37:30.000
Why? Because only these two things are legally protected.

37:30.000 --> 37:43.000
Only the trade mark and the trademark you can register and can count on the state support in terms of protection of its use.

37:43.000 --> 37:57.000
A brand, as a myth, as a legend, as an image, as an association, it is legally impossible to register it.

37:57.000 --> 38:07.000
And so what we have in practice today, such a, I would say, a kind of negligent attitude to the registration of trade marks, it is very dangerous.

38:07.000 --> 38:17.000
As I understand it, you know no less than I do, more than when you do not register a trade mark, you start conducting an active advertising campaign,

38:17.000 --> 38:29.000
you come out as if to some good results and suddenly you find out that someone, quietly using this very moment, registered a trade mark on himself,

38:29.000 --> 38:39.000
waited until you reached some priorities in terms of the economy, and then, quite logically, came and made a claim to you for violating copyright.

38:39.000 --> 38:47.000
Therefore, colleagues, never miss this moment. The basis is the trade mark and the basis is the trademark.

38:47.000 --> 39:03.000
What does the trade mark give? It allows you to provide some additional cash flows due to the recognition of your trademark.

39:03.000 --> 39:15.000
Of course, colleagues, of course, any brand should and should almost always have a trademark registered.

39:15.000 --> 39:21.000
But not all trademarks or trademarks can be attributed to the categories of the brand.

39:21.000 --> 39:29.000
So, yes, the trademark is, as they say in mathematics, a condition necessary for the brand, but not enough.

39:29.000 --> 39:41.000
There are several terms in the category of the trademark. Trademark, trade names, trademark, corporate branding, corporate symbolism, corporate sign, certification sign.

39:41.000 --> 39:49.000
All these graphic symbols allow you to identify and distinguish yourself from what is offered on the market.

39:49.000 --> 40:01.000
All these symbols allow you to hope that the consumer will see you in the mass of offers, according to this chart, according to this symbolism, according to this designation.

40:01.000 --> 40:17.000
Accordingly, colleagues, when we start talking with you about choosing a brand name, every time we choose it, we need to think very well about how much later we can use this name in promotion and advertising.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.000
And here, as it were, there are some recommendations that I would like to draw your attention to. They are given on the slide.

40:23.000 --> 40:35.000
Recommendations on choosing a brand name. Here, the main thing is not to use the category they belong to as a name, do not use the abbreviation of the internal jargon.

40:35.000 --> 40:45.000
The most important thing, again, look, here it is well indicated, you may like or dislike the name of the brand, but the criteria for its choice will be only its positioning.

40:45.000 --> 40:55.000
From the point of view of positioning on the market, from the point of view of marketing. And this is the highest marketing task.

40:55.000 --> 41:16.000
You must agree that when our famous mobile operator MTS did the last rebranding and used this famous egg, the reaction to this new rebranding, to their new symbol, was completely inadequate and ambiguous among the masses of consumers.

41:17.000 --> 41:31.000
But the informational pressure they put, the massive advertising campaign they carried out, led to the fact that no one pays attention to it anymore.

41:31.000 --> 41:51.000
Of course, the ideal option is if the name of your brand makes some sense. But trying to necessarily put some meaning, for example, the names of the founders or something else, is not a mandatory element.

41:51.000 --> 42:01.000
Agree, colleagues, you all probably remember the famous rebranding of the company Gold Star, which is now called LG.

42:01.000 --> 42:19.000
After all, at that time, Gold Star had a completely unambiguous perception, had a kind of translation, and somehow everything was clear. The company decided to do a rebranding and introduced a new abbreviation LG, for which, in general, nothing makes sense.

42:19.000 --> 42:39.000
But nevertheless, you must agree that the vast majority of consumers today, already with difficulty, will remember that LG and Gold Star are the same company. Because some kind of massive advertising campaign passed, the brand was re-positioned in the consciousness, and in the end it pushed out the previous one.

42:39.000 --> 42:54.000
Accordingly, you probably know that, for example, Sony, Kodak, they never had any specific meaningful meaning. These are just beautiful sound names.

42:54.000 --> 43:14.000
Therefore, choosing a brand, it is necessary to proceed from the fact that it is then competently integrated into the complex. Of course, it should sound good, it should be easily pronounced, it, God forbid, should not have some ambiguous associations in different language cultures, especially if you are going to go to foreign markets.

43:14.000 --> 43:40.000
These are such axiomatic things that we will not dwell on in detail. The most important thing in a trading brand is that when I saw it, when I introduced it, I must understand for myself what this brand gives me in terms of some kind of potential for pleasure, for internal charge.

43:40.000 --> 43:56.000
Will it interest the consumer, who was absolutely indifferent to the content of your emotional connections? Maybe it will at least remember its writing, its presentation.

43:56.000 --> 44:14.000
And most importantly, how will this brand influence the prestige of the company, its image? And of course, we have already talked about the fact that any promotion, any advertising campaign, is a brand advertising campaign.

44:14.000 --> 44:36.000
Brand advertising campaigns are quite large financial costs, and therefore, obviously, it is necessary to understand from the very beginning whether these costs will lead to the promotion of this brand, to the recognition of your company, to the recognition of the brand and, as a result, of course, to the growth of sales.

44:36.000 --> 44:56.000
Brand and trading brand. You know, today there are a lot of talks about the valuation of the value, the valuation of the brand capitalization, the value of the brand. We will talk about this later. But I would like to draw your attention to the work that seemed to me quite curious in this direction.

44:56.000 --> 45:16.000
It is in your list of recommended literature. The book is dedicated to the strategic Keller, Kevin Keller, Strategic Brand Management. In my opinion, Kevin Keller put the trading brand in the corner and introduced several, if so, we can say, not fundamentally new, but several refined concepts.

45:16.000 --> 45:45.000
He introduced the concept of not the valuation of the brand value, but the consumer capital of the trading brand. In this case, as if on the slide, these definitions are given. What is consumer capital? This is a combination of associations and models of behavior of the trading brand, the channel participants and the mother company, which actually increases the volume of sales or profits and gives the most important thing, look, colleagues, a stable, differentiated, competitive advantage of the brand.

45:46.000 --> 45:59.000
The advantage of a marked product over a non-marked one. This is the main point, for which we develop the brand concept, for which we are so fighting to promote the trading brand.

45:59.000 --> 46:24.000
The differentiated advantage. He, Kevin Keller, introduced the following two concepts. The point of differentiation of the trading brand and the point of parity. What is the point of differentiation? Well, in general, what is differentiation? This is a distinction. In fact, the point of differentiation is those distinctive characteristics of your trading brand that say that your brand is different from that, that and that.

46:24.000 --> 46:47.000
Those of you who have seen the period of classical inventiveness and rationalization in the Soviet Union should remember that when you wrote an application for an invention, you described the advantages of your product, that the product is intended for this and that.

46:48.000 --> 47:06.000
And then there was such a mandatory phrase, which is different by the fact that. So, the point of differentiation is what distinguishes your brand from brands of similar goods or services. But Kevin Keller rightly noted another concept, the point of parity.

47:06.000 --> 47:24.000
It would be absolutely unreasonable to say that the trading brand is a computer manufacturer and is different from the trading brand of an office furniture manufacturer. These are different things. First, we are talking about one category of goods and services.

47:24.000 --> 47:45.000
That is, here, too, the concept of the point of parity is introduced, which means that the two brands are related to the same category of consumer goods. And the point of differentiation is within this basic satisfaction of this need, the solution of these tasks, its basic differences.

47:46.000 --> 48:02.000
Today, we have another concept in the literature, which is probably also very correct, and I would also like to draw your attention to it. This is the concept of the territory of the trading brand. The fundamental aspect of the marketing of a trading brand is the territory it occupies.

48:02.000 --> 48:22.000
That is, the basis on which the brand's personality is actually based, from which its whole character is created. For this, we need to know the truth about the product, know the opinion of the consumer about it and feel its character.

48:22.000 --> 48:44.000
To determine how competitive and distinctive it can be, how it will motivate the consumer to choose products and services of this particular brand, and how it will be able to distinguish and feel this difference between your product and the product of another brand.

48:44.000 --> 49:10.000
You, colleagues, should take into account and understand one thing that could be defined as postulate. The adherence of a brand to a brand is, in fact, a commitment to a club, a club of the chosen ones, a club of those who have realized these advantages.

49:11.000 --> 49:35.000
Clubhood is the basis of promoting loyalty, commitment, and so on. A club of loyal customers, a club of committed people. A club is initially a small group of friends who share certain values, certain standards of behavior, and so on.

49:36.000 --> 49:56.000
So, what is a brand? A myth, a legend, or a trading brand? In my opinion, a brand is a myth, a legend, as I said, based on which a trading brand is based.

49:56.000 --> 50:15.000
The very classical definition of a brand is given here on the slide of the perception of a brand. Why are we talking so much about a brand today? Why has this topic become so relevant? I have already said that this term did not exist before, and we used the term that was called the image of a company.

50:15.000 --> 50:41.000
You know, colleagues, we will touch upon this topic later. Russell Reeves, an American advertising expert, once said in his book, The Reality of Advertising, that if you want to make some kind of promotion, if you have a certain uniqueness in your product, in your service, then the entire advertising campaign is built on the hope for this uniqueness.

50:42.000 --> 50:53.000
You say, yes, I have some values that no one else has. And here, in general, it makes no sense to even think about what to play with.

50:53.000 --> 51:10.000
But if, as Reeves said, you do not have this uniqueness, and you would like to position yourself in relation to your competitors, then you start looking for that advertising motive that, let's say, has never been used in advertising before.

51:10.000 --> 51:32.000
I will not give examples that Reeves gave, but here is what we really saw in one of the Russian cities. A company that promoted the shoe store network made a banner all over the city that said, we have the right and the left together.

51:32.000 --> 51:44.000
You see, even a child in the mind that in a shoe store there can be only shoes for the left or right foot, probably cannot associate it in his head.

51:44.000 --> 52:02.000
But since no one has ever used this motto in promotion, they had a chance to play off some kind of attractiveness in this game, in this non-standard approach, and to arouse interest, to go to all these stores and see what is so unique there.

52:02.000 --> 52:21.000
And what to do when there is nothing here, and there is nothing in the motives to make you stop? So, no, there is no uniqueness of the product, no uniqueness of the motive that has never been used in advertising before, but you still want to stand out.

52:21.000 --> 52:45.000
And then, I repeat, this is my brand concept, then this idea appeared to go into positioning of the product, service, to move away from the direct property of its consumer value, and so on, and to go into a certain philosophy, into a certain associative series that may not be associated with the product at all.

52:45.000 --> 52:57.000
It is quite obvious that this is an approach that allows you to move away from the competitors, but it is also obvious, colleagues, that this field is also not limitless.

52:57.000 --> 53:13.000
In the end, there are not so many common associations, and psychologists have not accidentally established that, from the point of view of psychology of perception, the principle of 7 plus or minus 2 applies.

53:13.000 --> 53:25.000
That is, a person can really assess the advantages, that is, to distinguish them, specifically, in the range of 7 plus or minus 2.

53:25.000 --> 53:43.000
Therefore, it is not by chance that today experts say that it is possible that after some time, in each category of the product there will be no more than 7 plus or minus 2 brands, because then a person simply will not be able to find any fundamental differences between the first and the second.

53:43.000 --> 53:55.000
On the same slide, colleagues, you see five different levels of consumer attitude to the brand, from the point of view of the range in terms of the degree of increasing its significance.

53:55.000 --> 54:11.000
From completely indifferent, when I absolutely do not care when I choose a product, what brand, what brand, and so on, to, if so to speak, to semi-exclusive, that is, in the form of loyalty to a specific product and a specific consumer.

54:11.000 --> 54:26.000
The main thing I wanted to draw your attention to, colleagues, and this is a very important point, is that the brand should be considered not as some kind of staticity, and it is not by chance that this is said, the brand is a verb, not a noun.

54:26.000 --> 54:36.000
Although, from the point of view of the Russian language, the brand is, of course, a noun, but from the point of view of its impact, the promotion of a specific action of the consumer is certainly a verb.

54:36.000 --> 54:51.000
And so we, when we must clearly understand for ourselves that all employees of companies must contribute to the creation of a brand, and in no case to its leveling or destruction.

54:51.000 --> 55:02.000
So, colleagues, remember that the products themselves are created by you, created by your companies, and of course they belong to you, and the protection of copyrights, and so on.

55:02.000 --> 55:11.000
And the brands that you also create, you create this concept, and so on, it belongs to society and consumers.

55:11.000 --> 55:32.000
It is quite obvious that the image of the brand is an absolutely subjective thing and belongs only to it, since we have already said that people are all different in themselves, so you know, such a blue dream of marketologists to create such a global brand, it is initially unattainable and doomed to failure.

55:33.000 --> 55:41.000
To understand the nature of the brand, to understand why a consumer perceives one thing and another as difficult as human nature.

55:41.000 --> 56:03.000
But the most important thing is that we must strive for the brand that we have developed, the concept of the brand that we have developed, this is a kind of associative series that is combined with it, to be perceived by our target group of consumers as part of its essence, as part of its being.

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
And this is probably one of the most important marketing tasks.

56:08.000 --> 56:28.000
Here, again, look, colleagues, we create a brand for a specific person, but a person is not static, he ages, his views change, and, accordingly, the brand that he once chose, he must move with him.

56:28.000 --> 56:44.000
Therefore, the task of the company is to constantly track the changes in psychological perceptions, behavioral motives of its target group and, accordingly, to correct the brand concept.

56:44.000 --> 56:58.000
The main mistake that is made by many in the concept of the promotion of the brand is that you, following the consumer, begin to move from one side to the other.

56:58.000 --> 57:12.000
This is categorically unacceptable. Yes, you change the brand concept, you clarify it. Why? Because a person gets used to everything. He gets used to a certain audience, he gets used to a certain motto, a slogan, and so on.

57:12.000 --> 57:23.000
And, given that competitors constantly attack his consciousness, you can move away from his perception in a more backward way in relation to competitors.

57:24.000 --> 57:36.000
But this does not mean that there should be some kind of fluctuations from one concept to another. Conceptually, the image of the brand should remain in one vector, in one trend.

57:37.000 --> 57:51.000
And this is a very important point. Therefore, you should track it very carefully and follow your consumer, preserving some postulate basic values.

57:51.000 --> 57:59.000
What can be a key factor in influencing the consumer in terms of promoting the brand concept?

58:00.000 --> 58:09.000
This is, of course, first of all, his awareness of what we have already talked about, about his brand, about the product, about the service and everything that is related to your company.

58:09.000 --> 58:22.000
This is a kind of consumer association, that is, the intensity, demand and uniqueness of the characteristics and advantages of your company and your brand perceived by them.

58:23.000 --> 58:31.000
This is a kind of psychological attitude towards the consumer in terms of quality in relation to your brand and in terms of satisfaction.

58:31.000 --> 58:42.000
A very important indicator is, of course, adherence, as we said, that is, how much he remains at least loyal to your brand, to your brand.

58:43.000 --> 58:54.000
And, of course, the most important point, which, unfortunately, we have today in practice, as it were, is the analysis of the experience of interaction between the consumer and this brand.

58:54.000 --> 59:04.000
I remind you again that we can have a brilliant advertising campaign with you, we can move the masses to purchase our product, our services, and so on.

59:05.000 --> 59:21.000
But the experience of communication with the company, the experience of communication with the product, with the service, and so on, can be, alas, so negative that in the end, in the end, the adherence that he had, and the interest that he had, can just dissolve.

59:21.000 --> 59:36.000
And it will be almost impossible to return it to the loan of our brand for the second time, or it will be so expensive that it will hardly have any specific economic meaning.

59:36.000 --> 59:52.000
The definition of the price of the brand and the value of the brand. I have already told you that the price should be determined not from the point of view of the assessment of the value of the brand, but from the point of view of the assessment of the capital of the brand.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Here, such non-economic methods of assessment of the value of the brand are used. The method of measurement using tasks for arbitrary association, the design method evaluating the metaphorical meaning of the brand brand and the combination analysis.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:29.000
But, most importantly, colleagues, you should know for yourself that until now there is no single common method of assessment of the value of the brand. There are several options for assessment.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:52.000
While, let's say, the business community of the world has not come to the concept of how to reflect the non-material component in the traditional accounting. If we talk abstractly about what the brand value and the price of the brand is, then it would probably be more correct to say that the price of the brand is the value of a loyal client base.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:18.000
After all, in fact, you can have a wonderful office, amazing products of your service, very good staff, everything that can be considered positive, but for some reason consumers do not come to you. And why should I buy your company then? After all, I buy the company, I buy the actual value of your brand.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So, colleagues, you should know for yourself that there is no single common method of assessment of the value of the brand, methods of reflecting this value in traditional accounting until now.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:54.000
There are many methods, approaches, various methods, and so on. There is a famous consulting company, the international Interbrand, which, let's say, once a quarter publishes an expert assessment of 500 world brand leaders.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:12.000
But again, colleagues, you should understand that this is an expert assessment, and it is the opinion of specialists. Of course, an expert is a professional, a person who, of course, is based on the analysis of a huge array of information, but it is still an expert assessment.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Therefore, when we talk about the value of a brand, we always say that the real price of any brand, any company, is the price that was fixed during the transaction. A company was sold, and its price today is the price of the brand.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But if we talk about the general indicators, what is the assessment of the brand as such, then it would probably be more correct to associate this concept with the concept of a loyal customer base. What is the point of your office, what is the point of your product, what is the point of your service, what is the point of your very advanced and very polite, correct staff, if a specific customer does not come to your office?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Why do I need your building, why do I need your goods, and so on? After all, I, buying your brand, actually buy your loyal customer base. I buy the trust of those people who will still come and bring money flows to this company.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Therefore, when we talk about branding, we should not consider that the brand is a category exclusively of goods of mass demand. The brand, like the image of the company, is a concept that is fair to everything, including goods of mass demand, industrial goods, services, and even services such as medical services.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Another thing is that the specifics of the business sphere will have some peculiarities, and therefore, let's say, in the branding of industrial goods, it will be necessary to be more pragmatic, more specific, that is, to play more not on emotions, but on some technical characteristics, usefulness, and so on.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, look, yes, brands of industrial goods, well, they should be absolutely familiar to you, well, let's say, the most obvious brand is Gazprom, which is today, as it were, constantly promoted on central television with the general concept of support for children's sports and so on. Therefore, branding is not a thing that only applies to mass goods.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:46.000
On the next slide you see 10 of the most expensive brands in Russia in 2007. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that these are not the absolute 10 most expensive brands, but the assessment of the companies, the Interbrand, Zinssmeier Lux, which made up this rating.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:05:09.000
And here, just as a reference, I brought you the first 10 of these 40 so that you could just understand for yourself the order of numbers that we are talking about today.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:38.000
And above. Here you see the first ten, it is still under the assessment of the brand, yes, it did not even reach 10 billion. On the other hand, again and again, this is an expert assessment, because so far, well, let's say, there has been no precedent for the attempt to buy Beeline, there is Lukoil, there, let's say, so that someone specifically paid this amount, this more or less, and that it was possible to say that yes, at that moment, on that date, on that year, the price of such a brand was estimated at that price.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Another problem, as it were, related to the brand, and you know, today it is not by chance that this is fashion, fashion is in advertising, and it is among specialists, managers, and today one of the most fashionable topics is rebranding.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:18.000
For some reason, it seemed to everyone that why do we need to deal with the quality of the product, why do we need to improve the service, why do we need to motivate the staff, improve the office, and so on. We will take and simply invest huge money, we will carry out rebranding, and just the money flows, tomorrow they will flow like milk rivers into our company.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Colleagues, rebranding, that is, changing the brand concept that you used to use, in my opinion, is like a surgical operation.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Yes, again, this is an extreme case.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Look, colleagues, how rarely, how rarely world leaders are engaged in rebranding. Do not confuse the fact that world leaders periodically change advertising slogans, let's say, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and so on.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Periodically change the audience, change the videos, this is perfectly normal and correct. You kind of shake up my perception, but conceptually, conceptually you do not change anything.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And rebranding is precisely the repositioning of the brand brand in consciousness. Yesterday I was referring to this category, and today you are trying to explain to me that I should refer to another category.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And you are sure that I will perceive this completely unambiguously. Therefore, of course, the plus of rebranding is that after that, the advertisers have such a term, absolutely correct, which is called the blurred view.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:32.000
That is, after a certain perception begins to blur, rebranding is good, it refreshes the image of the brand, the image of the brand in the consumer's consciousness and allows, let's say, not to forget the consumer the brand to which he is accustomed.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:56.000
This is certainly its plus. But if rebranding turns into self-purpose, then it is very scary. In addition, any rebranding is a colossal money-saving. And most importantly, both in rebranding and in advertising, there is no clear, common-principled method of assessing its effectiveness.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And so it turns out that you can spend a lot of money hoping that it will be. But you will hardly be able to calculate this effectiveness. Therefore, rebranding, I repeat again, is akin to surgical intervention.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:37.000
There is another term, restyling. That is, when you do such a lightened rebranding, that is, without changing the concept, you change, let's say, some elements in the corporate style, and so on. All these methods are aimed at one thing, to shake the consciousness, to shake a certain idea of ​​the brand with which I connected myself, with which I give preference.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And this is done, of course, forcibly, because there are too many competitors in the market. In general, colleagues, you must understand that in business, and especially in advertising, altruism has never had a place, no, and will not.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:16.000
And if I, as it were, increase the advertising budget, if I start doing rebranding, then not out of any exclusions of these altruistic considerations, God forbid, but only because the competitive environment is such that my name, my brand and my brand begin to be pushed away in the consciousness of my target consumer from, say, competitors.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Therefore, every time you invest money in these serious approaches, you very carefully assess, at least predict and try to assess what exactly it will do, and most importantly, what exactly you can have from this.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:59.000
How to assess the development of the brand concept? Three years ago, in 2003, one of the Swedish experts in the field of marketing and management, Thomas Gett, wrote a book, 4D Branding, which, as we often have among our colleagues, any new direction in science, and especially when it comes from the West, is regarded as a kind of panacea for all cases of life.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Thomas Gett, in my opinion, did one very right thing. He proposed to anatomize the brand concept by two fundamentally key parameters.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:23.000
He introduced the concept of the thinking field of the brand, where the field of the brand is considered from the point of view of four dimensions, functional, social, spiritual and mental, and introduced the concept of the brand code.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:33.000
In this sense, Thomas Gett's merit is quite significant, because he proposed a practical tool for anatomizing the conceptual approach.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:43.000
But what I think is not quite right, what colleagues do now, they try to start developing the brand concept based on this structure.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
As a specialist with extensive experience, I would not recommend you to do this.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:00.000
When you have a conceptually matured idea of what kind of brand it is, how it is, what it is, and so on, then it would be more than fair to use Thomas Gett's method.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000
You just check, you know, some kind of a lacmus, test control, you look at how much you have taken into account.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But to start with this and to create it, I would not recommend.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Let's see how Thomas Gett's concept was used in the Sportmaster company, when they tried to write, to anatomize their brand field.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
So, functional measurements from the point of view of the Sportmaster company.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Everything for sports and recreation, a variety of types of goods and brands in one place.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Social measurements. Sport is not only fashionable, but also healthy.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Belonging to sports, healthy, beautiful, and, look how interesting it is written, and therefore successful people.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Yes, healthy, beautiful, and sports, and as a result, successful people.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Mental measurements. Encouragement to do sports, to lead an active lifestyle, both alone and with friends or loved ones.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Well, and spiritual measurements. Spiritual measurements, when you yourself will do, yes, the thinking field of your brand, it is always done in this way.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Yes, a little bit pathos, a little bit very philosophical. Health, family, joint leisure, communication.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:33.000
If we look at the brand code, what Thomas Gett proposed, then the brand code is essentially, you probably know that in the concept of marketing there is a concept of 4P.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Someone says about 4P, someone says about 5P, 7P, and so on.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Here, in fact, the brand code, the concept of the brand code proposed by Thomas Gett, is a certain option to inject, let's say, as he has 6 or 7P of marketing.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
This is a product of usefulness, this is a mission, this is positioning, this is a vision, this is a style, these are values.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Let's see how the brand code, from the point of view of Thomas Gett, how he interprets it, yes, using the example of SAS.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Here on the slide we have indicated, yes, the product of usefulness, that is, well, what is the essence of your brand?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The implementation of air flights within Scandinavia.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Look at what a wonderful mission, to glorify and stimulate Scandinavian culture.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Positioning, well, everything is simple here, a reliable world network, vision is also very, well, let's say, a certain element of pathos.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It is written here, all the inhabitants of Scandinavia must be proud of their airline.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
This is a wonderful phrase, must. Style and values.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I would like to pay special attention in the style section to the phrase warning.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Pay attention, colleagues, this word would seem to be absolutely ours, yes, native Russian, a good word, warning.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
That is, to be one step ahead of the consumer who wants something.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
To be, to warn that he may not even realize it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
For some reason, we have neither in the brand concepts, nor in the concepts, nor in advertising campaigns, practically nowhere, well, it is not used.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And it seems to me that here, as it were, there are, well, let's say, certain reserves from the point of view, so to speak, of your promotion.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Well, the rest of the things in style are clear here, this is what we see in any advertising, well, practically, probably, in advertising of any brand.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
There is equality, value, there is rationality, reliability, honesty.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
We will not discuss now how much they correspond to reality.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
In this case, we have already talked about this with you, that the promises that we give to the brand, well, should be adequate.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Yes, to the fact that the staff, if you remember, I already talked about it, will want and will be able to.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Therefore, the role of the staff in the promotion of the brand, it is huge.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It certainly does not replace the product, it certainly does not replace the service, and so on.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.000
But the staff can both promote the brand, and also, similarly, can bury it in its actions.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And this, please, colleagues, never forget, and therefore, you, as managers, should pay a lot of attention to this.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And the motivation of the staff, and promotion of it, and awareness of its value.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Therefore, as for the internal promotion of the brand among the employees of the company,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
this is by no means a less important task than promoting the brand as if to the external environment.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
For some reason, we still believe that the brand and everything that is associated with it,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
is the society, consumers, the target group, and so on.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And the employees, because if we declare one thing, and our employees in private conversations, and so on,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
do not share these values, then the reaction will be terrible.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
We must not forget that, probably, in our mentality, in our Russian mentality,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
the problem of the sarophane radio is incredibly high, and the sarophane radio can interrupt almost everything.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Therefore, never forget to pay attention to the internal communication on the promotion of the brand.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
In the development of any, and we have already talked about this, advertising company,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
the promotion of the brand, of course, lies a kind of creative message.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Creative is a thing, yes, creative, that is, a kind of creation, such creativity,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
a thing that is practically impossible to determine.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
How do genius ideas come?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Probably, no one has yet decided in humanity and could not describe

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
how much, why one can come up with a certain genius company, and the other does not.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
What moved him? I don't know if he was doing sports, if he was going somewhere, and so on.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Each creator has his own, how to say, his own ways that push him to some peaks.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And here I would like to draw your attention, colleagues, to the most important thing,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000
that yes, a creative, genius idea, it is, of course, a gift that not everyone has.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
But do not consider that a genius idea is like a manna from heaven,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
which can descend to the unfertilized soil.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Knowledge is always at the base.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Well, you must agree, colleagues, that neither Newton nor the first apple fell on his head.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
The Archimedes was not the first to bathe in the bath.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
But it was they who saw and created these discoveries.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Therefore, the basic knowledge, it must be necessary.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You must analyze the situation, you must monitor the techniques and experience of advertising companies, and so on.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000
But whether a genius idea will come or not, this is already a question as if the following.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:50.000
But if you have not laid the foundations, then to hope that a brilliant idea of promotion,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:01.000
some bright, correct, it will come, well, almost crazy, and it is unlikely that it is really worth seriously counting on.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
The most important thing I would like to draw your attention to,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
here on this slide, the creative advertising message of the brand.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Look, advertisers cannot be tempted to convince their clients,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
clients are if you are an advertising agency, or in this case a client, let's say,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
as your manager, a division, or maybe even a company,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
in full proof of their advertising idea.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:35.000
We can only talk about the fact that all the most conscientious attempts to refute it ended in failure.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Therefore, the manager or the client can be confident enough to agree with the proposal to implement it.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
But on the question of whether you are sure that there can be no more effective idea,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.000
to be honest, to answer no, because you can never be sure of that.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
You just understand, yes, as it is said here, we must say how,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
we believe that if more people learn about the existence of this product,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000
then more people will buy it, or already existing consumers will buy it more often.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
That is, when we say that we only believe, we assume,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
why can't we say that there is no more ingenious idea?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Maybe we just didn't find a way to refute it.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Here, unfortunately, in advertising, yes, how can I tell you,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
the method of trial and error is almost the only one, probably.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
There are many methods of increasing efficiency and so on,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
but you are never insured from an error, because the social environment is too complex,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
the aura is too complex, everything changes too quickly in a situation.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Therefore, you, as a professional, say that I did everything I could.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I tested everything, all the arguments that could only be taken into account

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
in order to exclude some kind of error.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
But, unfortunately, I missed some argument.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And so I say that I hope that the company will allow this misinformation,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000
that people will buy more, and those who have already bought will buy more often.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So, how can you still activate your creative thinking?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
You know, colleagues, there are quite a few ways to create creative thinking,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
to find creative ideas.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000
But, oddly enough, historically, one of the most used examples

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
still remains the rule of brainstorming, etc.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
What is its main approach?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
The main approach is that you, as if, conditionally,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
divide your entire audience, naturally, people who are more advanced,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
with a more sophisticated thinking, etc.,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
into two groups, let's say.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
People who have a very good idea generation,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
and people who are more pragmatic, but who can, it would seem,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
translate this fantastic idea into a certain specific plane.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Just so you know the history of the concept of brainstorming,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:22.000
it goes from a parable that once, at the beginning of the last century,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
one of the captains of the British Navy's warship

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
gathered the sailors on deck and said,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
friends, we have such a problem, we are regularly attacked by German boats,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
torpedoes are sent to us, we are suffering, let's all think together

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
what we could do to resist this attack.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And then, supposedly, one of the sailors said,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
my captain, and so that we, the whole team, do not stand along the side of the ship

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
where we expect the attack, and when we see the torpedo,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
start blowing on the wave, create a certain wave,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
the ship will maneuver, the torpedo will go, and so on.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
It would seem, from such an absolutely crazy idea,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
in a common sense, people came to a completely specific solution,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
it was then patented, and so on.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
The same is true here.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
The ideas that are expressed, this is the basic rule of brainstorming,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
cannot be discussed or criticized in any case.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Not only any criticism of the idea itself is categorically prohibited,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
but also any hints of some kind of inferiority,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
and inability to think of someone from the participants of this creative group.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Then these ideas are collected, there are many technologies,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
recording on a recorder, on video, and so on,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
and transferred to a group of analysts,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:48.000
who are trying to find some interesting solutions in the associative row.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
There are other techniques, such as the six-hat method, and so on.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
There is a method of synaptics, it is more advanced,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
that is, you can say, a variant of synaptic analysis,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
it is an advanced version of brainstorming, that is, controllable brainstorming.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
By the way, the method of synaptics, according to the brainstorming, colleagues,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
there is a lot of literature on the Internet, a lot of books.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
In synaptics, there are much fewer books, probably, the book of Osborne himself,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
it was published somewhere in the late 1940s.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
By the way, Osborne, one of the authors of synaptics,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
is one of the founders of the famous BBDO company,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
whose name is made up of the first letters of the last four founders.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Osborne is the last founder, and he is the author of this concept,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
BBDO company, you should understand that it is one of the leaders

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
in terms of promotion of the brand concept, advertising, and so on.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
As for how much, we have already talked about it,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
about humor in advertising, that humor and game are in the first place

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
in terms of attracting the attention of consumers.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
But again, colleagues, again, you have to be very, very careful here.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Here, on these slides, you see the main points

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
that I would like to draw your attention to,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
when you decide, let's say, to use this humor in advertising your company,

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
in advertising your brand.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
The principles of humor and good advertising are the same.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
And the first and the second should open a hidden meaning to the viewer.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
What is the main thing here?

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
You see, colleagues, the Russian language is so rich

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
that a competent use of humor can work very well

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
for your brand, for your product, for your brand,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
creating some very good, kind and wonderful associations.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But at the same time, colleagues, there are some dangers.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Therefore, you should remember that humor in advertising

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
should always correspond to the nature of the product.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
That is, it is inappropriate, let's say, for some kind of,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
you know, yes, life is life, we have, let's say,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
today such a service as ritual services.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And probably humor in this section would be completely inappropriate.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Although one of the founders, if so to speak, of ritual services in Russia,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Vladimir Sterligov, who was the first to address,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
well, he has been engaged in these services for a long time,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
but the first to start using such advertising,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
such classic slogans and approaches in his advertising,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
used such a slogan, let's say,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
that is, you will fit in our coffin.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
How appropriate is this in this case, this is a very controversial issue.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Further, yes, good human humor can contribute to the formation of an audience

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
of positive opinion about the manufacturer of the product.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Subtle and real life situations allow the consumer to laugh not at himself,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
but at someone else.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
A funny, exaggerated situation, a cut in life,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
a bad personal situation, some kind of housing confusion.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
These are good decorations for a positive opinion about the product.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
As for the use of children in advertising,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
here you need to be very, very careful.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
On the one hand, yes, the use of children, good children,

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
such positive, wonderful children, it creates a certain positive aura.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
But on the other hand, they may sometimes not convey

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
the advertising message that you would like,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
so that the impact that you would like to be.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Well, participation in humorous advertising of some

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
over-hybridized comic characters can offend

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
some part of a certain category of your consumers.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Parody or joke.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
If it is done well and done for famous things,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
then it will most likely be perceived positively

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
by your consumers, from your target group.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Remember, we talked about creative advertising,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
we talked about all the possible arguments

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
that I could use to assess

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
how effectively I offer.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I used.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
One of the ways to use such arguments

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
is the so-called rapid test tests of the prepared

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
advertising message of your brand.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Here they are, as if you have them on the slide.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
They are quite democratic, quite simple,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
and most importantly, simple in terms of use.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
The first is a quick look test.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Take a look, read only the titles,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
subtitles, signatures, illustrations,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
the selected sections of the text, and then ask yourself a question.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Did it become clear to you what exactly you are offering?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Why will your offer be beneficial to a particular reader,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and most importantly, will he want to read it further?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
The essence of this test is that the answers should be only positive.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
The second is an understanding test.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Let someone read the advertisement to someone who is in your target audience,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
but is not yet familiar with your product.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Can a person, having read the text once,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
understand the meaning of the offer, what it will have in particular?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And of course, the answer here should be only one.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Everything should be absolutely clear to him.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
How does your ad differ from the ad made by your competitor?

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
How clearly does your uniqueness, your competitive advantage, stand out?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
To do this, let your competitor read your ad,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and ask him to rate it.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Did he manage to find something positive in you

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
in relation to what your competitors offered?

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
The next test is a test of understanding.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
The next test is a so-called finger test.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
First of all, erase all these wonderful words from the text,

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000
such as «we are the best», «we are the most outstanding», «we are super-wonderful» and so on.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
With all the colleagues, these words are quite common,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and are used quite often in advertising.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
They still work better or worse,

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:57.000
but excessive use of them, not confirmed by arguments, is very dangerous.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Therefore, in the second part, in those places where you want to refer to something specific,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000
it is better to do so, it is better to write «number one» in the rating of such a magazine,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
than, for example, «the best in the market as such».

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000
But if you still risk using praise words,

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
some kind of reviews,

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:32.000
then be sure to use the actual data of those people who write these reviews.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
The most important thing is the mistake that many colleagues make today.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
You give reviews, maybe absolutely honest,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
that is, it can not be, but most likely, absolutely honest and reliable, and so on.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
From people who, for me, as your potential consumer,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
have no value from the point of view of, say, authority, yes, absolute.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And so that you gave this review, so that you did not give it at all.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.000
If you give a review of a person who is perceived by a potential consumer as «yes, this is really an authority»,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
«yes, this is really a name», «yes, if he says it, then probably so», «then yes».

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Therefore, be very careful with reviews, be very careful with the use of statistics.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It should, again, be perceived by a potential consumer as some kind of almost reliable.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Well, and the last two tests, yes, the test for similarity and the test for clarity.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Well, ask to look at the text, note the statement,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
the statement that is difficult to pronounce, is difficult to understand,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
correct everything that will be noticed,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000
and during this test, note the phrases, thoughts that are difficult to understand right away.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
After all, you understand, you should not count on me trying to read your text.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I say again that since there is a lot of competition,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
it will be easier for me to look at the advertisement of the competitor and try to figure it out,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.000
rather than trying to understand what you meant here, behind the line, and so on.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
The most important thing, colleagues, yes, the most important thing,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
you must understand that, unfortunately, or fortunately, in some cases,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
or rather, unfortunately, in another case, fortunately,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
the versatility of the Russian language gives you some advantages in advertising,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
which you would hardly ever find somewhere, so to speak, working in the foreign market.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
And probably about the same number of dangers.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Dangers from the point of view of the fact that you may not always be able to predict

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:43.000
the reaction that will arise in the process of reading your advertising message.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I am no longer talking about professional parodies that are made there,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
well, our famous actors, and so on.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Associatively, the people who see it may have associations that will be completely far from what you have conceived.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
As for the inadequacy of the perception of individual advertising texts,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
some experts believe that if a parody is made for your ad,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
what is now called, and it went to the people,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
and this is a fashionable topic, virus marketing, then this is wonderful,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.000
and now you are kind of on the hearing, and people began to purchase your goods, your services.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
But agree, colleagues, that this is not always unambiguous.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
The very fact that I remembered the parody does not mean, and I liked it,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
and I may even tell it to my colleagues, retell it, and so on,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
does not mean the most important thing, that I decided to use your product.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000
In addition, we must never forget that in the theory of information technology there is a wonderful concept,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
the second law of Chisholm.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.000
It states that if your message has caused at least one person

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
an inadequate, unplanned association,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000
there is a high probability that the same association will cause the second, third, fourth and fifth.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And so when you prepare advertising slogans about the brand concept,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
try to test them initially.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I just collect, collect examples of advertising texts,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
which have, well, which, as it were, let's say,

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
cause far from a clear association when I see them.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Well, for example, just to make it clear what we are talking about.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Back in 1996, when we worked in an advertising agency,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
a magazine was published in the Izvestiya publishing house,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
which was called Security for Security,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
and they had such a subordinate advertising slogan,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
a magazine for those who want to survive.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
We were also working at the same publishing house, the Izvestiya publishing house,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
and we called our colleagues and jokingly told them that, friends,

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000
this is a very interesting idea, and you have pushed us to release a suicide magazine,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
a magazine for those who do not want to live.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
That is, classic marketing, yes, if there are those who want to survive,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
then there should be those who, well, as it were, want to get rid of this life.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
They were so offended and said, what are you going to print about?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
We say, well, yes, some recommendations on how to choose the dosage correctly,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
the distance, calculate the rope, the height, and so on, and so on.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
But they say, well, okay, and release it.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
To which we replied, that everything would be great,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
but there are no permanent subscribers.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
If those who want to survive, then there will be those who will,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
but those who do not want to, they once read it, and they no longer need it.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I once again draw your attention, colleagues,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
that this is an association that arose personally with me, with my colleagues.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
But it is not a fact that it will not arise with someone else.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.000
You see, yes, and therefore you must be very, very careful when you do this.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And, for example, you know, I was personally amazed,

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
just amazed when in one of the Central Russian cities,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
well, let's say, of an average scale, and in my opinion,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000
of an average population, the city was all decorated with straps with such a phrase,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
unprecedented sale of diamonds.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
You know, when we went with a colleague, the first thought was such that,

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
close your eyes, abstract yourself and imagine yourself somewhere,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
well, I don't know, there in Cannes, in Nice, in Zurich, and so on.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
That is, it was so incompatible, as it were, well, let's say,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
what you see around you, and such a topic,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
that involuntarily, as it were, some questions arose about what, what and how.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Well, and here is an example that I cannot help but give,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
which, oddly enough, we have seen for, well, probably more than five or seven years.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
One of the departments of the State Security, State Security of Russia,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000
traditionally, on the eve of March 8, publishes,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
this is not Moscow, this is the region, publishes such an advertising ad.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Dear women, in connection with the upcoming celebration of March 8,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
we propose to insure yourself from an accident with a discount.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
You see, when you read this ad,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
personally, as it were, my first association that arises,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
it seems to say that there will be an International Women's Day,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
and it means that there will definitely be some problems,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
God forbid, there will be some accident.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:42.000
But since it's your holiday, here are some bonuses, some gifts from us.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Therefore, be very, very attentive.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I warn you again and say that, of course, colleagues,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
a priori, to say that everything can be excluded,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
well, it would be a direct delusion, in its purest form.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
It is impossible to exclude everything,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
because the association that arises, as it were,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
among people, it can be so unpredictable

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
that you can't even expect it,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
and you've probably encountered it, let's say,

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
on wall inscriptions, etc.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
In the subway, this is very often seen.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
But to try to do this,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
it is necessary to put it as a rule,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and to exclude this factor to the maximum.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
What are the main mistakes, if you can say so,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
in advertising campaigns promoting the brand?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Probably the biggest mistake that is made today

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
by many of our Russian advertisers

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
in the concept of promoting the brand

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
is the absence of a constant advertising image.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Some kind of shabbyness, what we were talking about,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
this is rebranding, which you use just, you know,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
well, it's fashionable, everyone does it, let's do it too.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And you don't let me understand and build a bridge of association

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
with whom I am, with whom I am.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
You know, some of you are older,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
who may remember, went through the field of Russian literature at school.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Maxim Gorky's letter to cultural figures,

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
if you remember, it was called like this.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Who are you, cultural figures?

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
So, who am I when the brand?

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
After all, when you create a certain myth,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
a certain image, a certain fairy tale, a certain association,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
you build a bridge between me and you,

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
and I understand who I am.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
When you change the advertising concepts of the brand

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
two or three times a year, as we did at one time,

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
if you remember, we did cellular operators,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
we changed, changed the brand's advertising concepts fundamentally,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I began to get lost and could not understand who I was.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I am this, or I am another, or I am the third.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
This is categorically unacceptable.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
After all, I associate myself, I try on this brand,

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I hang it on myself, it's part of me.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I get some kind of inner satisfaction

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
that I am part of this.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
And in fact, even if you create a brand,

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
which we have already talked about,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
it only gives an economic effect when I, your consumer,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
say, this is my brand, this is part of me.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Only then am I ready to pay for it.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Therefore, it is not the movement behind me,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
the brand is with me, I change the image,

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I change with me, and the brand changes.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I became older, and the brand somehow changed the accents a little.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
And so, today I am a motorcyclist,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and tomorrow I am a swimmer,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
the day after tomorrow I do not know,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
an alcoholic, God forbid, or something else.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
This is categorically unacceptable.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
That is, the movement, or it should be absolutely justified.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
You know, it seems to us that this is also

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
the reception of today.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Here, even under the Soviet government,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
in the late 70s, early 80s,

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
in Simferopol there was a plant that traditionally produced

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
the TV of Crimea.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Black and white, well-recommended,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
supplied abroad, and so on.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And when they, under the same brand,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
began to produce colored TVs,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
they had some problems with quality.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And then, to distinguish in consciousness

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
that traditional brand of Crimea,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
this stability, this good quality,

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
reliability, and so on,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
and new colored, which they, of course,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
held a number of events to improve the quality.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
They designated a new brand for colored TVs.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
They called them Photon.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Not to hide that these are TVs from Crimea.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
So it was. Photon, TVs from Crimea.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
This was a classic rebranding,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
but a rebranding that was absolutely forced,

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
because too much, well, as if the negative

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
was transferred to this brand.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Well, what else can be attributed to the typical mistakes

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
of today's Russian brand companies?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
This is sometimes a creative that is torn from reality,

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
when creative ideas that do not reflect

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
the essence of the brand.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
There are more than enough examples.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Well, my favorite example is

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
a wonderful Twix ad, in my opinion,

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
where a woman in the office, the manager feels,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
says that when her colleague has problems,

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
she, you remember, so beautifully,

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
with a hand, throws the laptop,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and they drink coffee or tea with this Twix.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
You know, where is the price of a laptop,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
and where is the price of this Twix,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
they are somehow completely in different weight categories,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
and it is completely incomprehensible

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
why and why this is done.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Well, probably, there are quite a lot of mistakes there,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
but they are not so fundamental,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
but probably two on which I would like to pay special attention.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
This is not attention to details.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Unfortunately, when you watch the ad carefully,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
you see such offensive little things,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
then suddenly, as if children with different eyes colors,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
for some reason, in one frame there is one child,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
they seem to be small, they all look alike,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
but you see that the color of the eyes is not the same.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Some other details that do not correspond to reality.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It would seem, Lord, think what kind of a child she is,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
but it's nonsense.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
But today our consumer is so professional

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
that he notices it all.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
It is already noticed not just by those people who track,

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
work, or maybe your competitors,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
to use it somehow,

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
but here is a specific consumer to whom you do it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And, of course, excessive fascination

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
with the use of celebrities in advertising.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
It's not a matter of business,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
we have athletes and great actors there,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
and they drink some coffee,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
which does not correspond to their status,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
and they eat some products,

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
which are clearly not associated with the consumer,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
with the fact that these people can be.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
You see, when you use a celebrity,

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
you must necessarily proceed from the fact

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
that I, your target consumer,

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
had a clear idea that yes,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
this great man,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
if this great man really drinks this super expensive product,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
or rides this expensive car,

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
and I want to be like him,

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
then I will perceive it as it is.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
But if I can't get it in my head

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
how this great actor,

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
famous, rides, let's say,

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
not on that brand of car,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
or eats not those products,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
or wears not the same clothes,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
then all your desire to move me

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
to a positive attitude to your brand,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
it will be like,

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
well, it's like the forces, yes,

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
will be completely empty

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
and they will hardly give something specific.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Naturally, we have already talked about this, colleagues,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
that everything that concerns advertising,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
everything that concerns the brand,

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
is a cost,

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
and this should never be forgotten.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And therefore, despite the fact

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
that we cannot determine,

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
we cannot determine the effectiveness of advertising costs,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
we cannot, well, how to say,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
calculate to the comma

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
how much the money we invested has been paid off,

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
this in no way

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
can mean that

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
this should not be done.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
But most importantly,

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
when you plan the budget

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
for the promotion of the brand,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
proceed from the banal understanding

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
that the budget for the promotion of the brand

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
is the budget for marketing communications.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
There is no separate advertising

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
outside the marketing complex.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
There is no brand budget

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
outside the budget of the entire

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
marketing communications complex.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
If you divide them,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
you will find yourself

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
in exactly big problems.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
That is, there will be

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000
absolutely wonderful advertising,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
amazingly expensive, so to speak, videos,

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
massive rental, television,

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and so on and so forth.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
That is, everything that could be

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
used in the right,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
healthy calculation,

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
but the effects are a little,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
because the rest of the complex

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
as such will not be used.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And therefore,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
you must,

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
when planning a marketing

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
communications complex,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
initially calculate the cost

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
of one contact

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
with a potential consumer,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
the cost of expenses

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
to maintain

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
its loyalty.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
The loyalty program,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
including the loyalty program

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
to the brand,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
is initially not earned

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
by you money.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And you must go

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
on this

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
completely consciously.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Therefore, at least approximately

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
calculate what you will get

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
the loyalty of this consumer,

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
what you will get

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
the interest of a potential

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
consumer and how much

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
this is acceptable.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
That is, the indicator

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
which is called profit

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
on the one hand,

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
divided by the cost of contact

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
which you must calculate

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
and take into account.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Here on the slide you see

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
the applicability of the ROTC indicator,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
that is, the profit,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
the price of contact for various

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
direct sales with the presence of a service,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
sales through the retail network.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And here, where and in what cases

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
ROTC calculation is possible,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
in what cases

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
it is almost impossible,

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
because it requires

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
as if accumulation of data,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
and in what cases

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000
for calculation of this indicator.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
So, we are talking about

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
that yes, so far

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
the professionals have a common opinion

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
about the assessment of the effectiveness

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
of advertising campaigns,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
about the effectiveness of campaigns

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
on the promotion of the brand.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
From the point of view of consensus, no.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
There are many methods.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I wanted to offer your attention

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
two methods that, in my opinion,

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
could be used,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
recommended as some practical.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
The first method

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
is the method of operational advertising,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
operational control of advertising expenses.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
This is the so-called before and after method.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Here on the slide you see

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
what is done here.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Two markets are chosen,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
the market is controlled

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
and the market is tested.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Colleagues, well, we, as professionals,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
must understand that absolutely two

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
absolutely identical markets

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
cannot be by definition.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Well, it just cannot be by definition

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
that the markets will always be different.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
But they are conditionally similar

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
in structure,

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
in situations, and so on.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And just what is the difference

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000
between the controlled and the tested?

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
The controlled is the market

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
on which we, like,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
direct advertising influence

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
do not carry out.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
The tested is the one

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
on which we carry out

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
direct advertising influence.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
What are we measuring here?

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
To show what indicators are assessed here.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Before the start of the advertising campaign

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and on another market,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
and after the end of the advertising campaign,

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
and how the indicators have changed.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Two key indicators.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
The company's awareness

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
of the company or its brand

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
and the company's positive attitude

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
to the company or its brand.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
How are these indicators measured?

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Well, here, as if everything,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
again, is a method of expert assessments.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
This is either a market study,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
a traditional marketing study,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
or a focus group method.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000
But again, both of these studies,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000
absolutely, do not give you a guarantee.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000
And both studies

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
can only give

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
a kind of forecast assessment.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
And two purely quantitative indicators,

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
which, in principle, can be measured.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
The number of calls to the company,

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
that is, how many calls were made

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
during this period of the campaign,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
of interested consumers,

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
and, roughly speaking,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
the volume of implementation in rubles as such.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
This method, of course,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
allows you to quickly assess

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
what and how has passed

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
and how much your advertising

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
has aroused interest

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
in a potential audience.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
A more complex, more complete,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
more, well, let's say,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
on the one hand, more laborious,

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
and on the other hand,

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000
more, if it is possible to say,

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
effective method.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
This method is called VS,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
investment result.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Here, look, colleagues,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000
on the slide,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
what indicators are measured here.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
The first is that two periods are taken.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And what is assessed?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Investments in advertising campaigns,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
but in brackets, you see,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
it is written here,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
in all marketing communications.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
What does this mean?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And direct marketing,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
and personal relations with the client,

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
and sending them letters,

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
and the Internet,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
and temporary negotiations, and so on.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Further, the number of calls

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
in units,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
that is, how many calls were there at all

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
in this period,

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
when we conducted this advertising campaign with you.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
The next indicator is the one

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
that we have already seen with you.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
The ratio of marketing investment

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
is one call.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
That is, for the first time you start to say

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
what we got

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
one call

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
of a potential consumer.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
That is, what price did he get us?

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
The next, yes,

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000
here is a very important indicator.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000
The percentage of transition

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
determined as a ratio

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
of the number of calls,

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
and here you understand

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
that the question is not in advertising

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
as such, as an advertising campaign,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
how it went, an advertising campaign,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
but how much the whole company worked,

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
and first of all the front office.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
How well the employees worked

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
after the attention was attracted.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And the last one,

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
the ratio of investment

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
to the attraction of one consumer

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
to the income from the deal.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
In fact, this method allows you

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
to determine the initial cost

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
of contact with a potential consumer

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
and assess how the front office worked

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
and in the future,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
when you plan marketing communication budgets,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
to draw from this indicator.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Thus, colleagues,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
this method,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
VES, investment, result,

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I would recommend you use

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
periodically,

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
not more than once every six months,

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
but maybe once a year.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Why? Because it is quite difficult

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
to calculate this indicator

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
of investment in all marketing communications.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
That is, if you hold

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
some advertising campaign,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
a brand campaign,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
as a short-term campaign

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
to stimulate sales,

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
then the method before and after

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
is a good enough method

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
in terms of assessing its effectiveness.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
In addition,

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
it probably allows you

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
to assess the economy.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
That is, when we do

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
short-term advertising campaigns,

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
we can use the short-term indicators

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
of advertising campaigns

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
and set money indicators,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
that is,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
to get some priority

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
in money,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
in the flow, and so on.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
If we are talking about

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
advertising campaigns

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
as a brand concept,

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
promotion of the brand,

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
then, firstly,

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
the short-term period is not very suitable here,

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
because it is very difficult to understand

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
how people remembered,

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
how they do it, and so on.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
And this should be taken into account

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
of the whole complex.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Therefore,

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
if the second part,

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
then we suggest using the method of VES,

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
that is, the method of investment and results,

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
which will allow you to imagine

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
a more complete picture,

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
let's say,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
of what you spent

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
and what you got.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
But at the same time, colleagues,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
you must understand

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
that you should not have illusions

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
about the fact that everything is reliable.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
There are no tools

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
that would allow you

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
to calculate everything with mathematical accuracy.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Unfortunately,

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
the most popular today

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
in assessing the quality of prepared advertising works,

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
effectiveness, impact, and so on,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
the focus group method,

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
it also suffers

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
largely

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
from the element of subjectivism

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
of those people,

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
those experts who entered this focus group.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
After all, you understand,

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
yes, we say, suppose,

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
that people who entered the focus group

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
from the point of view of sociology,

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
from the point of view of the respondents' selection,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
reflect a layer.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
But I say again,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
we are so different

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
that it is absolutely impossible

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000
to guarantee that it will be absolutely accurate.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And there is no precedent for this

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
in the practice of advertising companies,

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
both Russian and foreign,

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
more than.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
But I want to draw your attention again

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
that despite the fact

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
that there is an element of subjectivism here,

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
the method of assessing focus groups,

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000
the developed advertising slogans,

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
and so on,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
remains one of the key tools.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And the methods of assessing the effectiveness

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
of the campaigns carried out by the advertising companies,

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
those that I mentioned,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
again, are included,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
let's say,

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
in the top key methods of assessing

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
the effectiveness of campaigns

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
promoting the brand.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
What I would like to say

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
in conclusion about the brand concept

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
and its promotion

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
to the competitiveness of the company.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Colleagues, the brand is certainly

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
a very important thing

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
in terms of increasing

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000
the competitiveness of the company.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Why?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Because with a positive attitude

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
to it from your target audience,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
you are guaranteed

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
to have a loyal client base

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
that determines

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
the non-drying stream

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000
of money

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000
that comes from them to you.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Therefore,

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
this is certainly

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
an absolutely right and positive thing.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
It is also important

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
that any promotion of the brand

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
is absolutely costly.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
And these are the money

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
that you could spend

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
on some other purposes.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Therefore,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
you need to approach this

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
very consistently,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
systematically and regularly.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000
You see, the brand is not

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000
what you once created,

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
once made an advertising shield,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
once you hanged up

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
the codexes,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
the rules of Da Heart

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
and the brand,

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
and so on.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
And you think that the task is over.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
The brand requires constant support,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
some kind of adjustment,

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
some kind of update.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000
And most importantly,

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
what I have repeatedly

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
drawn your attention to,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
in accordance with its promises

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
and real action.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Further on the slides,

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I have mentioned

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000
the successful brand management.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
The promises are a bit pathos,

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000
but in principle,

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
they reflect the essence of the issue

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
absolutely correctly and accurately.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
So, where do they start?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Create a brand style.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
This is all that is related

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
to the brand symbolism,

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
to the traditional elements

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
of the brand style.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Once there was a concept

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000
of a catalog of the brand style.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Today it is very fashionable

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
to have a brand book,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
which, in fact,

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
combines these rules,

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.000
logos,

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
graphics,

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
and so on.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
The only thing I would like

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
to draw your attention to,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
colleagues,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
is that the brand book should

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
not only concern the external design,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
not only the advertising elements,

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
the blanks, letters,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
advertising accounts,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
booklets, and so on.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
The style of the behavior

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
of the front office employee

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000
is not the phrase

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
that is said on the phone

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
when you call the front office.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000
The style of business letters

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
is not the phrase that is said

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000
on the phone when you call the front office.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.000
When we talk about a brand book,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
it is considered as a brand style

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
of blanks,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
that is, an envelope,

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
a location, an emblem,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
a trademark,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
and so on.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
And I see it

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
from some anchor point,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
as psychologists say,

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
and I say,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
this company is like this,

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000
why?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
According to the structure of the letter,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
according to some first phrase,

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000
according to some conclusion,

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000
according to some abstractions,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
and according to the location.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And the same applies to the style of communication.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
This also applies to the categories of the brand book.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Unfortunately,

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
this is not the case.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
The next commandment is

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000
to formulate the values of the brand.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
That is, I must understand

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.000
as your potential consumer

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.000
what is valuable for me personally,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
what is the advantage of your brand,

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
why is it important for me,

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000
why do I wear it,

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
and why do I consider it

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
a part of myself.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Why, using your product

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
or using your service,

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I feel,

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
how to tell you,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
how to tell you

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000
that I am a part of a certain club of the chosen ones.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000
A club of the chosen ones,

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
a club of those who assess it,

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
understand it, and so on.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Next, formulate the positioning of the brand.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
That is, the brand must, of course,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
position itself absolutely clearly

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
from the point of view of

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000
who is the buyer of this product.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
You know, for example,

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I really like

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
such a classic positioning of the brand,

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000
which was made by the company

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Harley Davidson.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
After all, if you know the history of this company,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
you know that in fact

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
the company has no

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
basic know-how in the product.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
There is no such thing.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
It is not defined.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
It is correct to say

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000
that there are specialists

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
who say that if we,

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
our heavy motorcycle Ural,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
which is generally a little bit

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000
design-wise,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000
and most importantly

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
created this concept of the brand,

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
then it is no worse to promote it

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
than Harley Davidson.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
After all, Harley Davidson is a legend

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.000
that was created and invented.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
And it has a completely clear

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000
positioning.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000
When they tell you Harley Davidson,

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
you imagine a man,

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
you are definitely somewhere in the region,

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
so to speak, more than 30-35 years

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
absolutely established.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Because Harley motorcycles

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000
are usually not bought

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
as the only vehicle.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Most likely in all leather,

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
most likely with long hair

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
and so on.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Here is an absolutely clear

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
positioning of the brand.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
And when I want to become them,

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I understand if I buy this motorcycle,

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
who am I, what am I,

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
with whom am I.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Further, the following message.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Strive to improve the brand advertising.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I say again that advertising

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
should always speak in the language

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
understandable to the consumer.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
But clarity does not mean primitiveness.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
You understand this.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
But the use of slang expressions,

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000
and sometimes, let's say,

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000
not very correct,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
it is dangerous.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Do not ever go down to,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
how to tell you,

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
to the level of the consumer,

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.000
which is the lowest in your group,

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000
so that he also understands it.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Still, the language should be understandable

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
from the point of view of terminology

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000
and so on.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Yes, I must understand what it is about,

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000
but at the same time,

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000
the brand and its task is

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
to improve the brand.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Well, keep up with the consistency,

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
we have already talked about this.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Keep up with the synergy of the brand architecture.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
If you add some properties to the brand,

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
then they should contribute

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
to the satisfaction of the consumer's expectations,

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
which he has formed

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
in the process of changing the aura of the society,

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
or maybe just his age preferences.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
The most important thing,

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
constantly study your brand,

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
test its relationship,

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
to it from the side of your consumers.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
How much do consumers know about it,

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
how much do they associate

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
its main criteria

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
as you would like it.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
That is, you know, colleagues,

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
monitoring for the behavior of the consumer,

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
monitoring for his attitude to the brand,

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
this is a thing that should be put into practice

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
by each of the managers.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
You see, we are still,

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
as I said,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
we cannot achieve this in management,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
so that the first faces, the top ones,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
go out, well, let's say, to the people,

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
look at the reaction,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
look at how they react,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
how it is perceived,

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
and so that they, as it were,

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
from the first hands,

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
understand what and how it happens.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Well, the next, yes,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
the final commandments of brand management

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
are to concentrate the strength of the brand,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
that is, to concentrate the programs

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
on the most basic advantages,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
and always remember

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000
that a loyal consumer

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
is the most valuable asset of the brand.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Manage the brand

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
like any complex mechanism,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
it requires some kind of management,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
here you need to update in due time,

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
to carry out control,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
to make some changes,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
well, and constantly invest in the brand.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
This is what I have already said,

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
that the brand companies

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
in promoting the brand

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
cannot be considered as a one-time stock,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
let's say, well,

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
we will hold a campaign now,

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.000
and everything will be great.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Yes, from the point of view of positioning,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
yes, from the point of view of some,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
well, let's say,

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
pushing into the consciousness of the consumer

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
of a certain brand,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
there should be a powerful campaign,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
which should be held,

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000
but this does not mean in any case

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
that after that you can forget about everything

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
and let everything go to hell.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
As soon as you stop supporting

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
the promotion of the brand,

02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000
be sure that your competitors

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000
will not even play against you,

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
but just unwind their own brand

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
on similar goods,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.000
slowly push you away

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
in the consciousness of the end consumer,

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
and at some point he may be tense

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
and associate what was with your brand,

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.000
but no more,

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000
new competitors,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
they just hard

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
will be fixed in his consciousness

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000
and in his memory

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
as completely specific,

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
because they constantly remind themselves

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
about themselves,

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
and this is the most important thing.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Dear colleagues,

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
we have completed the review of our course

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
on the brand and its role

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
in improving the competitiveness of companies.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Let me remind you

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
that we started with you

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
to consider this course

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000
from the basic positions

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
of what advertising is

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
and its role in promoting the brand,

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
we considered some techniques

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
of psychology of advertising perception,

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000
some of its features

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
and how to implement

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
successful advertising campaigns.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
We considered with you

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
as if the most important thing

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
that the basis of the brand as such

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
is a trading mark and a trademark,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
and if you remember,

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I drew your attention

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
that this should be given

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
very much attention,

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
since this is the front

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
the only legal defense

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
protecting your company,

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
your product and your service.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I remind you again

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
that it is simply impossible

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.000
to protect your brand politically,

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000
so never forget this.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Further, we have considered

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
the main issues related

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
to the creative approach

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
in the advertising message of the brand.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000
We have considered the principles

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
of creating a creative approach,

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
forming techniques

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
that allow us

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
to swing our imagination.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
In particular,

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I drew your attention

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000
to the technology of branding

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
and the use of it.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Brainstorming and synaptic analysis,

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
some tricks,

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
pluses and minuses

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
of using humor in advertising,

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
testing of prepared

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
advertising messages of the brand.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I draw your attention

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
to the testing again.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
I have repeatedly in the framework

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
of our course

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
drew your attention

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
to the fact that

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
there are no absolute technologies,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
formulas, calculations,

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
but they are absolutely honest

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
and, to be honest,

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
all the conceivable techniques,

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
all the conceivable arguments

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
that could refute our approach,

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
our ideology, our concept,

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
were tested and taken into account.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Everything is certainly impossible to take into account.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
In conclusion,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
we have considered

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
the main mistakes of advertising companies

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
and methods of budgeting assessment

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
of not advertising companies,

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
but companies that are

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000
budgeting marketing communications

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
and analysis of their effectiveness,

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
the effectiveness of the complex

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
of the marketing communications

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
carried out

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
to promote the brand.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
They are certainly not perfect,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
as in advertising,

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
since everything is subjective here,

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
but nevertheless,

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
they still give you

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
a certain real idea

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
of what you have spent

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.000
and what you have received from it.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
And, in conclusion,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
we have considered

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
10 commandments of successful brand management.
