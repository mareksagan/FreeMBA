00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
Good afternoon, dear colleagues. Let's get acquainted. My name is Shulgina Elena Vladimirovna. I am a professor and

00:11.840 --> 00:15.920
a teacher at the Moscow School of Business, responsible for such topics as management and

00:15.920 --> 00:22.440
personnel. My business practice began in 1990 and since 1993 I have managed my own and

00:22.440 --> 00:28.440
other people's businesses. And during these 14 years I have worked in large companies,

00:28.440 --> 00:34.200
I am proud of many projects and the largest number of staff that I had to work with

00:34.200 --> 00:40.560
was a large Russian company with 50,000 people with distribution throughout the Russian region.

00:40.560 --> 00:46.080
Therefore, it seems to me that I know a lot about the staff, if not everything, well, or almost everything.

00:46.080 --> 00:56.440
As any head of a Russian business, if you ask us about what problems we

00:56.440 --> 01:02.680
face, or which of the resources is the most deficient for us, of course,

01:02.680 --> 01:08.400
any of us will say that these are personnel. As usual, personnel decide everything, and today personnel

01:08.400 --> 01:13.320
or human staff are really the main strategic resource of the company.

01:13.320 --> 01:20.040
In recent years, serious migration processes, serious demographic changes have taken place in Russia,

01:20.040 --> 01:26.320
which has led to significant deformations in the labor market. And we often have to look for

01:26.320 --> 01:31.440
specialists in completely unexpected places, or we cannot find specialists even for money.

01:31.440 --> 01:38.240
They say that the last century is a century of technology, and indeed, the emergence of the Internet and the

01:38.240 --> 01:43.320
opportunity to work with huge information flows have led to the fact that companies cannot

01:43.320 --> 01:48.960
actively compete now due to new technologies or new information.

01:48.960 --> 01:58.760
And the most interesting for us today are the opportunities of a company or the key competencies of a company,

01:58.760 --> 02:04.680
which allow it to respond more quickly to market requests, to more flexibly meet the

02:04.680 --> 02:15.760
client's requirements. And this depends on the speed of decision-making and the quality of the staff

02:15.760 --> 02:21.080
that does business for you, and which must achieve the business results that you set for them.

02:21.080 --> 02:29.680
Therefore, today we will talk about the role of the head of the staff management department,

02:29.680 --> 02:32.880
and in particular, on the topic of training and development of staff.

02:32.880 --> 02:41.240
The topic of human resources has recently gained strategic importance, but we know that as managers,

02:41.240 --> 02:46.880
we focus on human resources as on the resource that allows us to achieve business results.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.560
This is on the one hand. On the other hand, every person is an individual.

02:50.560 --> 02:56.040
Every person wants to develop, wants to implement some of their competencies, strategies,

02:56.040 --> 03:03.440
to receive new tasks, to improve their own levels. And any manager has to work with people

03:03.440 --> 03:09.920
and use both approaches. On the one hand, we must stimulate people to achieve business goals,

03:09.920 --> 03:15.720
to achieve our strategic goals. On the other hand, we must take into account their personal interests

03:15.720 --> 03:27.600
and self-realization. Therefore, when we manage staff, when we work with people and try to make them

03:27.600 --> 03:39.000
more effective, we also work on their personal development. Of course, there are such services

03:39.480 --> 03:47.600
as HR, but the main task of the staff service is to select the necessary specialists for you,

03:47.600 --> 03:53.920
to keep them, to create the necessary working conditions for them. But the topic of staff development,

03:53.920 --> 03:59.400
in my opinion, is the first thing that the head of the department should be concerned about.

03:59.400 --> 04:08.880
What new approaches exist in the practice of staff management today? We know the old approach,

04:09.280 --> 04:15.960
when the staff was perceived as staff, there were staff services, today staff services are already

04:15.960 --> 04:22.720
staff management services. Previously, expenses for staff were considered expenses,

04:22.720 --> 04:28.880
today expenses for staff are already investments. And if earlier shareholders or owners were not very

04:28.880 --> 04:34.440
interested in what was happening in staff services, then today both shareholders,

04:35.280 --> 04:42.120
and top managers are very actively involved in staff management. As a result of the survey,

04:42.120 --> 04:48.600
you can see now on the diagram that among the tasks that are before the staff service,

04:48.600 --> 04:57.960
one of the first tasks is the task of organizing training. We will talk about this. The training cycle

04:57.960 --> 05:04.120
includes 10 stages, they are now in front of you on the slide, and we will consider only

05:04.280 --> 05:10.760
5 main ones. These are items such as determining the needs in training, setting the goals of training,

05:10.760 --> 05:16.160
determining the subject content of the training courses themselves, choosing training participants and

05:16.160 --> 05:24.400
evaluating the training program. Before we talk about this, I would like to remind you that

05:24.400 --> 05:31.160
in the human resources management system there are such concepts as motivation and stimulation.

05:31.200 --> 05:36.840
What is the difference between motivation and stimulation? We know that motivation is what drives a person to work,

05:36.840 --> 05:42.200
this is why he is interested in performing certain tasks, and stimulation is those carrots or

05:42.200 --> 05:47.800
those stimuli that we provide him with in order for him to perform the work more effectively.

05:47.800 --> 05:53.520
In previous courses, you have already considered the main theories of motivation. We have

05:53.520 --> 05:58.160
substantive and procedural theories of motivation, you already know about this. And in the substantive theories of motivation,

05:58.160 --> 06:04.560
you have considered such theories as Maslow's theory, Herzberg's theory, for example. And now I propose

06:04.560 --> 06:10.680
you to complete one of the tasks from our work in a notebook in order to remember these theories.

06:10.680 --> 06:19.800
Try to determine what type of motivation is education related to, according to one or another theory.

06:19.800 --> 06:27.600
That is, what type of motivation we can refer to, or what level of motivation we can refer to such a type of education.

06:28.160 --> 06:37.160
How to determine the level of motivation?

06:37.160 --> 06:49.160
The next topic is the analysis of the needs in training staff.

06:49.160 --> 06:54.160
How can we determine how many people are needed and how we should train them?

06:54.160 --> 07:01.160
The approach is very simple. We determine what the situation is today, we model the situation that should be,

07:01.160 --> 07:11.160
and we determine what the difference is between them. That is, what is the difference between the target or planned level of knowledge and skills of employees

07:11.160 --> 07:15.160
and the basic level of knowledge and skills that exist now.

07:15.160 --> 07:20.160
The diagnosis of the needs in training includes four main stages.

07:20.160 --> 07:26.160
We must answer such important questions as why we train, who we train, what and how.

07:26.160 --> 07:30.160
Now we will briefly consider each of these questions.

07:30.160 --> 07:35.160
So, why do we train staff? What are the goals of training?

07:35.160 --> 07:39.160
Please look at the slide, I want to briefly comment on it.

07:39.160 --> 07:47.160
The goals of training must certainly coincide or be oriented towards the implementation of strategic tasks or achieving business results.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.160
It is good if the company has strategic goals formulated.

07:51.160 --> 07:56.160
Unfortunately, very often in Russian practice strategic goals are not clearly defined.

07:56.160 --> 08:04.160
Therefore, it is important to decide on the business goals of the organization for a period of one year or three years

08:04.160 --> 08:09.160
and to form training goals in accordance with these strategic goals.

08:09.160 --> 08:15.160
For example, very often companies set tasks such as increasing the share in the market,

08:15.160 --> 08:20.160
or the development of the sales geography, or increasing financial profitability,

08:20.160 --> 08:24.160
that is, increasing profits, increasing turnover, or increasing profitability.

08:24.160 --> 08:29.160
Under these strategic guidelines, a number of events are often planned.

08:29.160 --> 08:37.160
Therefore, the first thing to determine is what are the most priority events, goals and tasks are planned for the near future

08:37.160 --> 08:41.160
in order to determine the goals of training in connection with them.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.160
The next question is who do we train?

08:44.160 --> 08:52.160
There is a small table in front of you on the slide that illustrates the main groups of our specialists.

08:52.160 --> 08:58.160
These may be ordinary performers, professional industry specialists, managers and top managers.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.160
And, of course, the goals and tasks of training for each of the groups may be different,

09:02.160 --> 09:09.160
and you can evaluate this by looking at the comments presented in this table.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.160
The most important question is what to train for.

09:13.160 --> 09:19.160
The needs of certain skills or skills can also be presented in the table that is now on the slide.

09:19.160 --> 09:24.160
And we can divide the main types of training into three groups.

09:24.160 --> 09:29.160
The first is training that increases the qualification without any documents.

09:29.160 --> 09:34.160
It is considered to be training in the field of informal technologies.

09:34.160 --> 09:42.160
The second type of training is training that requires the confirmation of a qualification in the form of a certificate or a license for special certificates.

09:42.160 --> 09:51.160
These are more formalized technologies that are associated with a specific industry or functional specificity.

09:51.160 --> 09:57.160
The third type of training is training that is associated with the corporate requirements of the company itself,

09:57.160 --> 10:05.160
which helps to adapt to specialists more quickly and get used to the company and its rules.

10:05.160 --> 10:10.160
And the last question is how to train.

10:10.160 --> 10:18.160
The same groups of staff are shown on the slide as performers, specialists, managers and top managers.

10:18.160 --> 10:23.160
And we can understand that there is a short-term and long-term training,

10:23.160 --> 10:27.160
but there are also types of training that are divided into the main groups.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.160
These are training at work, training outside the workplace, but within the company,

10:31.160 --> 10:35.160
and training outside the company, which we will talk about later.

10:35.160 --> 10:40.160
So, once again, how should we orient training?

10:40.160 --> 10:42.160
How to determine the goals of training?

10:42.160 --> 10:49.160
Because this is the most important thing, because the goals of training should be oriented towards strategic business goals of the company.

10:49.160 --> 10:55.160
So, there are two main approaches that we can recommend for analyzing the needs of training.

10:55.160 --> 11:02.160
The first approach is the need for training that is associated with the strategic goals of the company.

11:02.160 --> 11:09.160
And the second approach is when we build training in accordance with the main requirements of the competence of the employees,

11:09.160 --> 11:12.160
that is, in accordance with the portraits of competence.

11:12.160 --> 11:18.160
Here are two approaches.

11:18.160 --> 11:23.160
The first option is to determine the goals of management.

11:23.160 --> 11:30.160
These can be goals described in the format of Management by Object, that is, the management system by goals.

11:30.160 --> 11:35.160
And when we have certain criteria for their achievement, we can check the intermediate results

11:35.160 --> 11:42.160
and assess the results of the work of the employee over the course of a year, and, accordingly, take certain actions to achieve the results.

11:42.160 --> 11:48.160
And, in particular, one of the actions is to plan his training and development, which will help him to achieve these goals more effectively.

11:48.160 --> 11:53.160
The second block is the determination of the competence of the employee in accordance with the description of the position.

11:53.160 --> 11:58.160
We also assess his knowledge and behavior, and, based on the results of the assessment of competence,

11:58.160 --> 12:04.160
we also take some adjustment actions, including planning training and development.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.160
Let's take a closer look at both approaches.

12:09.160 --> 12:16.160
The first approach is to determine the needs of training of the employees in accordance with the strategic goals of the company.

12:17.160 --> 12:24.160
Here I would like to touch on the topic of the life cycle of the organization.

12:24.160 --> 12:30.160
You will discuss this topic in the courses a little later.

12:30.160 --> 12:36.160
But the main idea is that any organization as a body is born, develops and can die.

12:36.160 --> 12:43.160
So, in order for the company not to die, it still experiences a number of so-called age crises,

12:44.160 --> 12:51.160
and it is assumed that at every stage of entering the market or the development of the organization, it pursues certain goals.

12:51.160 --> 12:56.160
For example, when the company creates, its main task is simply to enter the market,

12:56.160 --> 13:01.160
then, when it has won its share in the market, its task is to develop its business in terms of product, customer, and territory.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.160
Then it begins to expand, and the company's goals change.

13:10.160 --> 13:15.160
Of course, the goals of training the staff will depend on the organization's life cycle.

13:25.160 --> 13:30.160
Let's take a closer look at both approaches.

13:30.160 --> 13:35.160
So, how to determine the needs of training in accordance with the goals of the company's development?

13:35.160 --> 13:41.160
The main idea is that any organization as a body is born, develops and can die.

13:41.160 --> 13:47.160
So, in order for the company not to die, it still experiences a number of so-called age crises,

13:47.160 --> 13:53.160
and it is assumed that at every stage of entering the market or the development of the organization, it pursues certain goals.

13:53.160 --> 13:59.160
Of course, when we talk about the life cycle of the organization, we mean the life cycle of the company.

14:00.160 --> 14:06.160
Of course, when we enter the market, our main goal is to get a share in the market, to win certain positions.

14:11.160 --> 14:17.160
Then we want to expand, to win either territory or to develop a product.

14:17.160 --> 14:22.160
We begin to develop product or customer portfolios, and so on.

14:22.160 --> 14:27.160
In accordance with this, at every stage of the organization's development, the organization pursues several different goals.

14:27.160 --> 14:33.160
At every stage, we need to determine and bring the training goals into accordance.

14:33.160 --> 14:39.160
Let's look at the training goals of a company that implements a strategy of concentrated growth.

14:41.160 --> 14:47.160
A strategy of concentrated growth is usually characterized by the development of a business in several directions.

14:47.160 --> 14:51.160
The first direction is the product, the second direction is the client,

14:51.160 --> 14:55.160
the third direction is the territory, which is very often associated with geographic distribution.

14:55.160 --> 14:59.160
Usually, a company is interested in some financial result.

14:59.160 --> 15:05.160
Let's consider this as an example of an elementary financial result, such as an increase in profits.

15:05.160 --> 15:11.160
If we look at the goal of a company that is associated with an increase in the share in the market,

15:11.160 --> 15:17.160
namely, the presence in the client sector and the development of the product line,

15:17.160 --> 15:23.160
we can look at it from the point of view of the ratio of the product ratio.

15:23.160 --> 15:29.160
We have products. We have old and new products that we plan to introduce into the market.

15:29.160 --> 15:35.160
We have old and new clients, which we already have and which we are working with, and new ones that we want to attract.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.160
So, we are now selling the old product to the old clients.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.160
What do we want to do next?

15:41.160 --> 15:45.160
Next, we want to create a new product and offer it to the clients.

15:45.160 --> 15:51.160
Of course, we offer a new product to the old clients first, and then we will only offer it to the new clients.

15:52.160 --> 16:00.160
Or, if we are focusing on the development of client bases, then we offer the old products to the new clients.

16:00.160 --> 16:06.160
And only at the next stage do we offer new products to new clients.

16:06.160 --> 16:17.160
According to this table, it is clear that you will focus on the development of product-client relations.

16:17.160 --> 16:25.160
It is clear that there is practically no need to teach here, because old products are already sold to old clients.

16:25.160 --> 16:32.160
First of all, we will focus on training our employees on new products.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.160
How is this training done?

16:34.160 --> 16:38.160
As a rule, early in the morning, or at 8 a.m. or at 9 a.m., all employees are invited.

16:38.160 --> 16:43.160
Our brand managers or marketers tell us that we have a new product,

16:43.160 --> 16:52.160
or some new product that needs to be studied in terms of new characteristics or competitive features.

16:52.160 --> 17:03.160
In this logic, one of the first tasks is to increase sales by introducing new products.

17:03.160 --> 17:15.160
The goal of increasing the share on the market is transformed into tasks such as increasing sales by introducing new products and new client networks.

17:15.160 --> 17:22.160
Accordingly, you will teach new products and a system of searching for new clients.

17:22.160 --> 17:28.160
Further, the development of the share on the market can also take place due to the territory.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.160
There are many territories in the Russian Federation, 89 regions.

17:31.160 --> 17:36.160
It is clear that all regions will not be covered by their sales.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.160
Accordingly, you need to choose priority regions.

17:38.160 --> 17:43.160
To do this, you need to understand which region to go to first, where to invest money,

17:43.160 --> 17:50.160
in the development of which region will be the first investments, where to open branches or where to hire trade representatives.

17:50.160 --> 17:57.160
Therefore, in addition to training our managers on new products and new clients,

17:57.160 --> 18:05.160
we may also have managers in the development of territories or trade representatives on the territory, who also need to be trained.

18:05.160 --> 18:13.160
Such a strategic goal as increasing the share on the market can be implemented in the following way.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.160
Please look at the slide.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.160
The goal of the company is to increase the share on the market.

18:18.160 --> 18:24.160
Accordingly, the goals of the training are to increase sales and to develop the regional retail network.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.160
What groups of employees should we train?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.160
This is a sales and marketing department.

18:29.160 --> 18:35.160
If you have a branch company, then this department is trained both in the managing company and in the regions.

18:35.160 --> 18:46.160
Sometimes, even your representatives of clients or partners, your dealers or distributors, are included in such training.

18:46.160 --> 18:51.160
What training topics should be implemented?

18:51.160 --> 18:54.160
The first is training on new products.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.160
The second is training on the methods of customer base development.

18:57.160 --> 19:01.160
The third is training on the methods of searching and attracting new clients.

19:01.160 --> 19:05.160
The fourth is training on the technologies of regional retail networks.

19:05.160 --> 19:12.160
The fifth is training on the compliance regulations of all our documents, accounting, software, and possible credit policy.

19:12.160 --> 19:18.160
And the training forms, which are usually used in these types.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.160
Of course, training on the products is carried out through internal training.

19:22.160 --> 19:32.160
Such training as training on the technologies of compliance, as well as the documentation requirements, is internal training.

19:32.160 --> 19:39.160
Everything else, as a rule, is trained with the help of external providers or coaches or consultants.

19:39.160 --> 19:46.160
This is training on the methods of customer base development, attracting new clients, or creating home regional networks.

19:47.160 --> 19:52.160
If we look at the next task, the task of increasing profits.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.160
Let's recall the profit formula.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.160
The profit formula is very simple.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.160
Income minus expense.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.160
How is income formed in a company?

20:02.160 --> 20:08.160
This is the price of a product multiplied by the volume of the product.

20:08.160 --> 20:14.160
Well, we usually refer to expenses as all the costs that are formed in the process of implementing business tasks.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.160
In order to increase our profits, what should we do?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.160
The formula is very simple.

20:19.160 --> 20:26.160
Either we should increase the price, which is not always possible, but we should increase the volume of sales or reduce the costs.

20:26.160 --> 20:33.160
As a rule, managers form a task for themselves in all three areas.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.160
The first task is to optimize price formation.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.160
The second task is to increase sales volumes.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.160
And the third task is to work with costs.

20:43.160 --> 20:49.160
To draw up the goals and training for the main strategic goal of increasing profits,

20:49.160 --> 20:53.160
which we will teach, what and how,

20:53.160 --> 20:57.160
I suggest you try to write it down in our next task in the workbook,

20:57.160 --> 21:01.160
focusing on the model that I have already given you.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.160
So, the second approach to increase sales volume.

21:04.160 --> 21:10.160
The second approach to determine the needs in training is related to the portrait of competence.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.160
The topic of competence appeared in the US in 1970.

21:14.160 --> 21:18.160
The American Association of Managers developed a portrait of competence,

21:18.160 --> 21:23.160
which described the basic professional skills and skills that an employee should have.

21:23.160 --> 21:27.160
At the same time, in the UK, about the same time,

21:27.160 --> 21:31.160
the US government began to develop a portrait of competence,

21:31.160 --> 21:34.160
which was focused on functionality,

21:34.160 --> 21:38.160
that is, it described the functional responsibilities of employees.

21:38.160 --> 21:42.160
As a result, a general model of approach to competence was created,

21:42.160 --> 21:47.160
which is a description of both the functional features of the work of employees

21:47.160 --> 21:51.160
or requirements for employees, as well as professional skills and skills.

21:51.160 --> 21:55.160
From a single concept of what competence is today,

21:56.160 --> 22:00.160
no, they are different, the formulations are different,

22:00.160 --> 22:05.160
let's agree that under competence we will understand those professional skills

22:05.160 --> 22:11.160
that allow an employee to be the most successful in his or her functional activities.

22:11.160 --> 22:17.160
If you look at the slide, we can briefly say that competence is a combination of skills,

22:17.160 --> 22:21.160
knowledge and requirements for an employee.

22:22.160 --> 22:26.160
But it is known that people are selected for knowledge, and fired for behavior.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.160
Why do we need competence?

22:29.160 --> 22:35.160
Competence allows us to assess our employees at the entrance to the company,

22:35.160 --> 22:40.160
to understand what knowledge and skills are missing,

22:40.160 --> 22:44.160
and to develop certain training programs.

22:45.160 --> 22:50.160
To form a list of programs or a portfolio of programs for this employee

22:50.160 --> 22:55.160
and assess the effectiveness, that is, whether these training programs gave the result we expect.

22:55.160 --> 23:00.160
In addition, competence allows us to set a certain coordinate system

23:00.160 --> 23:05.160
and be the basis for selecting, assessing and developing employees.

23:06.160 --> 23:10.160
I would like to draw your attention to the slide again.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.160
What do we measure and develop?

23:13.160 --> 23:17.160
We have functional and professional competencies,

23:17.160 --> 23:21.160
corporate competencies that relate to a specific company,

23:21.160 --> 23:24.160
and management competencies.

23:24.160 --> 23:29.160
Please remember that two important words in the field of competence

23:29.160 --> 23:32.160
are the words that are used in the company,

23:32.160 --> 23:37.160
and the words that are used in the field of competence are the words that we measure and develop.

23:37.160 --> 23:40.160
That is, any competence should be described in such a way

23:40.160 --> 23:43.160
that it is clear how it can be measured,

23:43.160 --> 23:46.160
and secondly, so that it is clear how it can be developed.

23:46.160 --> 23:50.160
When we describe functional or professional competencies,

23:50.160 --> 23:55.160
it is easier to describe the functions that this employee should perform.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.160
When we describe corporate competencies, it is also not very difficult,

23:59.160 --> 24:03.160
because corporate competencies are usually industry competencies

24:03.160 --> 24:06.160
or competencies related to the features of the company's work.

24:06.160 --> 24:10.160
But those competencies that are usually related to management,

24:10.160 --> 24:13.160
communication, business and personality are those competencies

24:13.160 --> 24:16.160
that are difficult to measure and develop,

24:16.160 --> 24:21.160
but we need to develop these competencies in our employees as well.

24:21.160 --> 24:26.160
The next slide shows an example of describing competencies at several levels.

24:26.160 --> 24:30.160
Any competence is usually distinguished by five levels.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.160
These are the level of incompetence, the level of limited competence,

24:33.160 --> 24:36.160
the level of basic competence, the level of high competence and the level of skill.

24:36.160 --> 24:41.160
Your textbooks provide several examples of describing competencies.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.160
How can we assess competencies?

24:45.160 --> 24:49.160
The slide shows a graph.

24:49.160 --> 24:55.160
The blue one is a profile of the positions that meet the requirements of competence,

24:55.160 --> 25:01.160
and the yellow one is a profile of competencies that our specialist has based on the assessment.

25:01.160 --> 25:07.160
We see that some competencies are not quite up to the ideal profile,

25:07.160 --> 25:13.160
some are equal, and some are beyond the requirements.

25:13.160 --> 25:18.160
What should we do in this case?

25:19.160 --> 25:24.160
When our competencies are not enough,

25:24.160 --> 25:29.160
and this should be the basis for the development of training programs,

25:29.160 --> 25:34.160
try to answer the question,

25:34.160 --> 25:39.160
what should we do if our competencies are excessive,

25:39.160 --> 25:44.160
if our specialist has a little more than his position?

25:44.160 --> 25:49.160
Of course, we can promote him in the service,

25:49.160 --> 25:54.160
promote him in the position, if there is such an opportunity.

25:54.160 --> 25:59.160
Sometimes we can offer him to become a mentor or a teacher

25:59.160 --> 26:04.160
who can help us to form educational programs.

26:04.160 --> 26:09.160
We can load him more, so that we know that a person who knows more or knows more

26:09.160 --> 26:13.160
can do more work.

26:13.160 --> 26:18.160
So, don't touch him if he doesn't care.

26:18.160 --> 26:23.160
You know that he has a certain set of competencies that exceeds this position.

26:23.160 --> 26:28.160
You can use it now or a little later, but you don't have to focus on it.

26:28.160 --> 26:33.160
What methods are there to determine the requirements in training,

26:33.160 --> 26:36.160
usually in Russian companies?

26:36.160 --> 26:41.160
Of course, the first one is a person who came to us, we evaluated him, tested him,

26:41.160 --> 26:46.160
we know that he has a certain lack of knowledge or skills

26:46.160 --> 26:51.160
with the initial acceptance, initial testing.

26:51.160 --> 26:56.160
The next assessment of competence can be carried out by analyzing the results of work

26:56.160 --> 27:01.160
during the training period or when he is appointed.

27:01.160 --> 27:06.160
We can see how he acts during this time and understand

27:06.160 --> 27:11.160
how he will develop.

27:11.160 --> 27:16.160
Also, the basis for educational programs can be the results of the test of employees

27:16.160 --> 27:21.160
if you conduct a test.

27:21.160 --> 27:26.160
I can also offer you a form of evaluating the employees and their managers.

27:26.160 --> 27:31.160
Yes, of course, this is a subjective assessment,

27:31.160 --> 27:36.160
but on the other hand, it is these managers who interact with these people

27:36.160 --> 27:41.160
or we work with all the employees we have to.

27:41.160 --> 27:46.160
Therefore, we see each other every day and we understand that we lack certain skills.

27:46.160 --> 27:51.160
Therefore, the evaluation or interview of both the specialists and their managers

27:51.160 --> 27:56.160
is also one of the ways to identify the requirements in training.

27:56.160 --> 28:01.160
The second way is to analyze some special information.

28:01.160 --> 28:06.160
Perhaps a new technology has appeared in your industry,

28:06.160 --> 28:11.160
perhaps there are some changes in the labor market,

28:11.160 --> 28:16.160
and then it is possible that you will need to develop programs,

28:16.160 --> 28:21.160
training related to the specificity of your industry or your market.

28:21.160 --> 28:26.160
The third way is to analyze the management of the company.

28:26.160 --> 28:31.160
This is a process of management, which is implemented by the owners or top managers.

28:31.160 --> 28:36.160
There was such a story in one of my management practices

28:36.160 --> 28:41.160
when the owner of the company decided to leave the general director,

28:41.160 --> 28:46.160
change the entire composition of the top managers and leave the entire line staff.

28:46.160 --> 28:51.160
What happens? The top managers are fired, a new team comes,

28:51.160 --> 28:56.160
these are 8 people from a completely different structure,

28:56.160 --> 29:01.160
but this is the team that comes, they worked before, they come with their requirements,

29:01.160 --> 29:06.160
come with their regulations, work with management habits,

29:06.160 --> 29:11.160
and begin to introduce these requirements, regulations and habits into the standards of management of this company.

29:11.160 --> 29:16.160
You understand perfectly well that there is a conflict with the general director and with the line staff,

29:16.160 --> 29:21.160
and it is primarily associated with the management skills and competencies that this new team imposes on them.

29:21.160 --> 29:26.160
So, once again, please remember the important thing about competence.

29:26.160 --> 29:31.160
Two main words are measured and developed.

29:31.160 --> 29:36.160
Therefore, when you describe competence or make a portrait of competence,

29:36.160 --> 29:41.160
please do not use such words as a good employee,

29:41.160 --> 29:46.160
a decent person, or ability to develop,

29:46.160 --> 29:51.160
or ability to organize, or creativity.

29:51.160 --> 29:56.160
It is very difficult to measure such competencies, and, accordingly, it is not clear through which programs to develop.

29:56.160 --> 30:01.160
Once again, please do not use in the descriptions of competence those competencies that cannot be formulated,

30:01.160 --> 30:06.160
or those that require additional formulations or additional explanations.

30:06.160 --> 30:11.160
The assessment of competencies can be carried out by assessing the expected competencies

30:11.160 --> 30:16.160
and the existing competencies, and then by assessing the basic competencies.

30:16.160 --> 30:21.160
Here is a diagram of the assessment of competencies.

30:21.160 --> 30:26.160
The assessment of competencies is carried out in connection with the assessment of the basic competencies,

30:26.160 --> 30:31.160
the five levels of the ABCDE,

30:31.160 --> 30:36.160
and the competence profile highlighted in blue,

30:36.160 --> 30:41.160
which is desirable for this position,

30:41.160 --> 30:46.160
and the competence profile highlighted in yellow,

30:46.160 --> 30:51.160
which is identified by the employee.

30:51.160 --> 30:56.160
The assessment of competencies is not enough,

30:56.160 --> 31:01.160
and this can be the basis for the formation of training and development programs.

31:01.160 --> 31:06.160
Some competencies coincide with the requirements,

31:06.160 --> 31:11.160
and you see that there are a number of competencies that exceed the requirements for a position.

31:11.160 --> 31:16.160
What to do in this case if the competencies exceed the requirements for a position?

31:16.160 --> 31:21.160
There are also management competencies,

31:21.160 --> 31:26.160
but this is not always possible, and it is not always possible to develop a person's career.

31:26.160 --> 31:31.160
In this case, we can form a horizontal career for him,

31:31.160 --> 31:36.160
when he can gain additional key professional competencies.

31:36.160 --> 31:41.160
We can make him a mentor in those competencies in which he is strong.

31:41.160 --> 31:46.160
As a manager, you can know that you have a person with such wonderful competencies

31:46.160 --> 31:51.160
and use it in the future.

31:51.160 --> 31:56.160
How can we identify the needs for training?

31:56.160 --> 32:01.160
In addition to the main tools and assessments that we can use

32:01.160 --> 32:06.160
when accepting for work, when passing the probationary period

32:06.160 --> 32:11.160
or when adapting to the results of the attestation,

32:11.160 --> 32:16.160
in addition to official assessment procedures or semi-official assessment procedures,

32:16.160 --> 32:21.160
we can use some unofficial procedures.

32:21.160 --> 32:26.160
These are procedures such as interviewing or appointing employees or their managers.

32:26.160 --> 32:31.160
Both the employee and the manager can assess the competencies of their employees.

32:31.160 --> 32:36.160
Of course, these are controversial things, subjective assessments,

32:36.160 --> 32:41.160
but on the other hand, these employees and managers interact with each other

32:41.160 --> 32:46.160
and are able to assess what skills and competencies they lack.

32:46.160 --> 32:51.160
Another way to identify the needs for training is to analyze special information,

32:51.160 --> 32:56.160
either external information or special information.

32:56.160 --> 33:01.160
This information can be related to the introduction of new technologies or development of new technologies.

33:01.160 --> 33:06.160
One example is the 1S program.

33:06.160 --> 33:11.160
When it was introduced, not all companies sought to train their employees.

33:11.160 --> 33:16.160
Today, almost all specialists in finance or accounting

33:16.160 --> 33:21.160
undergo training similar to the 1S program.

33:21.160 --> 33:26.160
Another way to identify the needs for training is to analyze

33:26.160 --> 33:31.160
what kind of personnel changes may occur in the company

33:31.160 --> 33:36.160
or what special actions of the management will be taken.

33:36.160 --> 33:41.160
I would like to give one example from the practice of business from life.

33:41.160 --> 33:46.160
The owner, analyzing the actions of the group or the team of top managers,

33:46.160 --> 33:51.160
comes to the conclusion that this team is not effective and decides to replace the team completely.

33:51.160 --> 33:56.160
At the same time, the general director, whom he trusts very much, remains,

33:56.160 --> 34:01.160
the team of top managers changes, and all the line staff remains.

34:01.160 --> 34:06.160
The team of new top managers comes from another company.

34:06.160 --> 34:11.160
They are prepared, they are already organized, the teams come, they have already worked together

34:11.160 --> 34:16.160
and they are ready to start a new business.

34:16.160 --> 34:21.160
The new team begins to implement or broadcast these techniques of management

34:21.160 --> 34:26.160
or these regulations and habits, which, accordingly, causes a huge conflict.

34:26.160 --> 34:31.160
The conflict is both between the team of top managers and the general director,

34:31.160 --> 34:36.160
and the conflict with the line staff.

34:36.160 --> 34:41.160
We have a task to train the staff according to the requirements of the new team of top managers.

34:41.160 --> 34:46.160
You understand that in this case the training program is quite wide,

34:46.160 --> 34:51.160
on the other hand, it is very specific, because it should meet not only the requirements of the business

34:51.160 --> 34:56.160
or the requirements for the purpose of the business or the assessment of competence,

34:56.160 --> 35:01.160
but also the tasks, techniques or standards that this new team of top managers sets.

35:01.160 --> 35:06.160
And, of course, another way to identify the requirements for training

35:06.160 --> 35:11.160
is to listen to the analysis of the results of the organization's activities for a certain period.

35:11.160 --> 35:16.160
That is, if you planned or planned certain results,

35:16.160 --> 35:21.160
and the fact showed that we did not achieve them,

35:21.160 --> 35:26.160
then, of course, you need to understand why, due to the lack of any professional training,

35:26.160 --> 35:31.160
this occurs.

35:31.160 --> 35:36.160
That's all about competence.

35:36.160 --> 35:41.160
You can read more about it in our textbook and in other sections of the course.

35:41.160 --> 35:46.160
In this section, I suggest you to complete one of the small tasks

35:46.160 --> 35:51.160
that are proposed in your workbook.

35:56.160 --> 36:01.160
The next section we will discuss is the training of the staff.

36:01.160 --> 36:06.160
There are several basic forms of training that we will discuss today.

36:06.160 --> 36:11.160
I have already briefly touched on such forms as training at work,

36:11.160 --> 36:16.160
training outside of work,

36:16.160 --> 36:21.160
and it is divided into training outside of work, training at home,

36:21.160 --> 36:26.160
training at work, training outside of work,

36:26.160 --> 36:31.160
and it is divided into training outside of work within the company,

36:31.160 --> 36:36.160
that is, a person leaves the workplace but remains within the company,

36:36.160 --> 36:41.160
or it is training outside of the company.

36:41.160 --> 36:46.160
There is also such a topic as training throughout life,

36:46.160 --> 36:51.160
which is a corporate university.

36:51.160 --> 36:56.160
We have such terms as training, development, education, learning,

36:56.160 --> 37:01.160
and specialists very often use the term they like best.

37:01.160 --> 37:06.160
What is the interaction or development of these terms?

37:06.160 --> 37:11.160
Training, in our understanding, is a training event

37:11.160 --> 37:16.160
that forms certain tactical skills of our specialists.

37:16.160 --> 37:21.160
Development can include training programs

37:21.160 --> 37:26.160
that are focused on strategic development.

37:26.160 --> 37:31.160
The term education is even wider than training and development

37:31.160 --> 37:36.160
and can include other forms, such as academic education.

37:37.160 --> 37:42.160
The result of all these actions, training, development, and education,

37:42.160 --> 37:47.160
or the meaning of all these actions, is learning.

37:47.160 --> 37:52.160
Learning is a behavioral change or behavioral reaction of our professionals or specialists,

37:52.160 --> 37:57.160
and therefore the term learning is wider.

37:57.160 --> 38:02.160
We will use all these terms, but you should understand

38:02.160 --> 38:07.160
that learning is a way to create certain skills and knowledge

38:07.160 --> 38:12.160
that are applied in the practical work of our specialists.

38:12.160 --> 38:17.160
There are two most famous models in the theory of learning.

38:17.160 --> 38:22.160
This is the Alan Manford model, which divides learning into three types.

38:22.160 --> 38:27.160
This is informal learning, integrated learning, and formal learning.

38:27.160 --> 38:32.160
Informal learning is the random processes that our employee is involved in.

38:32.160 --> 38:37.160
Integrated learning is the work process that promotes learning.

38:37.160 --> 38:42.160
Formal learning is planned learning.

38:42.160 --> 38:47.160
It is common knowledge that we learn best from our own experience and practice.

38:47.160 --> 38:52.160
Using this idea, one of the founders of the theory of learning, David Kolb,

38:52.160 --> 38:57.160
created a cycle of learning stages.

38:57.160 --> 39:02.160
It was called the David Kolb cycle, which means learning based on personal experience.

39:02.160 --> 39:07.160
You can see in the diagram that these cycles are interconnected.

39:07.160 --> 39:12.160
We get personal experience, then we reflect it on our actions,

39:12.160 --> 39:17.160
we analyze it, and we experiment with it.

39:17.160 --> 39:22.160
Then we get our personal experience again.

39:22.160 --> 39:27.160
Very often, the David Kolb cycle is used in learning methods.

39:27.160 --> 39:32.160
For example, in training or seminar classes,

39:32.160 --> 39:37.160
we often use the following training exercises.

39:37.160 --> 39:42.160
You have some personal experience.

39:42.160 --> 39:47.160
You have to reflect on the skills or stereotypes of your management methods.

39:47.160 --> 39:52.160
After we analyze how you act,

39:52.160 --> 39:57.160
we analyze your actions and offer you new approaches

39:57.160 --> 40:02.160
or solutions to these or those tasks.

40:02.160 --> 40:07.160
In order to try or gain new experience in using new methods,

40:07.160 --> 40:12.160
we offer cases, role-playing games, and you participate in them.

40:12.160 --> 40:17.160
This is an experiment.

40:17.160 --> 40:22.160
If it goes well, you understand that there are other ways, and they are also effective.

40:22.160 --> 40:27.160
You can use the results of this experiment in your personal experience.

40:27.160 --> 40:32.160
Then, Alan Mumford suggested that each employee prefers a particular type of training.

40:32.160 --> 40:37.160
The types of employees can be divided according to the elements of the Kolb cycle.

40:42.160 --> 40:47.160
In short, we wrote about each type of employee on the slide.

40:47.160 --> 40:52.160
Types of employees in accordance with the main components of the Kolb cycle.

40:52.160 --> 40:57.160
An active employee who prefers to act.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.160
A reflector who likes to analyze his own experience.

41:00.160 --> 41:05.160
A theorist who likes to discuss theoretical approaches.

41:05.160 --> 41:10.160
A pragmatist who plans, studies, and checks theories.

41:10.160 --> 41:15.160
Of course, for most employees, the characteristics of these types and the development and training of the staff should be taken into account.

41:15.160 --> 41:20.160
Nevertheless, Mumford insists that some type of employee is present in a more obvious form.

41:30.160 --> 41:35.160
There are different types of employees and different training technologies.

41:35.160 --> 41:40.160
Today, the list of possible training technologies is so wide that we can choose almost any.

41:40.160 --> 41:45.160
Also, the types of training are presented in your workbook and on the slide.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.160
These are both individual and group training.

41:50.160 --> 41:55.160
All of them are listed in your workbook and described in detail,

41:55.160 --> 42:00.160
which technology is used for this or that type of training.

42:00.160 --> 42:05.160
If we develop the idea that we have different types of managers

42:05.160 --> 42:10.160
who are more familiar with a particular training format,

42:10.160 --> 42:15.160
and there are different training forms,

42:15.160 --> 42:20.160
it is clear that we can combine and assume that each type of manager or training type can correspond to a training form.

42:20.160 --> 42:25.160
This is a summary table, which is also presented in your workbook.

42:25.160 --> 42:30.160
You can see which training type is more suitable for each type of manager.

42:30.160 --> 42:35.160
Despite the wealth of Western experience and the wealth of choices,

42:35.160 --> 42:40.160
only a few basic types of training are used in Russian companies.

42:40.160 --> 42:45.160
However, we have presented you the entire range of training types used by Russian companies.

42:45.160 --> 42:50.160
You can also find them in your workbook.

42:50.160 --> 42:55.160
I would like to comment on only two of them.

42:55.160 --> 43:00.160
I think they may raise questions.

43:00.160 --> 43:05.160
The first type of training is training of other employees.

43:05.160 --> 43:10.160
How do we apply it?

43:10.160 --> 43:15.160
It would be great if a group of employees went to a training course

43:15.160 --> 43:20.160
and made a short presentation about the results of the training.

43:20.160 --> 43:25.160
They could share their knowledge with their colleagues.

43:25.160 --> 43:30.160
It is often inappropriate to share knowledge among Russian management companies.

43:30.160 --> 43:35.160
It is also inappropriate to make a request for knowledge.

43:35.160 --> 43:40.160
If a manager goes to a training course,

43:40.160 --> 43:45.160
he may not even suspect that he will receive knowledge from his colleague in the next room.

43:45.160 --> 43:50.160
In order to avoid this, training of other employees can be implemented

43:50.160 --> 43:55.160
through the presentation of knowledge or skills that managers have.

43:55.160 --> 44:00.160
It can be done through systematic seminars or courses.

44:00.160 --> 44:05.160
The Russian management company was a popular topic at the time.

44:05.160 --> 44:10.160
In my practice, the management company had a similar story.

44:10.160 --> 44:15.160
A young Russian man came to Russia and studied in England.

44:15.160 --> 44:20.160
He received a range of knowledge that was not used in Russian companies at the time.

44:20.160 --> 44:25.160
Despite the fact that the young man was quite communicative and professional,

44:25.160 --> 44:30.160
he did not have the opportunity to fully integrate into the Russian management environment.

44:30.160 --> 44:35.160
We decided to ask our colleague to prepare a topic

44:35.160 --> 44:40.160
on project management and to tell it to other managers.

44:40.160 --> 44:45.160
He was very enthusiastic about this task

44:45.160 --> 44:50.160
and prepared an interesting presentation on project management.

44:50.160 --> 44:55.160
You know, in our companies, if someone speaks,

44:55.160 --> 45:00.160
all other employees want to discredit him.

45:00.160 --> 45:05.160
Naturally, our Russian managers began to ask him provocative questions.

45:05.160 --> 45:10.160
One of the provocative questions was,

45:10.160 --> 45:15.160
what project did you come up with and implement?

45:15.160 --> 45:20.160
His story was really funny.

45:20.160 --> 45:25.160
It turned out that he came from America to Russia on a motorcycle.

45:25.160 --> 45:30.160
He had a great motorcycle and he came up with a project to come from America to Russia on a motorcycle.

45:30.160 --> 45:35.160
When he began to tell about this project, how he was preparing,

45:35.160 --> 45:40.160
where he would stop, how much gasoline he needed and what route to take,

45:40.160 --> 45:45.160
how the police in Italy and in other countries were working,

45:45.160 --> 45:50.160
it involuntarily served as a barrier to the distance that arose.

45:50.160 --> 45:55.160
This is one of the examples.

45:55.160 --> 46:00.160
Another example or practice that I would like to recommend is a practice of division,

46:00.160 --> 46:05.160
when top managers or owners, together with top managers,

46:05.160 --> 46:10.160
go to strategic seminars or strategic sessions,

46:10.160 --> 46:15.160
which we hold.

46:15.160 --> 46:20.160
It turns out that it is impossible to take everyone,

46:20.160 --> 46:25.160
because the number of participants is limited,

46:25.160 --> 46:30.160
and the strategy of the company is usually more interested in the composition of employees.

46:30.160 --> 46:35.160
We recommend holding a mini-presentation of strategic session participants

46:35.160 --> 46:40.160
for all other employees in a week to tell what was there,

46:40.160 --> 46:45.160
what was the atmosphere, share some impressions, emotions,

46:45.160 --> 46:50.160
maybe games and photos.

46:50.160 --> 46:55.160
This allows you to form a wider information field for those knowledge

46:55.160 --> 47:00.160
and to make a few comments on such a practice as the practice of other employees.

47:00.160 --> 47:05.160
You will see there another type of training,

47:05.160 --> 47:10.160
which usually raises more questions in our seminars,

47:10.160 --> 47:15.160
what kind of training is this, as reading.

47:15.160 --> 47:20.160
Recently, there has been such a direction, it is called directed reading.

47:20.160 --> 47:25.160
In addition to reading, there are some new technologies.

47:25.160 --> 47:30.160
There is even such a thing as a library day.

47:30.160 --> 47:35.160
A person goes to a library or sits on the Internet and works on a special topic,

47:35.160 --> 47:40.160
the results of which are necessarily provided to their manager or to the person in front of whom he is reporting.

47:40.160 --> 47:45.160
This does not mean that he went to dig potatoes,

47:45.160 --> 47:50.160
but it is used in companies sometimes through the following methods.

47:50.160 --> 47:55.160
You can entrust any of your specialists,

47:55.160 --> 48:00.160
for example, a specialist in personnel, to prepare a kind of digest of the latest articles

48:00.160 --> 48:05.160
or some materials published, which are responding

48:05.160 --> 48:10.160
or correspond to a particular topic of management activity.

48:10.160 --> 48:15.160
You can also make a selection for the purpose of the system with balanced indicators,

48:15.160 --> 48:20.160
or new approaches to the management of enterprises or something from the management field.

48:20.160 --> 48:25.160
You can make such a selection or recommend a separate article to your employees,

48:25.160 --> 48:30.160
send a message and be sure to ask for feedback or their impressions of what they have read.

48:30.160 --> 48:35.160
This is also one of the methods of directed reading.

48:35.160 --> 48:40.160
Directed reading is a list of books recommended for reading,

48:40.160 --> 48:45.160
and a book or a textbook is recommended for reading for a month.

48:45.160 --> 48:50.160
A round table or a reading conference is created on the topic of this book,

48:50.160 --> 48:55.160
where participants share their opinions about what they have read.

48:55.160 --> 49:00.160
This is a fairly simple, inexpensive and operational type of training

49:00.160 --> 49:05.160
that we can use.

49:05.160 --> 49:10.160
As for Russian training methods or training types in Russian companies,

49:10.160 --> 49:15.160
in order to understand which methods we do not use,

49:15.160 --> 49:20.160
I suggest you do the following exercise in a workbook.

49:20.160 --> 49:25.160
This is to distribute the types of training methods,

49:25.160 --> 49:30.160
which are usually used by Russian companies,

49:30.160 --> 49:35.160
to the working class and non-working class.

49:35.160 --> 49:40.160
I hope this will help you identify areas or fields that you can use,

49:40.160 --> 49:45.160
or the types of training that you can use in your companies.

49:45.160 --> 49:50.160
The topic of training throughout life.

49:51.160 --> 49:56.160
The topic of training throughout life.

49:56.160 --> 50:01.160
At first it seems that a person starts learning from kindergarten.

50:01.160 --> 50:06.160
First we learn to tie laces, then we learn to write in a notebook,

50:06.160 --> 50:11.160
then we study physics and mathematics, then we go to the institute,

50:11.160 --> 50:16.160
then we improve our qualifications and we learn without end.

50:16.160 --> 50:21.160
The concept of the European Union was developed in the 1990s.

50:21.160 --> 50:26.160
The idea of uniting Europe arose.

50:26.160 --> 50:31.160
The absence of borders and the formation of a single European currency

50:31.160 --> 50:36.160
led to people moving from country to country.

50:36.160 --> 50:41.160
There were no restrictions.

50:42.160 --> 50:47.160
Therefore, labor resources began to be concentrated in certain countries.

50:47.160 --> 50:52.160
Programmers and lawyers began to move from country to country

50:52.160 --> 50:57.160
in search of the most profitable ways to improve their competencies.

50:57.160 --> 51:02.160
Europe, which is concerned with the same problem as Russia,

51:02.160 --> 51:07.160
that there is a problem with labor resources,

51:07.160 --> 51:12.160
and that people are a strategic resource,

51:12.160 --> 51:17.160
held a conference in Lisbon in 2000.

51:17.160 --> 51:22.160
It developed a concept of training throughout life.

51:22.160 --> 51:27.160
Within this concept,

51:27.160 --> 51:32.160
which is quite large,

51:32.160 --> 51:37.160
it is possible to understand what basic competencies were included

51:37.160 --> 51:42.160
in this concept from the point of view of European skills.

51:42.160 --> 51:47.160
If you want to work in Europe, you must have the following skills.

51:47.160 --> 51:52.160
They are presented to you on the slide.

51:52.160 --> 51:57.160
These are communication in the native language, foreign languages,

51:57.160 --> 52:02.160
social and civic competencies, innovation and entrepreneurship,

52:02.160 --> 52:07.160
and your abilities in the cultural sphere.

52:07.160 --> 52:12.160
These are the ten main competencies described in detail in the document.

52:12.160 --> 52:17.160
The sample is also in the working notebooks.

52:17.160 --> 52:22.160
Training throughout life is a new concept.

52:22.160 --> 52:27.160
I believe that the next decade should be a decade of implementation of this concept.

52:27.160 --> 52:32.160
I have already said that the deformation of labor markets

52:32.160 --> 52:37.160
led to the fact that many competencies,

52:37.160 --> 52:42.160
which used to be more of a state structure,

52:42.160 --> 52:47.160
in particular, educational competencies or education systems,

52:47.160 --> 52:52.160
have now become competencies of the enterprise itself,

52:52.160 --> 52:57.160
as well as the formation of corporate ideology.

52:57.160 --> 53:02.160
Many enterprises are forced to engage in system training on their own.

53:02.160 --> 53:07.160
This is not only the case in Russia.

53:07.160 --> 53:12.160
The system of internal corporate training has existed for a long time.

53:12.160 --> 53:17.160
The leading model is the model of an independent training organization.

53:17.160 --> 53:22.160
But the model of competences and the system model is usually used by Russian companies,

53:22.160 --> 53:27.160
while the leading model and the model of an independent training organization are usually used in the West.

53:27.160 --> 53:32.160
What forms of implementation in our companies usually exist in the system of corporate training?

53:32.160 --> 53:37.160
Such words as a corporate university,

53:38.160 --> 53:43.160
a corporate training center, a self-learning organization,

53:43.160 --> 53:48.160
have recently appeared in our terminology, and some concepts are confused.

53:48.160 --> 53:53.160
What is a corporate training center or a corporate university?

53:53.160 --> 53:58.160
Therefore, I would like to talk first about a certain corporate training system.

53:58.160 --> 54:03.160
What is a corporate training system?

54:04.160 --> 54:09.160
In order to create a corporate training system,

54:09.160 --> 54:14.160
there must be some prerequisites.

54:14.160 --> 54:19.160
Such prerequisites as restructuring of the company,

54:19.160 --> 54:24.160
possible changes in the business or new strategic directions,

54:24.160 --> 54:29.160
possible changes in the approach to business,

54:29.160 --> 54:34.160
and new requirements for managers and managers in terms of business changes,

54:34.160 --> 54:39.160
can also create prerequisites for forming a corporate training system.

54:39.160 --> 54:44.160
What other reasons can cause a corporate training system to emerge?

54:44.160 --> 54:49.160
The first is territorial separation.

54:49.160 --> 54:54.160
When you have an office in Moscow and a bunch of branches in the regions,

54:54.160 --> 54:59.160
you must have a task in front of you to manage the regions,

54:59.160 --> 55:04.160
to create formats or standards for proper service to the clients,

55:04.160 --> 55:09.160
to maintain the quality of goods and services,

55:09.160 --> 55:14.160
and to improve the quality of client service.

55:14.160 --> 55:19.160
The need to combine corporate knowledge between the main office and branches

55:19.160 --> 55:24.160
is one of the reasons for the formation of a corporate training system.

55:24.160 --> 55:29.160
The second reason is the development of the company's top management,

55:29.160 --> 55:34.160
the creation of a unity of knowledge in the corporation,

55:34.160 --> 55:39.160
the enhancement of the brand can occur through the corporate training system,

55:39.160 --> 55:44.160
and, of course, the improvement of the tool for motivating the team.

55:44.160 --> 55:49.160
In the slide you can see that our corporate training system consists of three elements.

55:49.160 --> 55:54.160
These are personal motivation, personal motivation,

55:54.160 --> 55:59.160
professional knowledge and skills, and strategic goals and tasks of the organization itself.

55:59.160 --> 56:04.160
The next slide illustrates how we can approach the formation of a corporate training system.

56:04.160 --> 56:09.160
The first element is the development of the company's top management,

56:09.160 --> 56:14.160
the second element is the development of the company's top management,

56:14.160 --> 56:19.160
and the third element is the development of the company's top management.

56:19.160 --> 56:24.160
We have two areas of competence, professional and technical competence and communication competence.

56:24.160 --> 56:29.160
The following graph shows that when an employee joins our organization,

56:29.160 --> 56:34.160
he must understand his functionality and the basic corporate communication,

56:34.160 --> 56:39.160
that is, a school of adaptation is selected.

56:39.160 --> 56:44.160
We must develop an adaptation program.

56:44.160 --> 56:49.160
If we develop an employee by professional competence and improve his professional qualification,

56:49.160 --> 56:54.160
such a school and programs associated with professional development arise.

56:54.160 --> 56:59.160
If we develop communication competence, then schools and programs associated with business relations will appear.

57:00.160 --> 57:05.160
We know that our leadership theory and management theory tell us that

57:05.160 --> 57:10.160
if our manager, specialist, is focused on both working with people and getting results,

57:10.160 --> 57:15.160
if our manager, specialist, is focused on both working with people and getting results,

57:15.160 --> 57:20.160
then he is one of the key or leading leaders.

57:20.160 --> 57:25.160
Then we create a school of leaders or programs that help us develop leadership skills.

57:26.160 --> 57:31.160
Often in a company you can use specialists who already exist,

57:31.160 --> 57:36.160
it is not necessary to use only coaches from external training companies or consultants.

57:36.160 --> 57:41.160
it is not necessary to use only coaches from external training companies or consultants.

57:41.160 --> 57:46.160
You can create a school of corporate coaches from the employees you have.

57:46.160 --> 57:51.160
So, we have five main schools that allow us to develop certain competencies,

57:51.160 --> 57:56.160
or to determine priorities in the development of competencies.

57:56.160 --> 58:01.160
Again, it is a school of adaptation, a school of professionals, a school of leadership,

58:01.160 --> 58:06.160
a school of business relations, a school of corporate coaches.

58:06.160 --> 58:11.160
Returning to the topic of corporate universities, training centers, separate training courses,

58:11.160 --> 58:16.160
how are they interconnected?

58:16.160 --> 58:21.160
There are different forms of training in the general system of corporate education.

58:21.160 --> 58:26.160
Separate seminars and trainings usually arise when you are just starting to form a system of education.

58:26.160 --> 58:31.160
A system of education.

58:31.160 --> 58:36.160
A system of education.

58:36.160 --> 58:41.160
What is the difference?

58:41.160 --> 58:46.160
We conducted a survey among employees and managers of various companies.

58:46.160 --> 58:51.160
What is the difference between a corporate training center and a corporate university?

58:51.160 --> 58:56.160
Our interviewees had a hard time answering.

58:56.160 --> 59:01.160
There were some comments about the presence of their own programs,

59:01.160 --> 59:06.160
or the presence of their own coaches,

59:06.160 --> 59:11.160
or the presence of their own programs,

59:11.160 --> 59:16.160
or the presence of their own coaches,

59:16.160 --> 59:21.160
but there was no clear understanding of the difference between a corporate training center and a corporate university.

59:21.160 --> 59:26.160
So, what is the difference between a corporate training center and a corporate university?

59:26.160 --> 59:31.160
A corporate training center is usually a structural unit of a company.

59:31.160 --> 59:36.160
The employees of the company can be accredited within the framework of this training center,

59:36.160 --> 59:41.160
have their own teachers and coaches.

59:41.160 --> 59:46.160
Training is aimed only at employees of the company,

59:46.160 --> 59:51.160
and educational licenses are not required.

59:51.160 --> 59:56.160
The corporate university is usually more extensive.

59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.160
It is a training center for its employees,

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.160
and it is more extensive.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.160
It is a training center for its employees,

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:16.160
and it is more extensive.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.160
The corporate university should support the main groups of the following processes.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.160
The corporate university should support the main groups of the following processes.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.160
The first is the exchange of knowledge and experience within the organization.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.160
The second is the exchange of knowledge and experience between organizations and partners,

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:41.160
and the third is the creation or unification of special knowledge,

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.160
taking into account the professional or industry specifics.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.160
The third is the creation of a business model for the purpose of the university,

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.160
as well as the process of achieving the results.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.160
As a rule, one of the goals is to increase customer satisfaction.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:06.160
In order to respond to the client's requests more flexibly

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.160
or to respond to market demands more quickly,

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.160
the third is to increase the efficiency of the company in general,

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.160
reduce costs, retain talented employees and increase turnover.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.160
These are the five main goals that are usually set before a corporate university.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:32.160
How to create a corporate university, how to evaluate its effectiveness more effectively,

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.160
and how to make it more effective?

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.160
You can watch the video on how to create a corporate university,

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.160
how to evaluate its effectiveness in more detail,

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.160
and answer the questions related to the corporate university in your workbook.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.160
The next slide shows the relationship between different forms of education

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:02.160
in the general corporate education system.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.160
As a rule, we start training employees through separate seminars and trainings.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.160
Then, the task of creating a training center is often raised.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.160
After the company has established its own training center,

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:22.160
we create a corporate university.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.160
There was a survey conducted between employees of large enterprises.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.160
The employees could not give a clear answer to the question

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.160
of what is the difference between a corporate training center and a corporate university.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.160
However, there were some differences.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.160
The main difference is that a corporate training center is a little smaller.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:52.160
It is usually part of the organizational structure,

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.160
is a structural unit of the company,

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.160
sometimes has certified programs or is accredited by the company,

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.160
attracts both its own and external coaches,

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:12.160
is aimed at training only employees of the company,

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.160
and does not require an educational license.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.160
The corporate university differs from a corporate training center

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.160
in that it has more functional tasks.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.160
We will see the difference in the next slides.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.160
I would like to tell you about the history of the corporate university.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.160
In fact, the corporate university is considered to be the offspring of Mickey Mouse.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.160
At one time, the company created a program called You Create Happiness.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.160
It was the first hour program aimed at training employees.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.160
The idea of the corporate university was picked up by McDonald's,

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.160
which created the so-called University of Hamburg.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:08.160
It was more of a professional school than a business school or a school of some other education.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.160
Nevertheless, it was called a university.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.160
If we talk about corporate universities in the modern sense,

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.160
what processes should be implemented or what tasks should be solved by a corporate university?

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.160
Look at the following slide.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:34.160
These are the processes that a corporate university should support.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.160
These are the exchange of knowledge and experience within the organization,

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.160
as well as the exchange of knowledge and experience between organizations and partners.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:49.160
This can be our suppliers and our clients.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:54.160
What is the individual or group plan of development of employees?

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:59.160
There is another concept in the topic of development of employees,

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:04.160
which is the individual or group plan of development of employees.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.160
What is it?

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:14.160
When you evaluate an employee at the entrance,

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.160
you can see the individual or group plan of development of employees.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:24.160
Based on what data can it be obtained and how is it formed?

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.160
What data can be used?

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:34.160
Let's look at the following slide.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.160
These are the results of the evaluation of this employee,

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.160
the evaluation of the competence and the development menu.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:49.160
What is the development menu?

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:54.160
The development menu describes five areas of development.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:59.160
These are development at work, search for feedback on your actions,

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.160
training, seminars and project special tasks.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.160
Often, employees are involved in the development of their individual plans.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:14.160
This motivates them to develop.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.160
This does not resist the implementation of such a plan.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.160
We said that competencies can be functional, professional and corporate.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.160
We also said that the most difficult competencies to develop

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:34.160
are those related to business, communication and leadership qualities.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:39.160
The most difficult competencies to develop are such as team spirit, openness or flexibility,

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.160
motivation to achieve or focus on the result,

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.160
ability to think creatively or have a creative approach,

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:54.160
responsibility for the assigned tasks and loyalty to the company.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.160
Any program you try to implement to develop these competencies

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.160
does not always bring the expected result.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.160
The ideal scenario is 2 to 3 programs.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:14.160
Try to make an individual development plan for yourself or your employee

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.160
based on the following logic.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.160
The goal of the project is to develop the company, the unit and the employee.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.160
The goal of the project is to develop the company, the unit and the employee.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:34.160
This is one of the tasks in our workbook.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.160
The training system for the staff.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:00.160
In this section, I would like to say that, as a rule,

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:05.160
when talking to the managers about how to better create a training system in the company,

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:10.160
they often ask the main five questions.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.160
First, where to start, what to do and how.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:20.160
Second, how the training process is organized,

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:25.160
what functions are performed, which units are responsible for the training.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.160
And third, how to evaluate the investment needed to create a training system.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.160
Let's try to answer all five questions and start with the first one.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.160
I will probably repeat myself a little bit here.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.160
First, it is important to understand at what stage of development the organization is,

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.160
in what form and volume of training it needs.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.160
Second, what type of training is preferred at this stage, external or internal.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:00.160
What process will take place, what is the internal corporate business process for training.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:05.160
And you need to measure the level of efficiency of both the programs themselves

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.160
and the systems that implement them.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.160
In the next slide, or rather, in the four slides and in your workbook,

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:20.160
a certain method of express-diagnostics of the training system is proposed,

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:25.160
which you have now or which you are planning to build.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.160
In our opinion, if you try to answer all the questions about this express-diagnostics honestly,

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:35.160
it will be easier for you to determine which system you are building,

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:40.160
which system exists and what is worth paying attention to.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.160
I will comment on only a few questions that, as a rule, arise from our listeners.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:50.160
Let's look at the first slide.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.160
I think you can easily describe the field of TV activities of the company,

01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.160
but the number of employees in the company is a very simple question.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.160
It does not make it more difficult if all the information in the company matches.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:10.160
What do I mean?

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.160
Very often, if we request a list of employees from the accounting department,

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:20.160
a list of employees from the personnel department and a list of employees from the secretary,

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.160
we get three different lists of employees.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:30.160
What is the difference between these lists?

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.160
We have an accounting list.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:40.160
These are people who receive a salary, work and receive a salary.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.160
But there may be employees who are not employed,

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:50.160
but they may not receive a salary.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:55.160
You can get a list of employees from the secretary,

01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:00.160
but on the other hand, there may be people who have already resigned or moved somewhere,

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.160
and he may also be wrong.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.160
We have already discussed the goals of the organization,

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.160
the goals of the system of training.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.160
Try to answer the question,

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.160
is there a formalized requirement for positions?

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.160
Do you have a job description?

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:35.160
Do you have a portrait of competence?

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.160
This will help you to diagnose the gap

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.160
between the basic and desired skills of the specialist.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:50.160
What are the causes of the problem?

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.160
Let's try to answer this question.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:00.160
Why is there such a difference between the experience and the skills that the employees have and what we expect from them?

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.160
What is the frequency of the training?

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.160
How often do you train the employees?

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.160
How do you calculate the number of training days per year?

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.160
Let's say one employee is trained 7 days a week,

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:25.160
and the second employee is not trained at all.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.160
The question is,

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.160
what criteria for calculating the number of training days per year on average

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.160
will you use to assess the results of the training?

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.160
The topic of the budget for training is also a separate issue.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:50.160
Is the budget for training being formed?

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.160
The next part of the questions is about the training form

01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:00.160
and the choice of coaches and providers.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:05.160
It would be good to assess what methods are used,

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.160
what are the signs of choosing external providers or coaches,

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:15.160
how do you use the technical materials,

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.160
what training is being conducted, and what documents and forms are being regulated.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.160
The fourth page of this diagnosis suggests that you assess the distribution of resources.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.160
If we look at the percentage of training days per employee,

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:35.160
we see that the administrative and technical staff take up the most training days,

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.160
and the top management takes up the least.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.160
This table is not an example,

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.160
it is just an example for reflection.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.160
Therefore, when you analyze the number of training days,

01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:00.160
compare them with the financial costs that you incurred.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.160
The second question is,

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.160
from which blocks and by what logic should we build a training system?

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:15.160
Let's think about what tasks we should implement

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.160
and, accordingly, with which blocks we can divide our training system.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.160
A person comes to work, we assess his or her knowledge of competencies,

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.160
what knowledge he or she lacks, we assess it according to the results of the training period,

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.160
and we develop it in the process of adaptation, and accordingly, a block of assessment of the staff arises.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.160
Then he or she started working, we understand that he or she needs to improve his or her qualification,

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.160
and a block of increasing the qualification of the staff arises.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:50.160
And such blocks as assessment, introduction to the position,

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.160
improvement of qualifications, and further improvement of qualifications and development of skills,

01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.160
are included in the training system.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.160
But since in order to train and develop the staff,

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.160
we need to assess each time at certain stages,

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:15.160
therefore, as a rule, the assessment and development block is included in one meaningful block,

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.160
adaptation training in the second, and improvement of qualifications in the third.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:25.160
So, the task of introducing a person to the position,

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.160
which includes getting acquainted with the company, its mission, its history,

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.160
introducing a person to the position of a unit in cooperation with other employees and units,

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.160
forming basic knowledge, skills, and skills,

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.160
the task of adapting employees, and the training of the training system.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.160
The task of increasing the qualification implies that we should assess the need for training,

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.160
develop individual development programs,

01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:00.160
and form a portfolio of training programs for each employee,

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:05.160
implement this training through special skills courses,

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:10.160
for example, some basic skills, radio-electronic or software,

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.160
and the next task is to assess the staff and development,

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:20.160
which implies modeling of the portfolio of competencies,

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.160
assessing the level of existing competencies,

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:30.160
developing competencies by target groups, and, if necessary, changing the category of employees.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.160
You can approach the training system and divide it into other blocks,

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.160
and then the training system will be more focused on the meaningful load in accordance with these blocks.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.160
Of course, any training system will be focused on various groups of specialists,

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.160
but you can make it key,

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:55.160
that is, approach the training system based on professional groups.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:17:00.160
Let's look at the next slide,

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.160
what emphasis can be made on the dependence of certain groups.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.160
Of course, our specialists and professional workers should get the maximum practice

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.160
through the training of special mentors, coaches,

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.160
or with the help of some information technologies.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.160
Such a group of specialists as young specialists is a new generation of our managers and managers.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:30.160
Unfortunately, many young specialists did not get the Soviet good experience of production or bureaucracy in the past,

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.160
and they often do not understand about production engineering or basic approaches to management.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.160
Therefore, our young specialists, especially managers, have to learn management skills.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.160
Engineering and technology specialists are not the only ones who are interested in this field.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.160
There are many other specialists,

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.160
but it's not easy to find the right trainer,

01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.160
technical industry specialist, engineer, designer.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.160
In fact, these are the most recognized professionals in the Waste Management sector of Russia.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:10.160
So, it is very hard to find suitable trainees.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:15.160
If these certain people are the specialists,

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.160
even if they are specialists, let's say, technologists or designers,

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:25.160
they often suffer from the fact that they do not own a car or some modern computer programs.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:30.160
And then, of course, these specialists need to be trained in a modern technical program.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:35.160
Linear managers are our middlemen.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:40.160
These are managers, let's say, sales directors or marketing directors or our financial services.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.160
It is known that in our companies there is often a local war.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:50.160
Salespeople always conflict with marketers or manufacturers

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.160
and they always unite against the accounting.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.160
Therefore, the programs aimed at this field of specialists

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.160
should be made so that salespeople understand the meaning of the work of marketers,

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.160
manufacturers should focus on the salespeople's performance, not on the warehouse.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.160
But, of course, everyone was careful with the requirements of accounting,

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.160
which are set in the company.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.160
The most difficult group of specialists is the managers,

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:30.160
because they require individual training,

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.160
and they need to be trained in a modern training system.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:40.160
This is a small pyramid with the distribution of programs and groups of staff,

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.160
and some emphasis on how to better orient this training depending on a particular group.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:50.160
The third question is how to build the training process.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:55.160
If you have a program that allows you to describe the business process

01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.160
in the standard of these description programs, then this is great.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:05.160
If not, then it is highly recommended to describe the business process

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:10.160
in squares, crosses, circles, at least on your knees,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.160
in order to understand which main blocks of such an organizational training process you implement.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:20.160
Again, a slide, some comments to it, to this picture.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:25.160
So, the training process is focused on the business goal,

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:30.160
and should help us answer the questions, what we want to achieve,

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:35.160
what operational results or financial consequences.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:40.160
Then we conduct an analysis of the training requirements in order to understand why we train them,

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:45.160
in what direction, what we expect, what changes.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:50.160
We determine what we teach, how we teach, through what forms and which groups of specialists we train.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.160
Then there is a section on implementation of these knowledge or skills.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:00.160
What knowledge and skills should our specialists apply at work,

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.160
and how we implement or control their implementation.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:10.160
Here I would like to say that, of course, we must be ready for any consequences of implementation,

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.160
because it is not always positive.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:20.160
And the last block in the training process is the assessment of the training.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.160
Have we achieved the results that our goals were oriented to,

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:30.160
that is, those operational, financial or other results,

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:35.160
for which we started all this training.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:40.160
The next question we should answer is how much it costs,

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:45.160
what will we do to create such a training system.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:50.160
Here I would like to make a comment that our training budget will consist of two parts.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.160
The first is the budget that you spent money on creating a training system,

01:21:55.160 --> 01:22:00.160
and specialists, possibly on a material and technical base,

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.160
on programs, on teachers, that is, on the training system itself.

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:10.160
And the second is the money or resources that you will spend on staff

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:15.160
in order to train him, to get the knowledge and skills that you want them to have.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:20.160
Therefore, it is customary to allocate the following types of training costs.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.160
Let's see in the next slide what types of training costs are the main ones.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:30.160
The first group is direct costs,

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:35.160
which relate to the payment of the work of teachers on the conduct of the classes,

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:40.160
and also the cost of multiplying the materials themselves.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:45.160
Very often we do not put this cost in the budget, this is wrong.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:50.160
You must necessarily lay down all the materials that you have to print, publish.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.160
The accompanying costs are the rent of the equipment,

01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:00.160
the cost of some consumables, the cost of the trip, accommodation, food,

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.160
and the teachers themselves, if your students went somewhere on a course from the region to Moscow,

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:10.160
or to a neighboring city, or if you brought the teachers to yourself.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:15.160
And indirect costs, which are usually rarely taken into account, because they are simply forgotten.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.160
In fact, think about it, when your employee is studying,

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:25.160
in addition to paying for his training, you also pay him a salary for the day when he is studying.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.160
And there is also such a concept as lost income.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.160
In addition to paying him a salary, he also did not bring income to the company.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.160
Therefore, as a rule, indirect costs include salaries of employees during training,

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:45.160
and salaries of employees in the workplace.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:50.160
How can we optimize the costs for training?

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:55.160
There are several basic approaches, several methods, I am sure you are familiar with them.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.160
Nevertheless, let's look at the following slide,

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:05.160
the direction of saving costs for training,

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:10.160
the first approach is to reduce the number of our employees participating in the trip,

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.160
because they are usually the most expensive.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.160
The second approach is to reduce the number of our employees participating in the trip,

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:25.160
because they are usually the most expensive.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:30.160
And it doesn't matter how many participants there are,

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.160
we try to put as many people as possible on this seminar,

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:40.160
regardless of the fact that the number of participants is 10 people,

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.160
we have 40 people at the seminar,

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:50.160
and we try to optimize the costs for training.

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.160
Still, the increase in the number of participants in closed seminars can be expanded,

01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.160
but we would like it to be within the acceptable limits.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.160
I can say as a teacher that when I expect 10-15 people and get into the audience for 40,

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:10.160
not always my programs involve 40 people.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.160
Naturally, we do not get the results that we could get in a more narrow format.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:20.160
The next approach is very common in Russian companies,

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.160
when we choose teachers through a training company,

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:30.160
and then we start looking for individual approaches to the teacher himself

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.160
so as not to pay the training company, but to pay the teacher himself.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:40.160
This is Russian practice, and it really saves costs for training.

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.160
I omit the ethical side of this issue.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:50.160
The next approach that allows us to optimize costs is when we copy materials

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.160
or adapt training events by the forces of internal teachers or by the forces of internal copying.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:00.160
For example, you invited a teacher and got permission to video his course,

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.160
and then this course is listened to by all new employees or new specialists who come.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.160
They can already listen to the same course,

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.160
but in video.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:20.160
It is possible that you invite a teacher to materials that you can later use

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:25.160
or copy in a wider or larger copy.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.160
Another approach that you can use is to create your own methodical materials

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.160
that can be developed with the help of external teachers,

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:40.160
but with the participation of your employees and specialists.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.160
Creating such internal training methods also saves a lot of costs for training.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:50.160
There is a lot to talk about in terms of training systems,

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.160
and there is a lot to tell.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:00.160
The format of interaction can be more extensive.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.160
Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize once again

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:10.160
that the first training is primarily based on the creation of the training system itself,

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.160
that is, people who will be engaged in training,

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.160
the formation of a material and technical complex or a training base,

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.160
possibly a training hall, a class or equipment.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.160
The creation of training programs is all that is included in the training system.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.160
And the training procedures themselves are aimed at re-qualifying your employees.

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.160
Pay special attention to this.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.160
The topic of corporate knowledge, knowledge management.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:50.160
I think you have also faced this problem when you trained a person

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.160
or you had a unique specialist, he leaves and it is impossible to find a second one,

01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:00.160
and you cannot pass on the knowledge, because he is either unique

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.160
or he did it in a special way.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.160
The most common situation is when a sales manager leaves and takes away the client base with him,

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.160
and the client is often competing with other organizations for himself.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.160
The way to maintain the methods of working with partners, with clients,

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.160
the interaction between them, very often leaves a person and we have lost the knowledge he had.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:30.160
You know perfectly well that there are situations when a specialist has left

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.160
and deleted all the information from the computer,

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:40.160
or he took something important with him and your corporate knowledge is no longer unique

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.160
Therefore, many companies are concerned about how to accumulate the knowledge that existed in the company,

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:50.160
how to systematize them, how to archive them, how to pack them,

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.160
and most importantly, how to pass it on, how to develop the company in this way,

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.160
or how to get additional competitive advantage for the company,

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.160
while preserving and developing the corporate knowledge that arises in the company itself.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:11.160
Recently, there is a new concept called Knowledge Management,

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.160
which is associated with the concept of continuous learning,

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:21.160
the learning organization, the corporate university, and so on.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:26.160
The concept of the learning organization itself arose in Japan,

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:31.160
but, as always, it got its application or its meaning in the world of knowledge management.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.160
The learning organization is usually distinguished by four basic models of knowledge creation.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:46.160
Look at the slide, it is quite simple.

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.160
These four basic models suggest the following way of knowledge creation.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:56.160
From informal to informal, that is, we have informal knowledge of one employee,

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.160
which he passes on to another directly, and this also results in informal knowledge.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:07.160
The second approach is from formalized to formalized.

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:12.160
When you pass on knowledge from an employee or unit through instructions or documents,

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:17.160
or create something new using the existing formalized knowledge.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.160
It can be documents, it can be instructions, it can be a description of technologies, or something else.

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:34.160
There is, of course, a form of passing knowledge from informal to formalized.

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.160
This is when a person realizes and formulates the basis of his hidden knowledge

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:44.160
and turns it into the knowledge of the whole team.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:49.160
Here I really like such an example, almost anecdotally,

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.160
when a grandson asks his grandfather,

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:59.160
and the grandfather could not sleep all night because he could not remember where he put his beard.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:04.160
So, the transfer from informal to formalized is when you do not remember how you put your beard,

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.160
but then you realize how to do it and describe where you need to put your beard before you go to bed.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:14.160
And the next and last form is when you pass knowledge from formal to informal.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.160
That is, employees, receiving formalized knowledge, expand it,

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:24.160
master it, actively use it, and perhaps they develop some other skills.

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:29.160
Let's say you have passed a technology or presented some kind of technology and work in the form of instructions,

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:34.160
and you perfectly understand that five employees use the instruction or technology

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:39.160
and can get different results using their individual approaches.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:44.160
And this will be the use of formalized knowledge for informal.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:49.160
It is possible that one of the employees will improve this technology

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:54.160
by using some additional skills or some other approach.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:59.160
The topic of self-learning organizations has recently become a fairly fashionable topic,

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:04.160
and they write a lot about it.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:09.160
If you are very interested in this topic,

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:14.160
you can find a lot of information about it both within our business school and outside it.

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.160
The next section is dedicated to assessing the effectiveness of learning.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:24.160
How to find out if the learning was effective, if it brought results?

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.160
This is probably what all the leaders are concerned about when conducting training.

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:34.160
It seems that our employees went to training, how to find out if it was effective.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:39.160
But this is not a new issue, we will not invent a bicycle.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.160
A famous specialist of the last century, Donald Kirkpatrick,

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:49.160
at the time, proposed a conceptual approach to assessing learning programs.

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:54.160
This approach has become a classic, almost indecent,

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.160
four-level model of assessment of learning.

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:04.160
Let's look at the slide.

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:09.160
First, you need to understand what contribution the training department makes

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:14.160
to the achievement of the goal of the organization.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.160
The assessment should show you, as a manager,

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:24.160
how to help the leader to make decisions.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.160
You should continue to stop a program or a training procedure

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:34.160
and get information on how to improve this program in the future.

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.160
So, the next slide shows four levels

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.160
on which you can make an assessment of the effectiveness of learning.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:49.160
The first level is the reaction of participants.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:54.160
Kirkpatrick calls it the assessment of customer satisfaction,

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.160
taking into account the participants' experience.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:04.160
As a rule, we immediately conduct a survey,

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.160
whether the students liked the material, whether the teacher liked it or not.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:14.160
All seminars end with a questionnaire.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:19.160
The question is whether the participants liked the material.

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.160
If the teacher does not bother the audience,

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:29.160
or tells jokes all day long,

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.160
the participants will like it.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:39.160
The second level is the training.

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:44.160
The assessment of the knowledge acquired.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.160
What knowledge has been acquired and whether it is used by a person at work.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.160
Of course, it is important to understand whether the person has studied well,

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:59.160
whether he spent money on it, whether he passed a course of study,

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.160
but it is important to understand what percentage of knowledge

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.160
is used by the person.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.160
The third level is the assessment of behavior change.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.160
This is especially true if the learning is aimed at changing behavioral reactions.

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.160
This is often the learning of sales skills,

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.160
leadership, time management, holding meetings, and so on.

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:34.160
The participants have passed the training,

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:39.160
they have done well in training or seminars,

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:44.160
and in a week they are acting as they did a month ago.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:49.160
It is important to understand how they use the new techniques

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:54.160
in their work after the seminar or training.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.160
The fourth level is the assessment of the financial or operational results of the training.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:04.160
This is one of the most famous approaches.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:09.160
Let's train our sales specialists,

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:14.160
and expect that after we have trained them,

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:19.160
sales should increase 2, 3, 4, 25 times.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:24.160
Of course, we would like to increase the sales,

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.160
but training does not always affect the sales.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.160
You can hold advertising and marketing promotions,

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:39.160
maybe you had promotions related to discounts, bonuses,

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.160
maybe the season factor influenced.

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:49.160
This is the fourth level of the Kirkpatrick model,

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:54.160
and it can also be assessed.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.160
The workbook suggests you to think about

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.160
how to assess the effectiveness of the training

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.160
in accordance with each level of this model.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:14.160
We have already discussed the reaction of participants through surveys.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.160
How do we check whether our listeners know or not

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:24.160
whether they have or do not have these skills,

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.160
whether they apply them or not,

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:34.160
and whether the training has influenced the financial or operational results.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.160
We have already discussed the classical model

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:44.160
of the Kirkpatrick assessment of the effectiveness of training.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:49.160
It is interesting to know whether this model is used in practice.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.160
We have already discussed the classical model

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.160
of the Kirkpatrick assessment of the effectiveness of training.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.160
But it is interesting to know

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:09.160
whether there are other approaches to assessing the effectiveness of training.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:14.160
Of course, there are.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.160
We said that the new approach to the staff

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.160
is based on the fact that we see the staff

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:29.160
as the financial directors and owners.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.160
Let's see what our internal investors,

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.160
financial directors and owners know about the results.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:44.160
How can we assess the results of the financial or return on investment

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.160
in the staff according to the results of the training or development program.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:54.160
You can see that the internal investor

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:59.160
can guess the results of the development program.

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:04.160
Top managers sincerely believe

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:09.160
that the training and development of the staff is great,

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.160
but they cannot always prove that the training and development program

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:19.160
is effective.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.160
In general, if we talk about the approach

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.160
to the key indicators of efficiency,

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:34.160
it is difficult to develop a universal indicator of efficiency

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.160
for the training and development program,

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:44.160
but it is possible to develop a universal indicator of efficiency

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.160
for the training and development program.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:54.160
There are several procedures used to assess the effectiveness of training and development.

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:59.160
The following are the methods used in the West.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:04.160
The slide shows the main methods used.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:09.160
Since it is not always possible to determine the direct effect of the training,

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:14.160
especially on the operational results,

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.160
then experts assess how much the training has influenced

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:24.160
the increase in sales volume or increase in turnover or increase in profit.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.160
The second main method is the Jacob Phillips method,

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:34.160
which is used to assess the return on investment.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:39.160
This method is used,

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:44.160
but it has become very similar to another method,

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:49.160
which is the assessment of the return on investment.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.160
There is also a benchmarking method.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:59.160
The word bench is a bench,

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.160
and the approach to benchmarking is related to the fact

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.160
that we assess ourselves with our neighbors sitting on the same bench.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:14.160
When we study the best practices,

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:19.160
or the best experience,

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:24.160
we can see that the value of human resources is assessed as the value of any resource.

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.160
There is a purchase value, a purchase value,

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.160
a recovery value and a balance value.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:39.160
But as a rule, they are assessed within the framework of the assessment of non-material assets of the company,

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.160
and a number of approaches are used.

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:49.160
How is it done in Russia?

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:54.160
What training indicators are usually used by Russian companies?

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.160
Let's look at the table on the next slide.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:04.160
We have three groups of criteria by which we can assess the effectiveness of training.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.160
The first group is the group of quantitative indicators,

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:14.160
which is the group of indicators that we can assess the number of employees we have trained,

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.160
or the number of hours we have spent training one employee.

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:24.160
There are financial indicators,

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.160
which are the income, the wage fund,

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:34.160
or the expenses for each training course or for one participant.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:39.160
When we assess the quality of the training,

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:44.160
we can do it through the certification assessment,

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:49.160
the average personnel assessment index,

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:54.160
or through the quantitative indicators of the trained employees to the total number of employees in the company,

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:59.160
or in each category of personnel.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:04.160
Therefore, each assessment of effectiveness in the field of training and development

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:09.160
is a kind of agreement on standards, indicators, and their constant improvement.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:14.160
Returning to the topic of the assessment of the investment in the personnel,

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.160
can the ROE indicator be applied to training programs?

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.160
In general, if we talk about an indicator such as ROE,

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:29.160
then the return on investment in personnel can be calculated.

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:34.160
But can this indicator be used for training programs?

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.160
It can be used in any case,

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:44.160
if the programs are long enough,

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:49.160
for example, if the programs run throughout the year.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.160
The ROE indicator has its advantages and disadvantages.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:59.160
It allows to give a certain number of results,

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.160
to assess the financial consequences.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:09.160
But the difficulty of using this indicator is that there should be a certain duration of the program

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:14.160
so that this indicator can be calculated.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:19.160
The ROE formula is very simple.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:24.160
It is the increase in income minus the expense,

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:29.160
divided by the expense and multiplied by 100%.

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:34.160
In your workbook there will be a task for calculating the ROE.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:39.160
I think you can easily handle it.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:44.160
I would like to make a short comment on the benchmarking methodology,

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:49.160
when we compare ourselves with the best examples of domestic or foreign practice.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:54.160
The slide shows the indicators in Russian and foreign companies.

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:59.160
For example, the percentage of the budget spent on training in Russian companies

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.160
is 6-20%, and in Western companies it is 35-50%.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:09.160
If we look at the spending on training

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:14.160
in relation to the ROE,

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.160
I ask our listeners what percentage,

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:24.160
what budget for training and the ROE budget,

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:29.160
in the best case it is 1-2%,

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:34.160
and in foreign companies it is 4%.

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:39.160
For example, in the company Mary Kay it is 18%.

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:44.160
Russian companies spend very little on training,

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.160
although the spending on training has increased.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:54.160
The ROE is 400-600 dollars per year per employee.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:59.160
The spending on training in Western companies has increased to 2,000 dollars per year per employee.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.160
The number of days spent on training is used as an indicator.

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.160
In Russian companies, the best case is a week,

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.160
which we can deduct from the production cycle.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:19.160
In Western companies, many people train their staff

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:24.160
for almost three months,

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.160
that is, 72-75 days.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:34.160
The number of employees with individual development plans

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:39.160
in Western companies is almost 23%.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:44.160
According to our statistics, there are no such employees yet,

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.160
but this is due to the fact that individual development plans are being created.

01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:54.160
The number of employees who are trained with coaching is one of the training technologies.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:59.160
Unfortunately, I have not yet met such a mass circulation of coaches in Russia.

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.160
As a rule, it is top-level, owners use it,

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:09.160
and not as often as they would like.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:14.160
The ROE is very widespread,

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:19.160
almost 81% of employees are trained in this way.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:24.160
If we want to compare such an indicator as the ROE with others,

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:29.160
I can say that the most successful companies

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:34.160
show a fairly high percentage of return on investment,

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:39.160
that is, ROE from 1.3 to 1.6.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:44.160
This is a serious investment, a serious return on investment,

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.160
but it must be able to calculate and evaluate.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:54.160
I would also like to make a small comment

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.160
on how the participants themselves assess the effectiveness of training.

01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.160
We have interested parties who are involved in this process.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:09.160
Who are these interested parties?

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:14.160
Of course, the SMED manager himself, the financial director, the owner,

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.160
and perhaps the top is the one who signs our training budgets.

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:24.160
How does he assess the results of training?

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:29.160
On the other hand, he has his own opinion

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:34.160
on how the knowledge or skills of employees have changed.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:39.160
The next participant in the process is the customer,

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:44.160
as a rule, our director or head of the department.

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.160
He forms his opinion on the effectiveness of training

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:54.160
and the performance of his employees.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.160
One of the main participants in the process is the listener himself,

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:04.160
the specialist we train.

01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:09.160
His subjective opinion is assessed.

01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:14.160
Did he like the topic?

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:19.160
The teacher is also an interested party.

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.160
If before we were afraid of teachers and their assessments,

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:29.160
now teachers have stopped making assessments.

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:34.160
I would like to remind you that you should use the opportunity

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.160
to evaluate the listener, evaluate their work in the audience,

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:44.160
their knowledge.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.160
Unfortunately, many teachers and coaches have ceased to use this tool.

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:54.160
We evaluate many listeners, especially if it is a long-term program.

01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:59.160
We can see how the listener behaved during the entire training program.

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:04.160
Very often we use a scoring system in long-term programs.

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.160
Despite the fact that this is not a formal approach,

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:14.160
we do not put it as a stimulating factor.

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:19.160
The one who studied the best will receive a prize.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.160
However, comparing yourself with other participants in the process

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:29.160
often stimulates our listeners.

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:34.160
The assessment of effectiveness of the training program

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:39.160
is based on the subjective opinion of all participants.

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.160
It is very easy to do.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.160
You can do it by a survey or by an interview with participants.

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:54.160
This will help you get additional impressions

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:59.160
and to get the result you expect from the training and development of employees.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:04.160
We have discussed the topic of training and development of staff

01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:09.160
in the main sections.

01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:14.160
We have discussed how to assess the need for training,

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:19.160
what methods and forms of training can be used,

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:24.160
how to invest in the training and development of employees,

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:29.160
how to build the process,

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:34.160
and what modern methods and approaches exist in this area.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.160
The examples I gave and the tools I gave you

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:44.160
were used in a number of Russian companies,

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:49.160
and they exist and work.

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:54.160
I would be very pleased if you acquire new ideas

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:59.160
and apply them in your companies.

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:04.160
These methods are not regulated, certified or licensed.

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:09.160
If you can implement something in practice,

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:14.160
it will be great.

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:19.160
We wish you success in your new endeavors.
