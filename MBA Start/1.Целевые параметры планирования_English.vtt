00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.220
My name is Elena Nikolaevna Stanislavik.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.940
I read courses in enterprise

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.640
economics, financial management,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.100
investment design at the Graduate

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.480
School of Economics, the Academy

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.340
of Business Administration,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.080
as well as in the training

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.120
system of professional

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.520
accountants of anti-crisis

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.800
managers within the MBA

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.160
program.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.300
I actively engage in investment

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.380
consulting as an expert.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.000
I work in the project finance

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.860
management of Intrastbank.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.320
Today we will discuss with you the principles

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.720
of financial planning.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.920
The importance and relevance of this

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.640
topic today in the epoch

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.420
of financial scandals, I do not doubt.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.240
You want to learn how the actions

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.060
of financial managers can reduce to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.240
zero the enterprise's achievements

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.620
in production, sales markets, in provision

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.000
or, vice versa, how to create money

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.380
from the air, skillfully managing

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.260
the turnover of assets, profitability,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.280
optimizing the value of capital,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.140
using the effects of leverage

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.700
and other professional

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.400
secrets.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.460
Your business lacks money, there is profit

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.840
in the reporting, and the account

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.860
is empty.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.860
These are the problems that are addressed

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.460
by financial planning.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.200
Financial planning is interesting,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.380
useful and necessary.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.240
Our video course, designed for executives

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.760
and managers, is designed

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.020
to instill sustainable planning

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.480
skills, including forecasting

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.040
the components of cash flows

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.080
and estimating expected

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.580
financial outcomes.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.100
The course is aimed at solving

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.740
emerging problems in business.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.600
The methodology of training implies

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.140
that the students are already

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.720
familiar with the basic terms of financial

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.800
management or can refer to the votary

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.440
and recommended literature.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.220
During the lectures, I use

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.520
the term “enterprise” most often,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.780
considering it the most general

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.260
and thus emphasizing

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.280
the entrepreneurial component

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.920
of any company, firm, corporation,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.420
organization or financial

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.160
institution.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.480
The lecture consists of 10 blocks.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.340
I hope that by formulating target

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.640
parameters, statistical and tactical

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.800
tasks, we can place the emphasis

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.820
and highlight the red thread

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.260
of planning processes.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.480
During the presentation of the theoretical

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.240
foundations of financial planning,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.940
examples from practice, logical

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.140
schemes, graphs will be given.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.540
The approximate ratio of theory

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.940
to practice will be 10.5 minutes

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.380
per training block.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.340
For independent work, you use

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.160
an electronic textbook, which contains

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.280
text of lectures and a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.920
workbook with tasks.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.100
Please complete the task after listening

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.000
to each block of the video courses.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.220
First of all, I ask you to present

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.780
your business as an open system,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.860
linked to other enterprises

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.620
in the procurement and sales markets

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.980
by the movement of goods, the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.340
flow of goods.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.840
Flows of goods determine the main functions

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.080
of the enterprise – provision, manufacture

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.540
of goods or provision of services

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.460
and sales.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.940
For the movement of goods, counter-

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.180
cash flows, cash flow, cash

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.660
flows, cash flows are

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.340
necessary.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.660
Money flows also link enterprises

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.620
with the state and the capital

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.100
market.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.280
Thus, enterprises in financial

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.500
management represent

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.940
as a subject of financial

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.900
relations surrounded by the financial

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.580
sphere.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.680
Input and output cash

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.760
flows, we will call cash

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.100
flows or receipts and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.320
outflows or payments.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.820
I ask you, looking at this scheme

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.780
of financial flows, try to formulate

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.920
the financial goal, financial outcome,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.220
financial conditions of the company'

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.280
s prosperity, conditions of enrichment

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.100
or conditions of growth

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.980
of business value.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.380
The answer to “profit” is not quite

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.560
correct, I will explain by example.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.800
Suppose the company's revenue for

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.080
a certain period amounted to 1000

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.000
monetary units, current costs - 800

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.560
monetary units, including the amortization

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.400
clearance of 100 monetary

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.960
units.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.760
Then the balance sheet profit

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.420
of the enterprise is 200 monetary units,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.860
the income tax at the rate of 24% - 48

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.380
monetary units, and the enterprise

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.760
account will remain 162 units of

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.240
net profit and 100 monetary units

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.580
of amortization clearances.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.700
These indicators in the reporting

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.720
appeared with one accounting

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.840
policy variant.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.780
But if we use another accounting

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.780
policy and apply, for example,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.960
accelerated depreciation by doubling

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.400
the depreciation clearance,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.280
then we see that despite the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.380
fact that the profit in the reporting

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.040
decreases, but the tax on profit

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.120
decreases, therefore, the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.500
account of the enterprise

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.280
as a financial result,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.800
results in a large amount.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.220
The financial purpose of the division

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.920
and the task of financial planning

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.900
is to coordinate the flow of financial

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.080
resources and outflows or to

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.240
provide liquidity in a broad sense.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.240
Accordingly, financial

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.940
result, net cash flow or

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.340
net cash income is net cash

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.440
flow in translation.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.200
The difference between these indicators

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.180
profit and net monetary income is based

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.140
on the division of the concept of

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.000
results, revenues, receipts and expenses,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.840
expenses, payments.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.900
Income and payments, flow and

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.180
outflow are the main objects

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.820
of financial planning.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.060
Profit and cash flow are different

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.060
analyses, interrelated but not duplicating

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.960
parameters.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.020
So, profit in the reporting does not

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.940
always mean the presence of money on

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.300
the account in the business pocket.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.220
For example, Walmart, ahead

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.720
of its maximum growth

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.400
in the 70s and 80s, had a

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.380
constant negative free

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.780
cash flow.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.820
Sam Walton opened the new

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.960
branch at such a rate that current

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.020
turnover was lacking for financing,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.500
but the profitability in the new

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.520
retail houses was on average 25%,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.900
which was much higher than the company's

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.800
weighted average capital price.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.260
Thus, the negative net cash

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.120
flow was actually hidden

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.300
success.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.340
The company's shareholder return at

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.520
that time was the highest in the world,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.640
and Sam Walton became the richest

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.420
man in America.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.720
The value added

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.200
to the Walmart network

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.740
rose from $30 million

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.560
in the 1980s to $528

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.840
million in 1990.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.860
So, we have clarified the salt

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.480
of activity in light of the concept

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.640
of cash flows and we can say that

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.620
to increase the value of a business,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.380
you need to know exactly when

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.000
and how much money will be needed

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.460
to perform the assigned

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.460
tasks, when and how much

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.340
will be received.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.860
That is what financial

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.880
planning is doing.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.880
Planning is a part of the management

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.920
process in the company.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.800
This is conscious anticipation

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.960
of actions, comparison of different development

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.120
options, determination of goals,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.840
ways and conditions for achieving

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.120
goals, modeling of results of activities,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.380
search for favorable opportunities

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.460
to create conditions for

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.600
tomorrow.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.800
Strategic planning begins

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.540
with the question of what we

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.340
want to and where we are.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.620
This catalog of requirements and gives

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.520
the answer to the question what

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.400
we want to, with key parameters for

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.140
tactical development.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.800
Accordingly, financial planning

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.280
can be considered as the process

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.980
of setting strategic

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.580
parameters of activity

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.500
and control of their implementation.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.480


00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.140
Today, in the conditions

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.220
of uncertainty, instability of the situation,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.600
it is necessary to review the planned

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.080
tasks, to clarify the level of indicators

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.120
and normatives, which is the

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.180
essence of monitoring.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.080
Today, two control and monitoring

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.480
units are in the first

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.740
place.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.080
Financial planning is an integral

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.080
part of the overall planning process

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.100
in the enterprise.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.960
Financial planning uses information

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.900
of the marketing plan, the

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.580
production plan, the mission

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.000
and the overall strategy.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.100
The main tool of planning

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.440
is analysis.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.580
In financial planning, respectively,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.460
use the results of financial

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.560
analysis, analysis of

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.540
data of accounting reports.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.850
The scheme of cash flow planning

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.790
considered in the previous block

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.750
allows a new look at the

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.470
place of the financial block in

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.750
the system of balanced indicators.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.250
This is not some isolated area,

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.370
finance is imposed on all operational

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.790
processes.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.530
Financial planning permeates,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.130
links into a single link

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.670
marketing, personnel and

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.610
production planning.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.630
The essence of financial planning is

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.970
that we need to calculate all the

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.750
components of the flow and outflow

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.470
of the financial asset, to

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.130
estimate the cash flow.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.050
Financial planning takes into account

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.670
external and internal parameters.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.690
External parameters include the volume

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.370
of demand and supply of goods, prices

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.190
of products and resources, the system

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.470
of settlements between suppliers

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.150
and consumers, credit

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.910
terms, the procedure

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.130
for taxation and other factors.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.450
Internal planning parameters, such

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.410
as business scale, determine

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.010
the production capacity and,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.710
accordingly, the quantity

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.190
of products produced and services

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.690
provided.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.690
The level of technology of the organization

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.630
of operational processes determines

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.050
the cost and prices of products.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.610
The level of management is expressed in

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.550
the effectiveness of business activity.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.050
Planning types can be divided

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.670
by different classification

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.530
features into operational,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.710
current and forecasting.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.370
According to the time horizon of

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.230
planning, respectively, they

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.190
are short-term, medium-term and

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.070
can be divided by different signs

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.910
of classification into operational,

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.710
current and forecasting.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.410
Accordingly, these types of

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.990
planning differ in different degrees

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.410
of flexibility.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.910
Operational planning is carried

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.230
out by the lower management,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.710
current middle management and

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.570
strategic planning is carried

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.610
out by the senior management.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.930
As we have said, planning is

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.330
inseparable from controlling,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.030
so every type of planning

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.870
involves establishing

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.810
certain indicators.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.870
Forecasting establishes general

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.910
strategic parameters, such

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.530
as the market value of the

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.510
enterprise, capital structure,

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.630
weighted average value

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.790
of capital, economic

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.190
added value.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.450
Current planning based on these

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.690
strategic indicators calculates

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.450
financial coefficients.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.630
Finally, the maximum

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.050
detail is made in operational

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.330
planning, when individual indicators

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.290
are established, understandable

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.150
on any lower control

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.030
link.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.350
According to the content of planning,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.570
for example, planning the creation

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.530
of a new enterprise, or planning the

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.410
development, expansion of the business

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.010
of the existing enterprise.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.310
According to the directions of planning,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.250
the technique of polarisation can

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.910
be distinguished, distinguished, there

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.010
are forms of planning from top to bottom,

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.050
from bottom to top or counter-planning.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.480
Thus, we and Valma tried

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.240
to link together the problem of

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.620
business value growth and such

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.800
control parameters as capital

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.540
price, target capital structure

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.320
and financing rules.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.720
The essence of financial planning

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.960
consists in calculating

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.100
all components of the flow and

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.320
outflow of funds.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.260
Therefore, internal and external conditions

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.280
must be taken into account.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.740
External planning parameters include,

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.380
as you can see on the slide, the

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.420
volume of demand and supply of goods,

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.660
prices for products and services,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.780
the system of settlements between

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.560
enterprises, the terms

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.680
of lending, the procedure for taxation.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.360
Internal planning parameters are

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.960
primarily the scale of the business,

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.220
which determines the

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.980
production capacity and

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.320
the quantity of goods or services

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.760
produced.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.340
The level of technology and organization

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.020
of production processes determine

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.580
the cost and prices of goods.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.020
The level of management determines

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.800
the performance of the performance indicators.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.040
These external and internal

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.960
parameters affect the income

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.080
and expenses of the enterprise,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.680
the cash flow and outflows.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.680
Planning is pushed back and leads

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.360
to a certain set, a systematized

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.180
set of key parameters

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.060
of activity, to the planned

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.040
indicators.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.220
In general, we can say that financial

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.160
planning is a process, and a

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.340
financial plan is a set of documents,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.300
on the basis of which the planned

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.140
financial indicators

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.380
of activity are calculated.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.800
Types of financial planning

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.980
are divided into three

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.920
main groups: forecasting,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.500
current planning and

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.220
operational planning,

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.200
respectively, which differ

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.820
by the horizon of planning.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.260
Long-term perspective is forecasting,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.360
medium-term is engaged

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.620
in planning and operational

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.320
is limited to a

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.720
short-term period.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.180
The degree of detail for each type

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.740
of planning is its own,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.400
the most amplified indicators are

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.120
inherent in strategic planning.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.240
Current planning more detailed

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.200
calculates the performance indicators,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.720
and the maximum detail

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.000
is inherent in operational planning.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.020
In addition to these features, current

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.400
operational and forward-looking

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.740
planning differ in the volume and completeness

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.600
of information, flexibility.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.860
Different levels of management

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.000
are involved in different types of planning.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.700
Operational planning is the lower

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.440
management, current planning is

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.080
carried out by the middle management,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.320
and strategic parameters determine

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.240
the top management.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.720
Indicators that are

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.340
established during planning

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.300
as a result of planning,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:10.740
according to the results of

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.020
forecasting include the market value

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.920
of the enterprise, the structure

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.440
of capital, added value.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.320
Current financial planning leads

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.020
to a certain set of financial

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.020
coefficients.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.620
Operational planning clarifies

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.140
and identifies individual

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.680
activity indicators, such as the

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.040
financial cycle, which we will

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.580
consider in the next blocks.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.960
In terms of planning, we can

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.900
talk about planning an

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.940
existing enterprise, about

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.440
planning its development, or

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.140
we create a new enterprise,

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.320
develop investment projects.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.410
Planning techniques can be from

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.610
top to bottom, from bottom to top,

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.530
or more often use mixed counterplanning.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.990
The distinction between long-term and

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.590
short-term planning, as you can see,

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.550
implies not only different planning

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.410
horizons, but also different composition

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.790
of target parameters.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.750
Strategic financial decisions about

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.630
investments, financing, mergers

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.690
and acquisitions are controlled

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.130
by economic value added,

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.170
by the target structure of capital,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.490
by the weighted average

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.750
value of capital, and

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.150
the tactic is to ensure

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.330
financial balance.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.410
Particular attention in planning should

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.070
be paid to the compliance of financial

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.930
and management parameters of

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.710
activity, as the financial sphere

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.270
of the enterprise is inseparably

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.670
connected with the production

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.470
sphere, with the operational

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.110
processes, with the real

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.030
processes of exchange.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.410
And financial indicators do not exist

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.450
on their own, but depend on management

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.150
decisions in the field of

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.650
procurement and sales.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.670
Understand the strategic parameters

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.110
of financial planning.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.450
That is, we are talking about a long-

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.790
term financial plan, which embodies

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.610
the decision of managers, and the

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.630
investment is necessary to implement

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.190
the adopted strategy of value

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.290
growth of the business, and about

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.570
the ways of financing.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.250
These investment and financing decisions

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.930
use the price of capital as

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.070
a benchmark for comparing

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:41.510
alternatives and the target

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.170
structure of capital as

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.510
a parameter.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.370
In these decisions, the price of

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.490
capital is used as a benchmark

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.410
for comparing alternatives.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.610
Since the price of capital increases with

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.510
the increase of the share of borrowed funds,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.250
the task of management is to choose

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.310
the target structure of capital.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.710
The target structure depends

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.030
on several factors.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.690
For example, the asset structure.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.210
More intensely used loans are

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.190
those enterprises that have properties

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.490
suitable for collateral.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.610
The growth rate.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.270
Fast-growing companies are more

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.930
intensely using external funding.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.670
In this case, the cost of placing shares

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.710
is usually higher than the cost of borrowing.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.410


00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.290
and profitability.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.610
The next factor.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.650
Companies with high return

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.850
on invested capital prefer

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.670
to handle their own funds.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.310
They have a sufficient accumulated tribe to profit.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.600
Capital structure planning refers

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.100
to the area of financial leverage,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.080
the categories of which are used

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.400
in decisions about whether to take

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.440
loans or not, that is, the structure

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.800
of sources of financing.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.540
Leverage is the highest

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.560
skill in financial management.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.260
It is with the help of leverage

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.020
that financial managers decide the fate

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.840
of the company, how it will

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.720
develop in terms of profitability

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.940
and risk.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.940
Rentability and risk are polar motives

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.780
for decision making.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.820
High yields are usually

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.980
achieved at the cost of

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.900
risky actions.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.640
Therefore, in order to minimize risk,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.980
as managers are usually inclined

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.620
to take risks, shareholders require

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.200
a certain return on their

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.420
invested capital, so certain

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.980
rules of financing have been developed.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.620
These rules can be easily

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.180
controlled by the balance sheet

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.640
of any enterprise.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.020
Comparison of assets and liabilities

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.660
of the enterprise.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.300
Look at the slide.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.200
We have the main components

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.300
we need now, which we need to

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.140
pay attention to in the assets

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.380
and liabilities of the enterprise.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.120
The financing rules, the so-called

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.740
gold rule of financing, describe

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.660
the requirements for the

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.220
horizontal structure of the

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.980
balance sheet.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.780
In other words, the positions of assets and

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.140
positions of liabilities are compared.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.980
According to this rule, it is

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.760
necessary that long-

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.040
term asset positions that the

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.320
entity will use for long

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.760
periods of time be covered

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.960
by long-term financing sources.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.180
and short.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.840
Own capital must cover non-

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.700
currency assets, this is a narrow,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.940
strict rule of financing.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.400
The extended rule of financing

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.800
allows you to compare

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.020
all long-term sources

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.240
of financing, i.e. equity

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.940
and borrowed capital, with

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.840
non-currency assets.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.300
The golden rule of financing is

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.160
called the “golden rule” in German

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.360
financial management.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.460
But the requirement for the

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.220
vertical structure of capital

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.800
is that own capital,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.000
own sources of financing

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.020
exceed borrowed capital.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.100
This is the so-called 50-50

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.180
rule, the favorite American

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.520
rule of financing.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.720
As Americans say, the essence of

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.520
this rule is to limit this rule

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.720
is aimed at the risk sharing between

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.300
the investor-owner and the investor-loan.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.440
The owner has no right to expect

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.700
that by contributing

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.160
some small own capital,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.780
he can get a significant

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.720
loan.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.460
The rule says that 50-50 conditions

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.120
are necessary.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.360
It is in theory.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.100
In fact, the deviation of the share

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.660
of equity in the balance sheet

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.100
from the critical level, i.e.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.140
equity may be less than

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.040
50% due to the discrepancy of

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.280
the market balance sheet

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.940
value of the business.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.900
In addition, a low

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.240
share of equity can

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.600
be afforded by firms with

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.400
a stable and predictable

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.260
money supply, such

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.440
as retail, banking.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.700
In addition, if we take the statistics

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.240
of the enterprise, look at what we actually

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.360
have, as the enterprise solved its

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.000
problems of investment, financing,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.060
we will see that in the vast majority

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.980
of enterprises, for example,

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.440
in Germany, the reporting

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:41.020
rate does not exceed 25%.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.020
We see that the share of own capital,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.880
in addition, depends on the scale

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.360
of the business.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.740
The more turnover, the greater the

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.380
share of own capital.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.440
These rules can be

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.480
controlled, in addition to

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.020
comparing the balance sheet positions

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.140
as such, by calculating

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.980
special analytical coefficients.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.980
Please look at the main rates

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.620
that correspond to the

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.100
funding rules.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.180
The Golden Rule of Finance.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.200
The coefficient of coverage of

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.060
non-currency assets by own capital,

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.720
the coefficient of assets

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.360
by own capital, the coefficient

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.100
of maneuverability

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.700
of own capital and the

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.600
coefficients of financial stability.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.840
These rates are calculated from the

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.120
data of the report and are

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.160
the main condition for obtaining

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.460
new loans.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.320
Their regulatory value, usually

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.080
iris and lomates Each bank

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.820
chooses its favorite

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.520
coefficient and focuses on

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.260
this coefficient.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.720
We see that, in principle, these

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.540
coefficients duplicate each other, they

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.000
are interrelated.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.900
It is enough to choose one

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.140
of the factors and control

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.240
its normative value.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.940
Thus, the output parameters of financial

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.400
forecasting, strategic financial

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.900
planning and the basis for

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.060
the next stage, for current

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.700
planning, are the amount, the

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.140
amount of investment that determines

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.900
the structure of assets,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.580
sources of financing and,

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.180
accordingly, the structure

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.560
of capital-passive,

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.000
profit accumulation

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.220
and net cash flow.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.750
We will now consider with you

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.030
the tactics of financial planning.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.030
Tactics are developed as a response

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.390
to the question of what we need

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.690
to do in our company to implement

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.350
the strategy.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.730
And as a response we set the

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.730
task of current financial planning

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.370
– ensuring financial balance.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.030
Please look at the

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.630
next slide.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.470
Figuratively, in the form of weights, the financial

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.170
balance is depicted.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.690
This is a state that allows the

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.530
development of the enterprise

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.490
to ensure the achievement

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.710
of the objectives, to balance

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.070
between two components, between

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.630
the desire for profitability and

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.550
the avoidance of risk, between

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.950
profitability and liquidity.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.950
We see in the center of the

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.390
slide the cornerstone – the conditions

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.730
for ensuring financial balance.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.130
These conditions form decisions,

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.210
strategic decisions, in the process of

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.290
forward-looking planning, which

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.530
are resolved.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.470
Investment and financing decisions.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.790
That is, financial balance is

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.710
based on the balance structure

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.650
of capital, on financial stability.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.760
We remember the rules of

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.720
financing, and it is compliance

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.440
with these rules that determines our

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.420
financial sustainability.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.500
Financial sustainability creates conditions

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.820
for a balance between liquidity

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.980
and profitability.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.840
Financial stability is the ability

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.540
of the enterprise to maintain independence

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.260
when changes in the financial

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.100
markets, to maintain independence

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.060
from creditors, and to

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.820
maintain independence.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.880
Financial stability is our rule of

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.200
50-50, and the corresponding coefficients,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.940
which can be calculated

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.540
by the company's forecast balance

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.740
sheet, by the results

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.660
of strategic planning.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.500
This is the financial activity

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.180
rate, or sometimes called the shoulder

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.040
of the financial leverage,

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.440
the financial dependence

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.460
rate, the level of own capital.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.620
You see, by the scheme of calculations

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.660
all these indicators are interrelated,

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.440
and all based on the

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.880
rule of equity must exceed

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.140
borrowed capital.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.020
For example, an enterprise can

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.920
be considered absolutely

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.160
stable, hypothetically, it is

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.120
rare to find such an enterprise

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.940
in life, an enterprise that

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.900
uses only its own asset, which

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.780
has no borrowing funds

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.820
at all.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.340
Normal financial sustainability is

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.320
compliance with the rules of financing.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.560
Own and borrowed

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.840
funds are used equally.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.360
Instable financial position,

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.900
if the entity uses additional,

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.280
unreasonable sources to cover

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.460
part of the inventories.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.860
And critical, finally, financial

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.080
situation, when the enterprise

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.880
has unpaid loans, outstanding

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.560
debts, the enterprise

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.200
is insolvent.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:10.740
Our slide is shifting, liquidity

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.340
falls on this picture.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.140
In general, liquidity is a

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.800
rather problematic category, both

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.920
in theory and in practice.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.760
Theoretically, this concept

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.000
is considered in a broad and narrow

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.320
sense, in a broad sense.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.600
Liquidity is in line with

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.560
cash flow.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.120
We talked about this at the very

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.000
beginning, representing a

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.700
financial enterprise in

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.660
terms of cash flow.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.660
From this point of view, liquidity

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:44.680
can be identified with financial sustainability.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.440
Long-term liquidity, structural

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.040
liquidity - liquidity

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.340
that is obtained as a result

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.100
of financing decisions.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.400
On the other hand, liquidity is often

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:02.980
understood as something close to solvency.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.430
Liquidity is current, as a condition

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.130
for ensuring solvency, I

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.610
suggest you consider.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.390
Well, another concept is liquidity

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.430
in terms of current asset

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:17.910
turnover.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.130
It is the ability of assets

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.110
to transform in the process

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.590
of turnover of assets

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.910
and to transform into absolutely

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.590
liquid assets, cash.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.550
The problem of liquidity indicators is

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.810
related to the fact that in practice

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.190
there is always a question about their

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.730
regulatory level.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.170
Which company is good

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.530
in terms of liquidity?

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.190
And attempts to introduce some common

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.870
concepts, rules, coefficients equal

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.850
to all, they are, of course, unsustainable.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.710
Liquidity is a characteristic

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.050
that depends largely

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.890
on the industry

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.130
of the enterprise.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.730
And, of course, the requirement

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.790
for the current liquidity ratio, which

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.510
should exceed two, it, of course,

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.230
does not withstand any criticism,

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.470
we have spoken a lot about it,

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.750
but, at the extreme, so far,

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.750
it is the only financial regulation

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.390
official that exists.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.230
And, of course, a disruption

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.570
of financial balance, a breakdown

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.470
in one direction or the other,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.830
can lead to risky critical

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.470
situations, insolvency, insolvency

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.090
or bankruptcy.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.270
In general, I would like to draw your attention,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.890
you have already listened, apparently,

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.610
these courses in other topics of financial

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.070
management, here, for financial planning,

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.010
it is important for us to understand

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.710
that, in principle, the concept of

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.570
financial stability and liquidity, they

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:58.770
are, in economic essence, unified and

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.710
interrelated, and characterize,

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.450
resulting from compliance with

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.470
the rules of financing, link between

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.390
the structure of assets and the

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.530
structure of liabilities.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.110
The degree of insolvency of

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.430
the enterprise is a narrower

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.330
concept, and it can

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.410
be controlled for the absence

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.230
of money on the enterprise account,

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.110
for default debts.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.570
In our realities, the critical

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.470
period of delay in payments is 3

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.050
months.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.490
Under the bankruptcy law,

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.830
in this sad case, the

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.290
enterprise may be as a debtor

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:42.450
responsible for its costs,

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.050
including financial planning.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.970
It could be an air case

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.330
against him.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.410
These indicators – financial

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.710
stability, liquidity, regulatory

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.350
capacity – are needed for

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.630
financial planning as limiting

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.750
factors of risk.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.970
On the opposite side of the weights

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.070
we have indicators of efficiency,

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.630
profitability, profitability and turnover.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.970
Or, for example, if

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.790
the company is taking an aggressive

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.630
policy to increase

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.210
its market share.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.110
Such a goal is real.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.150
Tasks are interesting and necessary.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:30.230
They plan to increase production

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.490
volumes under this strategy,

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.070
plan additional investments

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.810
in production capacities.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.610
In the event of changes in the market

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.510
situation, for example, some

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:47.490
shocks, shifts, a decrease

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.830
in solvency demand and the

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.230
inability to sell products

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.430
in planned volumes.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.710
There are losses due to the operation

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.010
leverage.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.510
Another risky situation

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.750
is that the enterprise

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.650
uses additional loans to

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.130
ensure this planned growth

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:11.690
in sales.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.230
Additional loans can lead to

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.970
loss of financial stability

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.950
due to the effect of the financial

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:19.530
leverage.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.770
High profitability of assets.

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.550
Another goal.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.530
The purpose of profitability, the purpose of ensuring

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.210
the effectiveness of activities.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.030
This can be achieved by minimizing

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.090
stocks.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.450
Minimum stock, they are full of breakdowns.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.470
At some point, we may not have

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:43.790
enough money to buy a new

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.110
batch of goods.

00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.910
We may not have components

00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:49.330
in the warehouse for production

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.030
launch.

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:55.070
Or even, if we have a new customer,

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.170
we will somehow meet his demand

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:02.130
and provide his products,

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.970
which we do not have in

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.170
stock at the moment.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.010
We lose the product.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.310
Thus, we can schematically

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.010
imagine that current financial

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.030
planning should provide aggregates,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.090
as a parameter of operational

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.510
efficiency, profitability,

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.010
turning on one side,

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.830
as you see on the slide,

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.410
and financial stability,

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:27.970
liquidity

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.030
and solvency.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.850
And all this, of course, is aimed at increasing

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.790
the market value of the company.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.490
Now, after we have dismantled

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.390
such bases, the parameters of

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.490
current planning, I will ask you

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.230
to look at the accounts of your company.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.330
The form of reporting, form 1 and

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.510
2, public reporting, when you should

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.610
always have them at hand,

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.890
you can get them.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.570
From that point of view.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.550
What is the focus on financial

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.250
sustainability and liquidity?

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.810
Isn't there now, as you know the

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:09.530
parameters, no threat of non-payability?

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.850
Well, a more complete analysis will

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.870
allow you to identify problem

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.490
areas and set the task of

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.670
changing tactics, to mark the

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:33.580
regulatory level So, friends, we

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.960
have considered strategic

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.520
planning parameters, planning tactics,

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.600
and now we move to operational

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.840
planning and consider the

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.280
parameters of operational management.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.520
This is the parameter of the

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.120
financial cycle.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.860
The financial cycle is the

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.700
period of cash circulation,

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.840
the time during which money is

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.880
withdrawn from circulation.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.520
This is the time between the outflow of

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.220
funds and the influx of funds.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.260
On the slide you see the components of

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.650
the financial cycle and see that the

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.650
financial cycle is loaded onto the operating

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.170
cycle in connection with the fact that

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.590
we may receive a deferred payment

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:28.230
for providing us with resources.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.490
The financial cycle requires

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.250
optimization.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.870
Maximum reduction in

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.730
the financial cycle is the main

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.830
increase in the cost of a business

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.010
for lower levels of management,

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.870
but of course there are

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.410
limits.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:48.850
We cannot reduce it to infinity.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.450
Therefore, we need to

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.970
observe certain norms, parameters

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.890
in the activities of

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.590
the lower management, which

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.870
are bound to financial

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.230
activity, but are clear

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.110
and understandable

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.630
to each producer.

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.870
Well, for example, we will consider

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.790
these norms in the range of the

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.250
main components of activity - procurement,

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.750
production, operational

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.050
sphere and sales.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.810
With re-acquisition, such a norm

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:23.790
is the rate of stocks in days.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.710
This indicator is identical to the

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.530
periodicity of supply.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.290
The inventory rate is the days

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.750
for which we create a stock to

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.510
provide its necessary minimum

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.190
but sufficient level for

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.210
the time interval between one

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.610
and the other supply.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.670
This is a management norm,

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.530
understandable in

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.850
the field of logistical support.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.870
In the financial sphere, it represents

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.970
in the form of stock value and

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.070
is formed as a result of

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.830
a certain delay in payments that

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:12.670
we receive for the supply of resources.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.150
The next sphere of activity is

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.810
the operational sphere, current

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.050
activities, production for

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.530
production companies.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.510
The most important norm of operational

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.110
management is the duration of the production

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.550
cycle, the time interval between the moment

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.750
of launching the product into production

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.990
and the moment of receipt of the

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.350
finished products to the warehouse.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.610
The financial indicator

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.190
of the corresponding duration of

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.750
the production cycle is the

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:41.570
cost of unfinished production

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.410
of the NPP.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.610
The shorter this cycle, the

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:47.770
more efficiently organized

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.510
the production activity of the enterprise.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.990
In the field of sales, the standard of inventory

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.250
of finished products is an important

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.330
operational standard of management.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.630
The finished product is stored

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:03.170
in the warehouse for some

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.930
time, inevitably.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.430
For each company there is a

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.110
certain average period,

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.950
characteristic of this

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.830
industry.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.630
On the other hand, in the financial

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:22.710
sphere we have debit debt,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.030
which is formed in connection

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:27.550
with delayed payments.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.450
The financial measure of the inventory

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.810
of finished products is the cost

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.630
of the inventory of finished products.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.950
These norms form, let's look

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.950
again the scheme, the duration

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.790
of the financial cycle.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.910
For example, how these indicators

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.930
work in the framework of planning.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.350
If we have planned according

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.150
to the parameters of the annual

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.890
plan, the current plan, the duration

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.090
of the financial cycle is 30 days for all components.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.570
In fact, after six months, the conditions

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.490
of sale deteriorated.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.230
And payments for our products will

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.230
be received for a few days,

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.510
let's say 10 days later.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.870
From a financial point of view, this

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.550
means the threat of liquidity collapse.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.470
That is, we have a layer of time

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:26.350
that needs to be closed with something.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:31.010
Or capital, but these extreme measures are undesirable.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.030
Or it is necessary to put the

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.010
task before the production

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.330
units and to push some

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.230
norms at other stages.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.990
For example, to put a task before technologists,

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.770
before the organizers of production,

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:45.990
to stretch the duration

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.690
of the manufacturing

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.630
process, the duration of

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.550
the production processes.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.670
If this does not work, then you

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:58.130
will have to take additional

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.690
advantages.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.090
Naturally, it carries additional costs.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.750
A major problem of operational

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.730
management money management is related

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.690
to the field of handling

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.990
the instability of payments.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.190
Especially if the company has

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.930
some seasonality, instability

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.150
of production.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.830
Companies that work on contracts.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.050
For example, for construction

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.170
companies that are active

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.770
in the summer period.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.730
They have money in their accounts from

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:31.970
August to December.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.510
They will be used for new

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.610
projects next autumn.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.750
As a result, cash gaps are

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.430
formed, which you need

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.870
to provide, plan the coverage

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.690
of cash gaps, receive

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.590
additional loans.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:50.990
Well, I hope you have already

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.870
calculated the duration of

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.830
your company's financial cycle.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.790
This is a situation where

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:02.590
the financial cycle is negative.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.610
What does this mean?

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.010
This is the dream of any financial manager.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.430
This is how big supermarkets work.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:15.010
The condition is a half-year deferral

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.490
of payments for the delivery of products.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.110
This is a common condition for the largest

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.110
supermarket chains.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.690
As a result, look, please,

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.430
from the financial cycle, they

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:29.990
have only one problem left

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:33.270
– inventory management.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.170
And for this purpose, the inventory

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.430
isined at the regulatory level

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.110
and sales are carried out from

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.750
excess inventories at low, we

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:45.050
can say, dump prices.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:46.910
So this expression and

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.690
stereotype can you buy

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.710
cheap, good, quality things.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.390
I am in the era of deficit.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:58.010
Today we already know what can be

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.610
where, in those companies that

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:03.290
know how to manage their financial cycle.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.730
Please, I will ask you on the scheme

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:07.770
to put the duration of the

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.410
component adopted by your company,

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.990
calculate the operational and

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.330
financial cycle.

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:16.110
Something can and needs to be changed.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.070
I hope that the delay in purchasing

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.970
goods that your suppliers provide

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:27.010
you, the delay in delivering

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.950
resources, exceeds your delay

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.190
that you deliver to buyers and

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.050
customers for your product

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.890
and services.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:41.010
If not, you can immediately say that

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.870
the success of planning will

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.930
most likely be unsuccessful.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.570
I also picked up for you, they

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.610
are in the context, examples

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.650
of financial cycle management

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.930
in Metro Cash & Carry, IBM, Ford,

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.210
General Motors and others.

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:57.490
and wonder.
