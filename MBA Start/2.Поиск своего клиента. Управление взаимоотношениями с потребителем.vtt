00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, we have looked at the models of the buyer's behavior.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
What do we need it for?

00:13.000 --> 00:27.000
Not only to identify the model, not only to understand where to sell, how, but also what to offer, what offer to make so that our client, our buyer, understands that this is his product,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
because it satisfies some of his needs.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, since we have talked with you about needs and needs, I suggest you remember, just remember the Maslow pyramid.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
This is a very famous pyramid that shows how a person develops and what he wants at every stage of his development.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Such a pyramid, which at the base of its own has physiological needs.

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
This is thirst, this is hunger, this is cold, when you need to dress, for example, and so on.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
That is, all the physiological needs that a person must constantly satisfy, otherwise he simply will not be able to live.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
So, of course, the first level is physiological needs.

01:10.000 --> 01:25.000
If he is not satisfied with them, you can offer him anything, self-realization, some status, he will not be interested in it at all, because he has not yet taken the first step.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Therefore, at the first stage, of course, the buyer must realize that everything is fine with him.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
He has something to eat, something to drink, something to wear, where to live, and so on.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
That is, at some level, he has already satisfied his needs and he can think about something more.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
And what is next in the pyramid of needs? Of course, safety.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
We want to feel safe, we want to understand that nothing threatens us.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
And this is actually a very important need, the safety of us, our family, our colleagues, maybe.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Therefore, of course, the second thing a person thinks about is his safety.

02:05.000 --> 02:18.000
If this need is satisfied, he feels that everything is fine, tomorrow he will not be kicked out of work, he will have a stable income, he will be able to satisfy his physiological needs due to this, and he feels calm.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
Then he thinks about where he is, in what social environment he lives, who are his colleagues, who are his colleagues at work, who are his friends, who are his family.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Communication is necessary for a person, like air, for someone more, for someone less.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
But without this, we cannot live, because we live in a society, and it is important to us who we communicate with and how we communicate.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Therefore, the next need that he satisfies is a need in communication.

02:46.000 --> 02:59.000
When this need is satisfied, then for us the two most interesting stages of this pyramid are self-respect and self-realization.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Self-respect is important for a person.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
It is important to understand that, yes, I have achieved something, I am doing it now, someone needs it.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
This is a very important point, to be praised, to be understood, otherwise he feels some emptiness.

03:15.000 --> 03:23.000
And the next moment is self-realization, when a person strives for the set goal and, in fact, reaches some heights.

03:23.000 --> 03:32.000
Probably, not all people reach the top of the pyramid, but maybe at some level everyone reaches it.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
This is a controversial issue.

03:34.000 --> 03:46.000
But I want to say that when we identify the consumer value, we can guide ourselves very well on the Maslow pyramid.

03:46.000 --> 03:55.000
Because here all the values are there, and you can choose and show what we satisfy with our products.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And it will be completely clear to a person, because it is in the language of people.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I want to give a very simple example.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
We all probably eat bread.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I want to give an example with bread.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
For example, we wanted to produce a small loaf of bread, 250 grams, not as usual, but 250 grams.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
What is it for?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And how to show its benefit and its advantages?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Very simple.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
We make a table and make two columns.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
In the first column we show the benefit for the consumer or for the client.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
And in the second column we show what motive we satisfy, or rather what need we offer.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
So, look at what happens here.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
What are the benefits for the consumer?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
For example, bread is always fresh.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Since it is small, we can buy it often.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
It is not necessary to buy a large loaf of bread.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
The second point is that it is cheaper when buying.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Maybe we have a limited amount of money, we want to buy something else.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
We save a little on this.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Next, no waste.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
We do not throw away bread.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Because the loaf is small, we eat it.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
And we do not throw away our products and our means.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
The next point is that it is convenient to wear.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Maybe I have such a heavy bag, and the loaf is big.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
It is impossible to make this knife.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
Therefore, a small loaf will make it easy for me to walk with it.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
The next point is the ability to buy other products.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
The range is different.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I will not only buy bread, but something else.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Or maybe I will buy two different loaves of bread of different varieties.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
As an option.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
For example, we have identified such benefits.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
What can a person get from such a small loaf of bread?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
And now, a satisfying motive.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
What do we satisfy every time?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Always fresh is safety.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We do not get poisoned.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
At least it will not spoil.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Cheaper when buying.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
The motive of saving.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
No waste is also saving.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
We do not throw away our means.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
The next point is that it is convenient to wear.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
And this is comfort.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
And it is possible to buy other products.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Different range.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
This is also comfort.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
It is convenient for us.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It is good for us.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
When you sign the benefit for the buyer in such a language,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
you understand why he does it.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And it is easier for you to sell.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Because you will speak his language.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I will give another example from the industrial market,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
which will show how you can sign benefits and advantages.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And I will give an example on the lifts.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
On the lifts, this is such a device.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Hydraulic lift.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
On which you become, press the button,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
and rise to a height of 12.5 meters.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
It is suitable for construction works.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
It is suitable for exhibitions, museums, art galleries.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
A very good device that makes work safer

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
than climbing stairs.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
A person feels safer, more comfortable.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
And so on.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Let's see what table we made

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
when we identified the consumer value for this product.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The first is the feature.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Here we write consumer values.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
What can we offer?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
What consumer things are important for the lift?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
And we write that this is reliability.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
This is reliability.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
You get up, rise, do not fall anywhere.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Everything is clear, good and not scary.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
A reliable device.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Next. Features.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
What features can we show?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Unique guide technology.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
What is it?

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
The telescopic lift works on the principle of a telescopic antenna.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
And when you press the button, you just easily rise up.

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
This unique guide technology allows you to smoothly lift a person without jerks.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Next. What are the advantages?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
What do we show?

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
The ability to rise to a height without help.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
We do not need to attract someone.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
We do not need to force someone to work extra.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
We can do it ourselves.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Again, economy, comfort.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
What benefits does the company that buys such a lift get?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
First, convenience.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Second, time saving.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Because you do not need to involve additional people.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Everything can be done yourself and quickly.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Next. Energy saving and fast results.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
You do not need to wait for anyone.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Everything can be done yourself.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
And the evidence that we provide for the fact that it really is so.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
The lift works independently.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Independently, reliably, without help.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
This is how you can sit down and schedule your products or services.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
This is a very useful thing, because then you understand why your product is being bought.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
And then it is very easy for you to present and sell it.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
Because you clearly understood the needs of the buyers, your advantages, and combined all this.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Here is such an example.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I recommend it.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Very useful exercise to understand your assortment very well.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
The next step.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Well, we have considered the models of buyer behavior.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And I want to move on to the next point.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
When we already know how our buyers buy.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
When we know our target segments.

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
The next step we can take is to turn to our most important clients.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
This is what we will be considering now.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
The first thing I suggest is to return to segmentation, but only to micro-segmentation.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Micro-segmentation is the division within the company of clients.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
That is, we do not divide the external market, but within the company.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
We consider what clients we have and how they work.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
The next method.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
We assess by two main groups of parameters.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
The first is the attractiveness of the client for the company.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
That is, how interesting is the client to us.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And the second point.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Are we interesting to him?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Very few companies ask such a question, unfortunately.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
In fact, thanks to the fact that we ask this question, we will get very interesting answers.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
What are we doing?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
In each group we write down the criteria for assessment.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
This is the volume of deliveries, the regularity of deliveries, the potential profit,

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
compatibility, the growth of the company in the market, the availability of warehouses and logistics.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
You can adjust the criteria that will be interesting to you.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
The main task is to assess the client's attractiveness.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That is, to see how interesting he is to you.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
You can put financial stability here.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The criteria can be completely different.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Experience of work in the market, etc.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
What do you do next?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And then you set the weights in the amount.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
The weight should be 10 points.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Here is an example.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
You can take 1 in the amount.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
In the example, in the method, 10 points.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Set the weights.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
That is, look at which criteria are most important.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
And assign the most weight.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Then start evaluating the company by points.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
The point is evaluated from 1 to 9 points.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
From 1 to 9 points.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
An assessment is carried out, and then the rating is set.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Weight per point, weight per point, weight per point.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
What is done next?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
The sum is added by points.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And you get a point for each company.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
You can have an infinite number of clients.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
If you have 200, then maybe all 200 should be evaluated.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
The example is given here for two clients.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
The assessment is carried out by the company's expert council.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
These are sales managers, all commercial employees,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
who are only associated with these clients.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Marketologists can be managers of the middle class.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
The middle class is those who are related to marketing and sales.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
And we move on to the second assessment.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
The second assessment is our ability to serve these clients.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
That is, to see if they are interested in us or not.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And here we make the following criteria.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Assortment. Does our assortment suit them?

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Does their quality of our products suit them?

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
Next. Is our market experience sufficient to offer them products or services?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
What do they think?

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Next. Do we provide technical support to these companies?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Next point. What is the qualification of our staff?

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
And our financial stability in the market?

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
That is, this assessment is already from the clients.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Here we put more weight.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
We took 100, although it could also be 10,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
but we took 100 points so that there was more sensitivity,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
more options, more assessments.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Next. We put points in the same way and multiply the weight by a point,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
weight by a point, and then add the sum by a column.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
And we get two assessments for each company.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
One from our point of view, and the other from the client's point of view.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
What do we get?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
We get the following graph, which is presented to you on the slide.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
This is a matrix of internal segmentation of clients.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
And here we have divided into four groups.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Our clients are divided.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Each client has two coordinates.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
We got the market attractiveness and, in fact,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
the attractiveness of us as a company.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
So, we build on the coordinates of our company and get some results.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
What are the four groups here?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
These are developing key clients,

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
these are just key clients, standard clients, and potential clients.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
In brackets, we can write that they are not attractive for us,

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
or not promising, because two groups will be added here.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
I will comment on each group and what we get.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
The first group is developing clients.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Attractiveness.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
That is, we are interested in this client, but we are not very interested in him.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
He works with us until he finds another supplier, maybe.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Key clients.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
We are interested in them, and they are interested in us.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
That is, mutual satisfaction occurs.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
And we have found a common language and work very well together.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Standard clients.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
We are interested in them, but they are not very interested in us.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
They develop poorly.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
And they buy something, sell something.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Not as we would like.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
The question is what to do with them. We will see.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
And potential clients, or, as I said, not attractive.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Maybe these are new clients with whom you have just started working,

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
and you still cannot assess how they work for you and whether they like you or not.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
Or maybe these are clients who have been in this square for a long time.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
They take away your funds, resources, money, people's time.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And they do not give results.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
That is, there can be at least two categories here.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Well, let's see what each category means.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Key clients are, of course, the gold mine of the company.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
This is active support, these are preferences.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Anything that can be supported by any support.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
The only subtlety.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
Never allow at least one client to occupy more than 20% of your turnover.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Otherwise you will get addicted to him.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
He will start manipulating you.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Setting his rules, prices, delivery times, payment time, and so on.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
That is, you get addicted.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
Therefore, no matter what key clients there are, be sure to feel this limit.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
The next group of clients is developing clients.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
That is, we really like this client, but we do not satisfy him in something.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
We do not have enough opportunities to work with them actively.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
That's why we have to do something here.

16:36.000 --> 16:45.000
We must clearly consider what events we must hold to transfer these clients to the key category.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
This is our job within our company.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
We must clearly understand what we are aiming at.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
The next group of clients is standard.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
As we said, we like them very much, but we do not like them very much.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
What do we do here?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Here we make decisions.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
Either we start to develop them and understand how they grow.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Or we make decisions if there is no prospect, and whether to continue working with them.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
That is, there must be a very serious decision here.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
It's like in relationships between people.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Do you like it or not?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
If you don't like it, what to do next?

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Either leave and go, or not contact.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
Or understand where to find the best sides and how to develop our relations.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
The same is true with clients.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And potential clients, or not promising.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
As I said, two groups come here.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
New ones come here because we are not actively working with them yet, and they are not actively working with us.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
Then we will look at the new clients separately, at the steps that need to be taken.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
And if these are clients who have long been in this square, then you need to make a decision whether to continue working with them.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
Completely clearly understanding that these clients only distract you with money and funds.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
They can be called sick children of these clients.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Why? Or hard children.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
Because they distract a lot of attention, but in fact they do not give any benefit.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Therefore, be very careful with this category.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Well, colleagues, let's consider who are the key clients.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
We have highlighted them according to the method we have just considered.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And what to do next with them and what do they represent?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
The first point.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
Key clients are those who, of course, steadily generate income and profits.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Of course, clients can be different.

18:40.000 --> 18:47.000
They can be very large and require very large discounts, and then the profit may be slightly less in percentage terms.

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
But due to the turnover they bring to us, the profit, of course, is a significant part of all clients.

18:55.000 --> 19:04.000
Very often the Pareto rule is also used here, which says that 80% of the income brings 20% of the clients.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
These are just your key clients.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
The next point that we take into account.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Key clients allow us to reduce costs.

19:13.000 --> 19:20.000
Why? We do not need to send a lot of products to different small clients.

19:20.000 --> 19:29.000
We send it all in batches, sell it in batches, produce it well, and the cost is reduced by a unit of production.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Naturally, the cost is also reduced.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Another point to consider.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
The key client company that works with you, takes a lot of turns,

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
seeks to improve your position in the market, your offer,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
because it helps you promote this product.

19:45.000 --> 19:52.000
They themselves are interested in this, in addition to having the opportunity to sell large batches of products.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
The next point is very important.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Key clients help to bring new products to the market.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
As I said, new products are always high risks and problems that arise in the market.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Therefore, it is important to offer new products to key clients.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
They will help you to bring your new product to the market more professionally

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
and solve all the issues at the stage of release.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Another point that can characterize key clients.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
This is a client who is politically significant to us.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
For example, he is in some region or some industry,

20:28.000 --> 20:35.000
but he represents us in this market, he has an administrative resource at the local level,

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
and he positions us more correctly, more clearly.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
That is, we simply cannot break off relations with him,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
because otherwise we will not be able to actively and well enter this region.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Another point that characterizes key clients in the same way.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
A client is interested in servicing his product, or rather in servicing our product.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
A service service can be created,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
maybe technical and service support for other clients,

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
end consumers to whom he sells our product.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
It is very important when there is service service,

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
because today, as I said at the beginning, the price is only in the 7th place,

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
so service plays one of the primary roles.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
And this is exactly what a key client helps us with.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
What are the advantages of key clients?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
What do they give to the company?

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Although I want to say that when we select key clients,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
it is important for us to know another thing.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
What do we give to our clients?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Why do they work so well with us?

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Why do they take such a large amount of our products?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Why do they consider us their partners?

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
Nevertheless, of course, by setting a goal, setting a strategy,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
we must also evaluate our advantages.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
What do they give us?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
As I said, this is the first significant share of the turnover,

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
the volume of our sales and the stability of planning.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Further.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
If we have guaranteed sales,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
then we can make large purchases,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
which gives additional discounts.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
That is, we again reduce costs and reduce costs.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
The next point is the reduction of costs,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
which is associated with attracting new clients.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
If we did not have our key, such good clients,

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
we would have to make attempts again and again to find new clients.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And this, as we have already said, is a very large cost.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
In this sense, we also save money and optimize our resources.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
The next point is that marketing costs are reduced.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Why?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
First, we have already attracted them.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
And secondly, key clients often invest their funds,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
part of their funds, to promote our product,

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
because they also need to offer it further, sell it, promote it.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
As for new products,

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
again, the advantage is that this group of clients allows us to test their new product,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
test it on the market, see how it is progressing,

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
listen to their advice, opinions, even look for new ideas.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Key clients often give new ideas for the production of our products.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
And, of course, competition and stability in the market are growing.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
That is, there is a greater barrier for competition.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
If we have a very good relationship with a key client,

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
it means that he will not switch with any small change in the price policy of our competitors.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
The next factor is that the image of reliability and stability of the company is formed,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
not only in the eyes of key clients,

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
but, importantly, in the eyes of our own employees.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Employees understand that the company is stable, the company is developing well,

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
it has permanent clients, it will never die on this market and will not disappear.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
In the same way, for investors, when we want to launch a new product

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and we need additional investments,

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
this stability helps us show how well we are in this market,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
what small risks we have.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
The next thing is that operational work is simplified.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Less overhead costs are needed, less additional transport is needed,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
fewer warehouse costs.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
That is, look how many additional advantages.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
The next point is that we can ask key clients for information

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
about the actions of competitors, about the situation on the market,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
how they are developing.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
When we have trust between us, they are willing to share this information.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Naturally, we reduce money on research.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
The next point is that clients become advertising agents.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
They tell about our product, they attract more clients to it.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
That is, again, a reduction in advertising costs.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
Another very important point is that we increase the share of the client's turnover.

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
It is very difficult for the client to break our relations with him,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
because we are already significant to him.

25:08.000 --> 25:16.000
Naturally, in this way, we also increase our presence and share on this market.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Advantages of the Advertising Platform

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We have discussed the advantages.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
But how can we work with these clients?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
What practice does exist?

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
There is a whole algorithm of how we approach our key clients.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
And we have already discussed during our communication

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
what steps we take.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Some of them have already been discussed.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
The first is, of course, the general market.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Then we divide it into segments.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
We have discussed the methods.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Then we choose the optimal segments.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
These are the ones we can work with.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
There are two target segments.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
And the next one is the segment with the possibility of partial consumption.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
This is what we have discussed.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Then we choose the target from the optimal.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
That is, we narrow the market.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
In the target segment, we select significant clients.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
Those who are not really small, not disposable clients,

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
but those with whom we work stably and have a more or less serious turnover.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
And only from significant clients we select a group of key ones.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
Not all significant clients need to be built client-oriented relationships.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Remember, we were considering the methodology.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
There are developing clients.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
They are in the category of significant, but not key.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
Our task is to create as many key clients as possible.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
To make our relationships partner-oriented and stable

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
in order to get all the advantages that we have discussed above.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
Client-oriented companies that have been working on this market for a long time

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
have received serious results in favor of the fact that such a strategy brings money.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
According to the data of the Association of Managers, which conducted research last year,

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
I would like to give you some results to convince you of the seriousness of such work.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
The first point that companies working on this strategy note

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
is the increase in the number of re-purchases.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
66% is a very large percentage, you must agree.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
The reduction in costs by 81%.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Can you imagine what a serious reduction in costs,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
what kind of optimization a company can get in such a work?

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
The next point is the reduction in losses caused by customer dissatisfaction.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
The client did not like something, he took a claim, left, did not tell you anything.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
In fact, when we work with our key clients seriously,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
we evaluate their claims, solve their problems,

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
the loss of clients is reduced by 77%.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
The attraction of new clients is 51%.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
Why? They look at the market and see a stable company,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and they become interested in working.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
Our key clients talk about us, work as advertising agents

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
and attract additional new clients to our company.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
This is our new potential.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
Accordingly, we also reduce costs for attracting new clients.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
The increase in productivity of work is 80% due to the reduction of operational work.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
The company spends a lot of money,

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
and we save 80% of all operational work.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
The next result achieved by the company is the acceleration of the import of new products to the market.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
The reduction of risks of this import is 46%.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
46% is a very good result, because a new product is always a risk.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
Another point is the reduction of the risk of losing clients.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
When does this risk arise?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
When our key managers leave.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And this happens, unfortunately.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Life is life, everyone is looking for the best place under the sun.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
Therefore, one way or another, our employees will change their job,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
will leave, improve their qualifications, grow.

29:24.000 --> 29:31.000
Therefore, it happens very often that a key manager leaves the company.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Clients leave with him.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
Because the relationship is very important in this case.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
When we do a full-fledged job with a key client,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
clients stay, because they are attached not only to the manager,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
not only to his personal qualities or characteristics,

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
not only to his promises, but to the company itself,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
which fulfills its obligations, supplies goods, reduces costs,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
and provides competitive products.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
The client is attached to us.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
And 76% is the result achieved by companies that work according to this strategy.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
I think these figures are more than convincing.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
We need to understand whether we are a client-oriented company or not.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
There are methods for assessing client-orientedness.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
The methods are different.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Different authors provide their variations.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I want to offer you one of them.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
In fact, any method, both this and all the others that we are considering,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
is a method of client-orientedness.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
It is a method of client-orientedness,

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
which is based on the idea that the client is a client.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
And this and all the others that we are considering

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
must be adapted to your company.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Otherwise, it will be a dead method, it will not work.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
That is, it needs to be adjusted to the activity of your industry,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
your product, your company.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
We will consider one of the methods that helps you assess

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
how loyal clients are to you

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
and whether your company is client-oriented to this day.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
The method consists of six main blocks.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
That is, we assess the company in six blocks.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
This is internal support, team dynamics,

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
relations with clients, client status,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
further on, work with the client that is being conducted,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
project management.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
We will consider all six points in detail.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
The first item is internal support and opportunities of our company.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
This item assesses how well your work on key clients is built inside the company.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Do you have support from the management?

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
Is a business process designed to be directed only to key clients?

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
Does the team or the team leader have certain powers

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
in terms of making decisions?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Does he have resources?

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
And does he not interfere with other functional units

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
in solving your issues?

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
For example, the financial service, the delivery service,

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
the delivery service that can sabotage the delivery of some product

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
that is important for your key client.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Here you can add various criteria.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
These four criteria are the basic ones

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
on which you set the assessment and compare.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
In your workbook, the method will be fully described.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
In the slides, we see the final schedule.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
In the workbook, you will be able to assess

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
how client-oriented your company is.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
The next item is the dynamics of the team

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
in working with key clients.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
What is included here?

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
The first point that we must assess

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
is whether you have a plan for working with key clients.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
The plan, the result that you should achieve,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
the efficiency indicators, and so on.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Next.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
How is communication established inside the unit?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
How do you cooperate with each other,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
how do you agree on things,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
how do you help each other solve problems?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Next.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Is communication established between your unit

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
and the unit of the key client?

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Look, there can be different units.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
There can be a company manager,

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
a commercial director, a purchase director.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
With all these people making decisions

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
or participating in making decisions,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
clear communication should be established.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Another point that needs to be assessed

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
is whether your employees have the skills

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
to work with key clients.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
In fact, this is a very important point,

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
because if non-professional people

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
work in such a responsible team,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
it can lead to the failure of all your efforts

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
and all your investments.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
The next block is the relationship with clients.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
We assess what kind of relationship we have with them.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
The first block that we assess,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
or rather the first criterion,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
is whether you have information

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
about who in the company makes decisions

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
or participates in making decisions.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Roughly speaking, who do you need to establish

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
clear contacts with

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
to facilitate the quick resolution

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
of all issues that arise in the process of activity.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Next point.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
Do you know what values your client has?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
What is really important to them?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
What is the company's goal?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
What technologies do they use in their work?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Knowing what they use in their work,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
it will be easier for you to offer them

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
an additional product or improve the existing product.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Next.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
Do you have a common goal or a common project?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
This point is very important,

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
because having a common goal and a common project,

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
you can attach more strongly to yourself

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
a key client.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
And, in fact, do you have a common business process?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
This is also a good point,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
because when the business processes are common,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the logic of the action is clearly clear.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
It is easier to work.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
The next block that we assess is the status.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
The status of a key client,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
of us as a supplier,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
how he treats us.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Are we a key supplier for him?

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Is our status growing year by year

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
or quarter by quarter?

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
Does the client take us into a serious position

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
and does he communicate well with us?

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
Do our assortments and quality of services

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
suit him?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
That is, how much of the full range

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
do we provide him with the necessary products and services?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
The next block that we assess is the work with clients.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
How is it carried out?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
The first criterion that is here

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
is your business is focused on a key client.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And the key client is more important to you

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
than the minute profit.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You know, this is a very controversial point,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
especially for the company managers.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Nevertheless, I want to say

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
that today's profit is just today,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
and the relationship with the client

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
is your future and your development.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
So choose what is more important to you.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
The next point that we assess

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
is the analysis of the positive impact

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
of working with key clients.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Do we look at the dynamics?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Do we see how our profit grows,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
how our turnover grows,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
how our status rises?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
This, of course, is also assessed.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
And two more points that need to be taken into account.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
First, do you have events with key clients?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Unofficial events.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Do you have any outing meetings?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Are there any corporate parties?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Are there any general holidays?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because we understand perfectly well

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
that work is work,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
but personal relationships also need to be built.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Because it is then that trust appears,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
personal relationships appear,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
connections that cannot be replaced.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And one more point is the system of work

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
with claims of key clients.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
It must be a worked-out business process

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
that clearly tells you

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
how you should act

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
in case of a claim of a client.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
We will look at it in addition.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
And another block is project management.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Do you have joint projects with key clients?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
We assess.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Next, how is the work with these projects going?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Is the expectation of efficiency

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
in working with these projects assessed?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Is the assessment of the profitability

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
of these projects carried out?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
All these factors are included

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
in the project management block.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
When you look at this method in your workbook,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
you will be able to assess

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
the client-orientedness of your company

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
and check.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
There will be all the decoding.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
We talked about control,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
because without control we do not understand

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
the effectiveness of our work.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That is why I would like to give you

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
the main indicators

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
that you can choose from the entire list

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
for control of key clients.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Maybe you will not take all of them

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
as indicators of efficiency,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
but you can choose some of them

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
and apply them in your work.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
What are these indicators?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
The first is the number of clients.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Including new clients,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
that is, not necessarily key,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
we are looking at the client base now,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and the growth rate.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
It is not a secret that

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
the clients are rotated.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Someone leaves, someone comes.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
We need to understand

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
the stability of our client base.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
The next point is the volume of sales

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
for clients,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
including in the segment.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Remember we said that

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
each segment can have its key clients.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Therefore, here we are evaluating

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
in this section.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Next, the number of permanent clients.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
How many of them are there?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
How many of them are significant?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
We also look at how the indicator

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
grows from period to period.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
For example, the number of significant

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
clients increases or, on the contrary,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
decreases.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Then this is an alarming signal.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Naturally, you have to take some measures.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
The next point, which is very interesting

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
in the assessment, is the volume of

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
unpaid funds or unpaid profits.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
We evaluate and add up all the contracts

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
that have collapsed for some reason.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
We look at how much

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
we have not received the funds.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
The dynamics of this indicator

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
is very important

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
because it should naturally decrease

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
if we work with key clients.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
The next point is the average time

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
of signing a contract.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
We said that when we work with key clients,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
the time for operational activity decreases.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Therefore, of course, this indicator

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
should also decrease.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
If this happens, then our work

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
is moving in the right direction.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
The client loyalty index

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
is based on the market clients,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
on the dynamics of their changes,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
and so on.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
We have already looked at the client loyalty index.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
You can easily assess this indicator.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
The next point is the specific weight

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
of the temporarily completed orders

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
to the total number of orders.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
It is not a secret that we can receive an order,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
but we do not have any assortment.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
We cannot fulfill this order now.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
We either postpone it,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
if the client is waiting,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
then we postponed and completed the order,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
or if the client cannot wait,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
even if he is very loyal to us,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
he goes to another client,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
to our competitor,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
and we risk losing him.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Therefore, it is very important

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
to see how the orders

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
that have been received

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
are temporarily fulfilled.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The number of clients' complaints.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
If you are working with key clients,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
this indicator should also decrease.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
The next point is the number

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
of complaints from clients.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
This indicator should decrease.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Another point is the average

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
duration of the work.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
This is from the first contact

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
with a new client

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
to the completion of the client.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
How long does it take?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
This indicator should also decrease.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
If it decreases,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
it shows that your company

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
is working more efficiently.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
The average time for coordination

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
of questions between departments.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
This indicator is for the internal company,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
for key clients.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
The less signatures,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
the less interference in the activity,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
the faster we make the order,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
work more clearly with key clients,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and receive less complaints.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Therefore, this is also

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
one of the good indicators

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
that characterizes the activity

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
of your company and its success.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Another indicator is the financial one.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
This indicator can be evaluated

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
if you have a management accounting system.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Because you need to pay

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
all the costs to key clients.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Here you can see

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
the optimization of all costs

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
and benefits you get

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
from working with key clients.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
This is the rotation of the client base,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
the growth of income,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
the reduction of operating costs,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
the additional price bonus

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
you receive.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
These indicators are determined.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
If you have a management accounting system,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
it is not difficult to evaluate them.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I would like to say

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
that, of course,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
when working with key clients,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
the function and role of the key client manager

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
is very important.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Many companies

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
now create departments

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
with so-called

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
key account managers.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
These are key client managers.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Those who work on the FMCG market

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
are usually network managers.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Because the network is a very serious client

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
where you cannot miss any deadlines

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
because you will be fined

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
immediately.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You cannot change the assortment.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
There are very serious business processes.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
And, of course, companies

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
do it on their own,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
not through intermediaries.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
They select key managers

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
who would ensure the control

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
and execution of all actions

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
that are necessary

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
to ensure effective

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
work with key clients.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I want to discuss

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
the functions of these managers.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
What should they do

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
and how should they work?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
The first thing I want to say

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
is the data base management.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Any manager's activity

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
starts with data base management.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
There is even a saying

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
that a sales manager

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
costs as much as his data base.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
This is the main asset

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
of any manager.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
It is a pity that not everyone

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
understands this.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
But in fact, it is a very important indicator.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
The first thing a key client manager

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
should do

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
is to create a database.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
The indicators we collect

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
from clients are being developed.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
All the information about clients,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
key people,

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
the assortment they deal with,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
their preferences,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
their capabilities,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
their development.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
The bigger your database,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
the better your key client manager will work.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
There is a book

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
by Harvey McKay

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
called How to Survive Among Sharks.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Harvey McKay

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
offers

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
66 questions

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
in the book

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
that should be put into the client database.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Only then it will work effectively.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
He tells

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
how to work

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
with key clients.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
It is a very important and interesting book.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I recommend you to read it.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Maybe you won't choose all the 66 questions,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
but some of them

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
should definitely get into your database.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
The next point,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
the next function of a key client manager

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
is, of course,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
selection of a nomenclature

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
or assortment for a key client.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Here you need to consider the specificity of the client,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
his price category

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
in which he offers the product,

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
his experience of working in the market,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
his preferences in a given region.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
There may be

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
some special preferences in the assortment.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
It occurs in most products and goods.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Therefore,

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
the function of a manager

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
is to adjust the assortment

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
to the client's requirements, to the client's wishes.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Not just to sell

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
what we need, but to see

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
what the client wants and, of course,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
to form this assortment.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
To form it taking into account the profitability,

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
taking into account the turnover, and so on.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Of course, taking into account the interests of the companies,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
but also taking into account the interests of our key client.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
The next point

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
is planning and ordering the assortment.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
You know, key clients

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
take a big turn.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
If we do not worry in advance,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
do not make an order,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
our supply department may simply not deliver it.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
The client has received the order,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
there is no product in the warehouse,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
the client leaves.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Therefore, a clear and clear

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
system of orders is necessary.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
For a certain time,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
that is, a business process is scheduled,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
and the manager should have a red flag

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
and say that there will be an order,

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
you need to see if there will be such an amount of the assortment,

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
and so on.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
This is also one of its basic functions.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Further. Forming a sales forecast.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Of course, together with the key client.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Not just that I sat and thought,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
let's sell this much.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Be sure to consult

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
with the key client.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
What is he planning?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
What are his development plans?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Where does he want to offer this assortment?

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Why is this particular assortment

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
of goods interesting to him?

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
And in what volume and what batches

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
is he going to buy it?

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
This often happens

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
before the planning period.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
When we form our sales forecast,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
then we communicate

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
with our key clients.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
And in fact,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
key clients are the basis

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
of the sales forecast.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
These 20% of clients

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
that form 80% of the turnover.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Therefore, it is very important for us

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
to understand, prescribe and agree.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Then the client will not feel

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
that the plan is imposed on him.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
And he is simply forced,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
forced to fulfill this plan.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
He will understand that he agrees with him.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
He gave himself a report

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
on what decisions he made.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And the plan will be much easier to fulfill.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
And the motivation will be stronger.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Because this is his decision too.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
The next important point.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
The offer for the price of education.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Of course, you can often understand

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
that the clients,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
because they take a lot of turns,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
they try to impose their conditions on us.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
But of course,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
we take into account their interests

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
and our own.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Through negotiations,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
we reach a common opinion.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Maybe a compromise.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Maybe we come to some decision.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
But the price offer

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
is a very important point.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Because here the discount works.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Here we immediately get the result

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
on the marginal income

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
taking into account all the costs.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
This is the financial result of the company.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
One of the main reasons

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
why we work for profit.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Therefore, the price offer

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
is formed by the manager

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
according to the key clients.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
He agrees with the key client.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
And then this offer is already approved

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
or changed in some way

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
at the level of the general director

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
of your company.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Another important point.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
This is the planning of the promotional campaign.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
There are marketologists,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
there are brand managers,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
there are someone else

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
who is engaged in the development of promotional campaigns.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
But only the manager

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
according to the key clients

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
can agree on the action

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
that will really give an effect.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Because maybe there is some specificity

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
in the region.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Some action does not go there at all,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
but will go to another type of action.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
And of course, you need to take into account

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
the specificity of the region,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
the specificity of the industry,

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
the specificity of the client.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
And taking into account this,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
to coordinate the time,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
the idea of ​​the promotion,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
the budget for it.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
All this is the responsibility

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
of the key client,

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
or rather the manager according to the key clients.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
To coordinate the work with the key client

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
on the promotion of various promotions

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
in support of our products.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
The control of the client's merchandising standards.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
This is the same as in the fast-food market

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
or in the fast-food market.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Where you need to develop a plan,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
merchandising standards,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
make a very clear spread

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
so that your product is noticed,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
seen and bought.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
What I want to say here.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
We can impose our standards in the same way.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
But maybe there is some specificity

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
of the retail industry

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
that we do not know.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Maybe we were not in this region.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
For example, if you take

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
the city of Khabarovsk,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
then there is the biggest turnover

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
of retail stores

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
in the category C.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
In the case of the shop trade.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Compare it with St. Petersburg,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
for example.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Not even with Moscow,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
but with St. Petersburg.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
A completely different situation.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
There is a major turnover

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
of stores in the category A, B.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
And the network, of course.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
We don't even consider the network.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And, of course,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
there will be different strategies of work

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
in different regions.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
And different assortment,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
including different merchandising standards.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Because we can't put an infinite number

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
of products on the shelf of a small store.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
That is why the function of the manager

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
on key customers

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
is to coordinate this important issue.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
When do we get new products?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Or suddenly there is some problem.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The product is out of date,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
it needs to be sold.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
We form a proposal with the key customer.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
What to do with it?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
How to promote a new product?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
How to present it better?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
How to position it better?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Where to offer it better?

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
At what point of sale?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
And if it is a problematic product

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
that needs to be sold,

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
we agree with our actions

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
with our key customers.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
They help us by sharing their experience.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And they say, do it this way.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
We have already done it.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
We have not made any losses.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And by the moment of agreement

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
we make

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
certain decisions.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Another main function

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
of the manager on key customers

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
is a presentation

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
to the customer of our new product.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Of course, a manager should have

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
the skills of presenting.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Because we should clearly show

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
what our customer wins,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
why he should buy

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
our new product,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
why he should test it

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
on this market.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
He should collect such information

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
as feedback.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Therefore, the presentation

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
of a new product to a customer

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
is a function of a manager

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
on key customers.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
And it often happens that a manager

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
goes to his key customer,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
gathers his clients,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
and there he holds a presentation,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
tells them about the advantages

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
and advantages of our product.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And it works very well.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Therefore,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
the skills of presentation

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
are necessary skills for such a qualified person.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Another important point.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Maybe it is

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
auxiliary, but important.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
It is the formation of reserves

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
for pre-orders.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Imagine a holiday.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
For example, before the New Year,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
when there is not enough product,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
when everything goes to waste,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
when sales volume

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
grows by 200%,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
in some categories of products by 250%.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
What do we get?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
We get a deficit.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
So,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
a key customer manager

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
must control

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
a certain reserve

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
of products for his key customer.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
So that

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
key customers do not run out of products.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
It is they who make more turnover.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It is on them that we save

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
our costs.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
And what's the point if we give our products

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
to small customers

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
and get nothing in return?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It is a completely different thing

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
when we give preferences

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
to key customers.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
And this is very important.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
The next function is to track contract terms.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
As you know, a contract is

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
for a certain period of time.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
It is not temporary.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
It can be for a year,

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
for two, for three.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
A key customer manager

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
must track

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
the terms of the contract,

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
and understand

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
when it ends

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
so that before the end

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
he can review all the terms,

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
talk to the client,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
agree, approve,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
and sign a new contract

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
before the end of the contract

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
with the key customer.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Or he can sign a prolongation agreement

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
if the terms do not change.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It often happens in companies

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
that there are many key customers

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
or they are not paid much attention

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
to them.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
And they just

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
forgot to look at the contract.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
The contract ended today

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
to conclude a new one.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
It is necessary to have time.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
And we miss

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
our delivery opportunities.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
There is no contract, no sale.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Therefore,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
it is important to track

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
the terms of the contract

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
and the business process

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
how to agree and sign

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
everything before the end of the contract.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
By the way,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
every key customer manager

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
must know

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
the date

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
when the contract ends

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
and the key customer manager

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
must know

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
the date when the contract ends.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
It is a good key customer manager.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
The moment of operational work

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
is not important.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It is just a technical sale.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Contract, account,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
deposit,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
delivery schedule,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
payment schedule,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
budget planning.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
All this operational activity

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
is not taken off the key manager.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
He does it all

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
according to his clients

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
and, preferably,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
according to the business process.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
One of the important points

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
of the contract is

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
the continuation of relations

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
between the key manager

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
and the key customer manager.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
This is necessary

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
to understand

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
what the key customer

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
is interested in

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
and what he can discuss

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
with him.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
It is necessary

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
to find common interests

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
and to find a reason

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
to share some news

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
about the victory of our football team

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
or the victory of our biathlonists.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
It is necessary to understand

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
what the client is interested in

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
and to develop relations in this direction.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
There are two main functions.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
The first one is

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
to process the claims of the clients.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Who, as a key customer manager,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
will process the claims

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
or control the processing?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
The key customer manager

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
will process the claims

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
and will control the process

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
to satisfy the claims.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
This is a very important point

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
without which the clients

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
will leave you.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Another point

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
is to decide

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
what to do next

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
with the key customers

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
and what suggestions

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
the manager can make.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
He is a high-ranking manager

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
and he has to make suggestions

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
on the development of relations

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
with the key customers.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
What ideas does he have?

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
What does he propose?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Why does he propose it?

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
What funds are needed for this?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
And what result do we plan to get?

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
We have discussed the functions

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
of a key customer manager.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
He is a mini-manager of a company

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
because he has a lot of functions.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
And there are such functions.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
He has

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
the authority

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
to make decisions

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
with our most important clients.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
And if the company is stable,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
he is a mini-manager.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And he has to be positioned

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
with the same responsibility

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
and the same results.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Let's look at

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
the scheme of working with claims.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Such a scheme

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
or business process

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
should be registered in each company.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Regardless of whether you work

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
with a key client

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
in a special way or not.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
But for a key client

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
it is the most important parameter

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
because they should feel

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
your feedback

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
to understand

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
that their problems are being solved.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Where does such a scheme of work begin?

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Of course, with a claim.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Here it is.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Here it is.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
What to do with it?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
The first thing a key client manager

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
should do is to ask questions

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
and understand what the problem is.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
He should inform the client

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
that he has a procedure

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
and that he has two days

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
to consider and make a decision.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And in four days

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
he will get the result.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
The client should not worry

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
and think whether he was accepted

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
or not.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
The next thing is

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
that the manager

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
looks at the problem

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
and starts to cooperate

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
with other companies.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
If it is a logistic problem,

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
he should work with logistics.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
If it is a financial problem,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
he should work with financial structure.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
The problem is related to the company

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
and the manager

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
should contact the company.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
He starts to find out

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
whether the problem is being solved

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
or not.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
If the problem is not solved

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
and the situation is not working out,

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
then a standard procedure

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
is launched

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
in the company.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
How do we react to this problem?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Maybe we return the money.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Maybe we accept the return of the goods

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
and apologize.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Maybe we offer some services

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
for free as a bonus

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
so that the client does not worry

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
and understands that we reacted to his claim

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
and although we cannot do anything with it,

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
some measures are taken.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
This is the first option.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
If we have a solution,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
we solve the problem.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
We change the goods,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
pay the bills,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
and so on,

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
we eliminate the problem.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
When we have done all this,

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
the next step is to document

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
everything that happened,

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
what was the claim,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
whether it was solved or not,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
how it happened,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
who was involved in this problem,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
why it occurred,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
how they reacted.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
This is a separate database

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
that allows you

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
to analyze these things

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and make decisions

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
and not make repeated mistakes.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
This is especially important.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
We are given experience

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
not to make repeated mistakes.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Therefore, it is necessary to document the process.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
When the analysis is completed,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
it is sent to the companies

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
that were involved

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
in solving this problem.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
This is necessary

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
so that each unit

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
understands its responsibility

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
and does not shift it.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It is necessary to understand

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
how to act next time

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
so that such a problem does not occur again.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
If the problem is not solved,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
it is not solved because

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
the company does not have the opportunity,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
but because the procedure is not prescribed

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and no one needs anything in the company.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Then we either change

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
or create a new procedure.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Otherwise,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
you simply will not be able

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
to work with key clients.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
As with all other problems,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
any clients must be satisfied,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
but the key ones

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
should be in the first place.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I would like to tell you

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
one more important point

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
that I think will be important for you.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
How to plan work

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
with key clients?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
We found out the advantages,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
we looked at the main functions,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
how to plan this work.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The first is, of course,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
the client profile or database

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
that we make.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
We must understand

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
what will be in this database,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
who will work on it,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
who will supplement,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
who will analyze, and so on.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It can be not only key clients,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
but also marketologists,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
analysts who add information

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
and managers who work on the market

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
if this information concerns

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
our key clients.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Therefore,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
many people can be involved

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
in the creation of this database,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
but the base holder must be one.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Then we assess

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
the current situation.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Remember,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
we conducted a test

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
on client-orientedness.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You can assess

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
how you work with this company

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
by this test.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
We assessed it by the satisfaction matrix,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
and we concluded

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
how interesting it is

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
for both you and the client

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
what you lose and win,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and assessed your pros and cons.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
The next stage is

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
how you work with the people

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
who make decisions

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
or influence the decision-making.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
This also needs to be assessed

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
and understood.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Do you congratulate them on their birthday

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
or on professional holidays?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Do you call them

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
to talk about life?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
You should have

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
not only professional relations.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Therefore,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
you should analyze

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
the situation of this subject.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
When you have done the analysis,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
you have the whole picture in your hands.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
You can see

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
what is happening to your key client.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
After that, you set goals and tasks.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
What do you want to do next?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
What we discussed earlier

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
is one of the functions of a manager.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
We discussed the proposal

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
on the development of relations with clients.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Here we set goals and tasks

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
on the development of relations

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
with this client.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The goals and tasks are set.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Remember,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
they are digitized and specific.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It is desirable to achieve them

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
so that there is no demotivation.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
That is,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
such goals

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
that can be checked later

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
whether we have achieved them or not.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
The next thing we do

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
when we have set goals and tasks,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
we choose a strategy of work,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
make a plan of events,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
assign responsible people,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
consolidate this responsibility.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Because not only a key client manager

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
can be involved in this work.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
A manager is like a coordinator,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
like a mini-manager,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
and then

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
completely different categories

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
of company employees

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
can be involved,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
and can help in one or another process.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
When a new product is released,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
brand managers, marketologists,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
when financing and budgeting

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
the finance department,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
when it comes to delivery,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
logistics,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
and so on.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Therefore,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
such a plan is created,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
it is approved,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
it is agreed with the client,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and the work begins.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I would like to say

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
that in the end

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
control is necessary,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
as in any work.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
You have planned the work,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
it is a stage of planning.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But control is necessary.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And it is necessary not only

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
in the end, but also in the intermediate period,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
so that you

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
constantly keep your hand on the pulse,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
so that you see how your relations develop,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
so that it does not happen

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
that at the end of the period

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
you say,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I could not do it.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Therefore,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
control is necessary.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
In conclusion,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I would like to draw your attention

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
to who you need to cooperate with

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and communicate with

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
in the company of key clients,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
who are the key figures in making decisions,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
who are they.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You have a scheme on the slide.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
The first thing we pay attention to

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
is the person making the decision.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
These are company managers,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
commercial directors,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
general directors,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
purchasing directors,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
if there are companies,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
then he can make decisions.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
We identify the main people,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
we list their list,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
contact phones,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and everything that is necessary

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
on the basis of data.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
The next group of people

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
is the people who influence the decision.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Remember we said

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
that there should be contact groups

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
who can recommend,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
not recommend.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
The contact person

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
who influences the decision

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
can be the company's guardian,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
maybe he is the father of the manager.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
He can easily

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
advise him something.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
If he has an influence

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
on the decision of his son,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
it is very easy.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The main thing here is to identify

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
who this person is,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
who can help him to talk to him,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
to convince him.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
There are three more categories of employees

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
or people who can help

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
to make decisions.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
They are the people

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
who influence the decision.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
The users of the products and services.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
They can recommend,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
not recommend,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
want or not want to buy

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
this product.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
The purchasing manager.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
He may not even be a director,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
but he can help you to talk to him.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
You can't do anything,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
you have to find another contact person.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Including the financial staff.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Why?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Because the financial staff

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
gives restrictions

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
that the purchasing manager

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
is guided by.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Therefore, whether you want it or not,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
indirectly or directly,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
the financial staff naturally

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
also influences the decision.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Therefore, the recommendation is

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
to consider as many people as possible.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Try to make contacts with them.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Moreover, informal contacts.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Both formal and informal.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
In order to have the opportunity

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
to influence

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
the activity of your key client.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I want to say

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
that when contacts are not only

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
formal, the client can forgive you

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
a shortcoming,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
increase in price,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
and not react so quickly.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Because you

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
are practically a friend.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
That's why

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
key clients are so

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
profitable, so attractive

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
for us, they give us such a turn,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
such a profit.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
That's why the strategy

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
called the client-oriented strategy

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
leads the company

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
to great success.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I would like to say in conclusion

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
that today we have considered

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
several topics

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
when it comes to finding your client.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
The first thing we considered

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
is segmentation, because it helps

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
us to select our target segments.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
The next thing we did

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
was to select

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
important clients,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
just important, by matrix.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Then we selected key clients

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
and considered

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
how it is desirable

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
to build a work with key clients

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
so that it, of course,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
affects the company's result,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
the financial result

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
of your company.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Thank you for your attention.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I wish you success.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Be client-oriented and grow in your business.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
All the best. Goodbye.
