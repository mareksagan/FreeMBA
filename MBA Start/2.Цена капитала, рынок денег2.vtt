00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The second part of the question is about the price of financial resources.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
The top manager should know the price of financial resources for his company for the following reasons.

00:13.000 --> 00:23.000
The first is that the price of the capital is the return on investment by investors in the company's activities.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
The manager should anticipate possible changes in the price of shares depending on the expected return on investment and dividends.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
In the first part of the question we discussed the situation of the price of the company's own capital.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
The company can use both its own and borrowed capital as speculative capital.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
It can buy shares at a low price and sell them at a high price after receiving positive dividends.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
The second reason is the price of borrowed capital.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
The price of borrowed capital is associated with the interest paid.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
Therefore, it is necessary to choose the best option out of several options to attract investors.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
If we look at the current situation of the financial market in Russia,

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
we can see that the interest rate in the currency is 5-6%.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
However, banks say that you should borrow money from the bank.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
Banks say that you should borrow money from the bank.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
This is due to the fact that these currencies are very conservative and do not change the rate in the least.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
The interest rate in the currency is 5-6%.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
Therefore, the top manager should assume that the price of the borrowed resources is associated with the interest paid.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
The manager responsible for the loan policy of the company should propose solutions related to the best possible outcome.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
The manager responsible for the loan policy of the company should propose solutions related to the best possible outcome.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
The price of financial resources is one of the key factors in the analysis of investment projects and planning of the company's financial budget.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
The price of money varies over different periods of time.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
In 2005-2006, the average price of $1 million was $28.70.

03:30.000 --> 03:38.000
This is not comparable to the current $1 million.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
The average price of $1 million was $28.70.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
The average price of $1 million was $28.70.

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
This is the decrease in the result of the work of the Central Bank of Russia in 2007.

04:02.000 --> 04:18.000
The main point is that the benefits of borrowing from one currency and the disadvantages of borrowing from another currency should be associated with the interest rates and the currency exchange rate.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
We consider foreign currencies as alternatives.

04:26.000 --> 04:42.000
The factors related to the purchase of new equipment and the launch of new production, the promotion of the foreign market and the production of our own products should be taken into account.

04:42.000 --> 04:56.000
If we consider the company's financial budget, we should take into account the interest rate and the sources of borrowing.

04:56.000 --> 05:10.000
The following slide shows the information on how the Central Bank's refinancing rate of the Russian Federation changed from 2002 to 2007.

05:10.000 --> 05:24.000
To summarize the state of the Central Bank's refinancing rate, we see that it fell from 25% to 10% on June 19, 2007.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
The rate depends on the level of inflation in the country.

05:30.000 --> 05:56.000
This is an achievement of the authorities and the regulatory body of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, which provides a corresponding rate for commercial borrowing resources provided by non-financial organizations on the Russian market.

05:56.000 --> 06:10.000
Today, on average, the Central Bank's loan rate of Russian enterprises is somewhere around 2% of the Central Bank's base rate.

06:10.000 --> 06:30.000
In terms of the value of the company's financial resources, we are focusing on the Central Bank's base rate, which indicates what will happen to the price of these resources in the next period.

06:30.000 --> 06:58.000
In the case of a change in the Central Bank's refinancing rate, the borrower has the right to claim a reduction in the interest rate,

06:58.000 --> 07:08.000
and the bank has the right to increase the loan rate provided to the client in the case of an increase in the Central Bank's rate.

07:08.000 --> 07:25.000
The following slide shows the actual information of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the loan rates of non-financial organizations, i.e. Russian enterprises, in 2007.

07:25.000 --> 07:42.000
We see that the base rate remains at 9.5%, 10.1%, 10.2%, which is approximately the same as the Central Bank's rate.

07:42.000 --> 08:00.000
Commercial banks resell the resources they attract from the open financial markets, primarily private depositors, at a 4-5% rate to non-financial organizations.

08:00.000 --> 08:16.000
The dynamics are such that the money we deposit in banks can only be saved, but not multiplied.

08:16.000 --> 08:36.000
The interest rate we have today does not even reach the level of inflation that exists in the country today, but at least minimizes the losses, which can be made if we accumulate the money and do not place it at risk.

08:36.000 --> 08:46.000
Of course, for the current activities of enterprises, the acceptable rates, and these interest rates can already be considered acceptable,

08:46.000 --> 09:01.000
if we consider the situation in 1995, when the Central Bank's rate was 210%, all credit resources were usually equated to the dollar equivalent or allocated in currency.

09:01.000 --> 09:18.000
The rates we see today in the financial market allow companies to plan their activities more effectively, with less risk to direct the resources attracted,

09:18.000 --> 09:30.000
and increase the turnover of the enterprise, and are certainly an effective support for the development of the business of the company.

09:30.000 --> 09:44.000
The next slide shows the average interest rates of commercial banks on loans to non-financial organizations and the population in the US dollar.

09:45.000 --> 09:57.000
We see that the dollar rate for non-financial organizations is somewhat lower, on average, by 1%, than the dollar equivalent.

09:57.000 --> 10:20.000
But again, if we compare the situation with the past, then 210% of annual interest in rubles and about 15-18% in currency were credited at that time in the dollar equivalent of commercial banks.

10:21.000 --> 10:45.000
We see a positive trend. The ruble is strengthening its position, becoming a stable national currency, and today, according to experts, the dollar amount of the population is less than $90 billion.

10:46.000 --> 10:55.000
This is a rather modest figure compared to what the population of our country had before.

10:55.000 --> 11:11.000
It turns out that the dollar is gradually being washed out and is used only as a means of calculation, or as a calculation for everyday needs of the wealthy category of citizens.

11:12.000 --> 11:24.000
In 2007, the population of commercial banks in the US dollar was credited with an average of 12.5%-13.3%.

11:25.000 --> 11:41.000
This is the most common price of credit resources that can be used to attract companies to the economy or to meet the needs of the private sector in Russia.

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
It is the Central Bank's rate that determines the commercial rates for loans in rubles and US dollars for the national economy.

11:53.000 --> 12:14.000
Another promising way to attract additional financial resources to the company's total capital, as well as to the company's debt, is to place corporate debt.

12:15.000 --> 12:27.000
How effective is this option? First of all, the company is focused on diversifying options for attracting financial resources.

12:27.000 --> 12:50.000
On the other hand, it is potentially ready to give a certain amount of transparency to the company's business operations, so that the debtors are sure that the debtor's risk is acceptable and that the debtor will be able to pay off his debt.

12:51.000 --> 13:00.000
The slide shows the characteristics of how to place corporate debt.

13:00.000 --> 13:12.000
In particular, it is supposed to be useful to attract consultants who can provide support in two main areas.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
First of all, legal experts who register and issue documents to the Federal Financial Markets Service.

13:21.000 --> 13:35.000
The second group of consultants are specialists from investment and banking units of large banks who are familiar with the standards of requests of investors in the stock market for issued bonds.

13:35.000 --> 13:57.000
They can not only help the company prepare for the issuance of corporate bonds, but also determine the most profitable and acceptable time period for entering the stock market with the proposal of their own debt obligations for sale.

13:57.000 --> 14:23.000
The next group of consultants is the underwriter, that is, the fund intermediary who helps the issuer of the bonds.

14:23.000 --> 14:38.000
The underwriter is a participant in the trading on a particular exchange. According to the contract with the issuer, he issues securities on behalf of the issuer at the request of the client.

14:38.000 --> 14:58.000
The underwriter offers the securities to the RTS or MMVB fund and sells them on behalf of the RTS or MMVB fund.

14:58.000 --> 15:12.000
In Russian practice, there are rare cases when a pool or a group of underwriters consists of three or four investment banks that organize the placement together.

15:12.000 --> 15:36.000
This increases the size of the commission. On the other hand, the pool of underwriters is a guarantee or a positive recommendation for the stock market, when a serious company with a good business reputation offers debt obligations to a particular issuer.

15:36.000 --> 15:56.000
The choice of an underwriter is one of the most important stages in the preparation of the issuance of corporate bonds, because it is necessary not to make a mistake and take into account the experience of the current players of the underwriting market.

15:56.000 --> 16:18.000
If we consider the results of the work in Russia in 2006, 11 billion dollars were allocated to corporate bonds and corporate shares that were placed on the Russian funding platforms.

16:18.000 --> 16:46.000
The company Troika Dialog is the leader in this regard. The underwriting characteristics are listed in the slide.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
The underwriting characteristics are listed in the slide.

17:16.000 --> 17:40.000
The underwriting characteristics are listed in the slide.

17:40.000 --> 17:55.000
The auction order is assumed to determine the price of the bonds, which allows companies that imitate corporate bonds to attract resources at a more optimal market price.

17:55.000 --> 18:21.000
The slide shows a link to the Russian trading system exchange, where you can familiarize yourself with the list of trading participants and conduct a selection analysis of the industry or the size of the business of those companies that imitated corporate bonds.

18:21.000 --> 18:50.000
The slide shows a link to the Russian trading system exchange, where you can familiarize yourself with the list of trading participants and conduct a selection analysis of the industry or the size of the business of those companies that imitated corporate bonds.

18:51.000 --> 19:08.000
The threshold level of profitability and net profit for a company should be at least 20 million dollars per year.

19:08.000 --> 19:26.000
In this case, we say that the effect of the scale can be achieved.

19:26.000 --> 19:54.000
In this case, we say that the effect of the scale can be achieved.

19:56.000 --> 20:24.000
The next slide shows the approximate price level, which is shown in the following slide.

20:24.000 --> 20:53.000
The next slide shows the approximate price level, which is shown in the following slide.

20:54.000 --> 21:06.000
The financial director must take into account that a bank transaction is closed and regulated only by contractual relations between the borrower and the bank.

21:06.000 --> 21:17.000
At the same time, the company can get a lot of indirect benefits if it chooses to place corporate bonds.

21:17.000 --> 21:31.000
This is due to the fact that most investors who consider the feasibility of placing their free financial resources in corporate bonds will familiarize themselves with the state of the company's business,

21:31.000 --> 21:53.000
and will recommend to their clients to buy these bonds or to buy these bonds on their behalf.

22:23.000 --> 22:51.000

37:35.000 --> 37:56.000
The next slide shows the approximate price level, which is shown in the following slide.

37:57.000 --> 38:14.000
To sum up, the debt capital is valuable, primarily for the maintenance of one's debt.

38:14.000 --> 38:23.000
If we work with credit organizations, it is connected with the payment of interest to the banks that maintain our debt.

38:23.000 --> 38:48.000
If we work with corporate securities, it is connected with the payment of interest to the banks that maintain our debt.

38:48.000 --> 39:02.000
Depending on the volume of the assets, and the size of the business, one can choose a form of attracting the debt.

39:02.000 --> 39:17.000
The threshold value is $20 million in net profit.

39:17.000 --> 39:37.000
If we have a chance to declare a net profit of more than $20 million, we will be able to do so.

39:37.000 --> 40:05.000
If we have a chance to declare a net profit of more than $20 million, we will be able to do so.

40:05.000 --> 40:33.000
If we have a chance to declare a net profit of more than $20 million, we will be able to do so.

40:33.000 --> 40:45.000
If we have a chance to declare a net profit of more than $20 million, we will be able to do so.

40:45.000 --> 41:06.000
The third part of the questions is about the money market.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I want to draw your attention to the following slide.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
There is an assertion that money is a commodity.

41:12.000 --> 41:18.000
Depending on the macroeconomic conditions, the cost of money can be different.

41:19.000 --> 41:27.000
At the same time, we can cite historical examples.

41:27.000 --> 41:35.000
In post-war Germany, the inflation rate was up to 20,000% per year.

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
The money was issued in huge quantities, mainly in weight.

41:41.000 --> 41:52.000
There were cases when people left their money carts outside to go to the store and to look at the prices.

41:52.000 --> 42:03.000
When they left the store, the money was on the roadside, and someone privatized or expropriated the cart.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
This is hyperinflationary economy.

42:06.000 --> 42:18.000
It is clear that in a crisis, if the state is forced to issue additional debt,

42:18.000 --> 42:32.000
the banknotes will increase the inflation rate, and the level of commercial loans will increase.

42:32.000 --> 42:39.000
If the central bank's base rate increases, the base rate of commercial loans increases,

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
and the chain reaction to increase the price of goods and services begins.

42:46.000 --> 42:52.000
At the same time, financial instruments are looking for a more stable base.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
This is expressed in stable foreign currencies.

42:56.000 --> 43:06.000
Therefore, the main factors that determine the cost of money are inflation and the state of the national economy.

43:07.000 --> 43:14.000
The following slide shows three main reasons for the growth of the stock market as a source of financing in Russia.

43:14.000 --> 43:23.000
First of all, we highlight the growth of international investment ratings in Russia, Russian issuers and their debt instruments.

43:23.000 --> 43:33.000
The stability of the economy over the past six years allows Western large investors to be convinced,

43:34.000 --> 43:46.000
and, first of all, conservative investors who invest in state-owned debt, that the stability of the economy will continue.

43:46.000 --> 43:53.000
A stable level of oil prices allows forecasting the future profit of the Russian budget,

43:53.000 --> 43:59.000
and this means that the Russian economy is becoming extremely investment attractive.

44:00.000 --> 44:08.000
Today, American investors invest dollars in the Russian economy.

44:08.000 --> 44:15.000
The dollar is devalued, but is currently converted into rubles.

44:15.000 --> 44:24.000
In addition to the declared profitability of the stock market, on average, 20-30% per annum,

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
Western foreign investors receive additional income from the devaluation of the dollar.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
The euro is in a different situation.

44:35.000 --> 44:44.000
The euro is in a more conservative position, and even the exchange rate for the ruble is increasing.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
On average, the euro is in the 34-35 range.

44:51.000 --> 45:03.000
Therefore, the Russian stock market is a proposal of foreign financial resources for the development of the Russian economy.

45:03.000 --> 45:17.000
This is why 2006 was the year of the highest foreign investments in Russia, and, according to estimates, is worth $40-50 billion per year.

45:18.000 --> 45:32.000
At this rate, no economy in the world is growing, and if this trend persists for the next two or three years,

45:32.000 --> 45:38.000
it can be said that the Russian economy has become the most investment attractive in the world.

45:39.000 --> 45:47.000
This automatically means a reduction in the cost of foreign investment in Russia.

45:47.000 --> 45:57.000
The second objective factor is the reduction of risks and the growth of the level of trust of domestic and international investors in debt.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
Today, there are practically no corporate defaults on debt obligations,

46:03.000 --> 46:15.000
and the market reacts very clearly to the reduction of prices on financial resources due to the market's quality characteristics.

46:15.000 --> 46:21.000
In other words, when debt obligations are imitated by conscientious borrowers,

46:21.000 --> 46:31.000
there is an opportunity to work at an acceptable level of profitability at the required high-quality level of borrowers.

46:31.000 --> 46:41.000
2005 is considered the year of the initial stage of the Russian debt market's exit to a new level of quality,

46:41.000 --> 46:49.000
precisely because foreign potential has entered the Russian trading platforms,

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
and Russian companies have gained access to foreign financial resources.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
The next slide shows the main trends of the securities market.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
It can be predicted that this trend will persist for the next three years.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
First, there is a rapid increase in the number of emissions.

47:09.000 --> 47:18.000
We are currently witnessing a very rapid and systematic centralization of various groups of companies.

47:18.000 --> 47:26.000
We are seeing the increase in shareholder capital not only due to the current activities of individual companies,

47:26.000 --> 47:34.000
but also due to the voluntary purchase of individual companies.

47:34.000 --> 47:41.000
In addition, we are clearly seeing an increase in the average volume of one emission.

47:41.000 --> 47:49.000
Today, the average volume of an emission is about 1 billion rubles.

47:49.000 --> 47:59.000
This is when companies place bonds or carry out additional shares in this volume.

47:59.000 --> 48:07.000
This indicates that the quality and volume of resources attracted to one conditional issuer is increasing.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
In addition, we are seeing a decrease in the cost of entering the long-term investment market,

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
which is due to the fact that the largest underwriters are entering the game.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
Through their subsidiary companies or direct participation in the institutional capital of other underwriters,

48:23.000 --> 48:31.000
they are implementing a certain damping policy in the area of pricing for obtaining a certain client field.

48:31.000 --> 48:38.000
In the future, the cost of entering the long-term investment market will decrease.

48:38.000 --> 48:46.000
The following slide presents four basic financing schemes that Russian companies can use.

48:46.000 --> 48:55.000
The most popular is the traditional banking lending scheme, the second is the VEX program,

48:55.000 --> 49:01.000
the third is the bonds and the fourth is the IPO procedure.

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
Ideally, a Russian company that is focused on diversification of loans,

49:08.000 --> 49:15.000
both bank loans and corporate bonds, VEX programs,

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
should, of course, follow all four methods of attracting financing.

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
Let's take a closer look at each of them.

49:26.000 --> 49:36.000
The first is that we need to set certain criteria or signs of choosing a credit source.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
There are four basic criteria.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
First of all, the cost of financing,

49:44.000 --> 49:50.000
everything that concerns the interest rate on the debt service,

49:50.000 --> 50:00.000
and the costs of the zero cycle, when it is necessary to pay or bear the costs related to the preparation of transactions.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
The second is the term of financing.

50:03.000 --> 50:14.000
We see that the term of financing has been increasing very actively over the past five years

50:15.000 --> 50:26.000
by Russian investors and the terms of financing are becoming more and more similar to the Western standards.

50:26.000 --> 50:33.000
The third criterion is the necessary funding for attracting funds.

50:33.000 --> 50:41.000
The bond and the third party's assignment are considered the most acceptable.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
In addition, the Insurance Companies Institute works,

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
when the risks of non-return of the funds are insured.

50:51.000 --> 51:04.000
In addition, various assignments are possible from informal but organized financial groups

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
based on regional associations and associations of entrepreneurs

51:10.000 --> 51:18.000
that have corresponding funds for the development of their own members

51:18.000 --> 51:27.000
through the provision of collective guarantees under the assignment of the obligations of the separate members of such associations.

51:27.000 --> 51:33.000
The terms of financing are necessary for the organization of attracting financing as the fourth criterion.

51:33.000 --> 51:41.000
It is also evident that, on the one hand, depending on the type of financing,

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
the terms begin to acquire clearly defined characteristics.

51:47.000 --> 51:57.000
In the previous question, we considered that at least 125 days are necessary for the preparation of the issuance of corporate bonds.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
If we consider the relationship with commercial banks,

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
many companies, within the framework of financial and economic services,

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
build measurable processes of interaction with banks to obtain loans.

52:11.000 --> 52:18.000
Therefore, the terms become clear and predictable.

52:18.000 --> 52:25.000
It is possible to make a plan for the budget and the movement of money,

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
when and at what time it is necessary to start negotiations

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
in order to get the opportunity to either re-lend or not allow cash outages.

52:35.000 --> 52:43.000
The characteristics of a commercial bank loan as one of the most common financing options

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
can be distinguished by the following advantages.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
First, there are no significant overhead expenses.

52:50.000 --> 52:57.000
Since the enterprise has a balanced interaction with the service bank,

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
the bank usually knows the financial state of the borrower,

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
sees the money flows that the borrower has,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
the intensity of income and spending of funds,

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
and knows the seasonality and characteristics of the borrower's payment ability.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
In addition, the simplicity and speed of the transaction registration can be distinguished as an advantage.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
There is no requirement for the state registration of such transactions.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
That is, there is no public transaction between the credit organization and the borrower.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
What are the disadvantages?

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
First, there are small loans.

53:37.000 --> 53:44.000
This is due to the fact that the bank is limited in allocating the necessary financial resources,

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
for example, for the strategic development of the company,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
the amount of assets at the company's disposal,

53:50.000 --> 53:57.000
the turnover of financial resources that go through the account of a client in a particular bank,

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
and the amount of net profit that the borrower receives

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
and declares in the mandatory accounting for the last five dates,

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
which are first transferred to the credit committee,

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
and then to the control of the money circulation department in the commercial bank.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
That is, compared to other options for attracting financial resources,

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
the bank loan has the biggest disadvantage, namely, small loans.

54:28.000 --> 54:35.000
First of all, these restrictions are introduced for commercial banks by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation,

54:35.000 --> 54:47.000
which regulates and strictly regulates the ways of assessing the creditability of the borrower in various internal departmental instructions,

54:47.000 --> 54:53.000
as well as the attribution to various categories when determining the reserve for possible loss of assets.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
The average loan term is one year,

54:56.000 --> 55:02.000
but today banks issue longer loans.

55:02.000 --> 55:13.000
In addition, the need to pay interest payments for the maintenance of the debt can be seen as a disadvantage.

55:13.000 --> 55:19.000
In other cases, payments can be made at the end of the term,

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
or payments can be made in a quarterly manner, if we consider the mandatory loan.

55:25.000 --> 55:34.000
High interest rates, compared to what exists today in the market in alternative ways of attracting financial resources,

55:34.000 --> 55:40.000
and, of course, the need for a deposit or a third party order for the borrower,

55:40.000 --> 55:47.000
or a third party deposit for the provision of bonds to the borrower in front of the banks.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
These are the characteristics of a bank loan.

55:50.000 --> 56:04.000
But today, a bank loan is the most common and safest scheme of interaction between banks and borrowers in the market.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
The characteristics of exchange programs.

56:08.000 --> 56:18.000
The undeniable advantage is the simplicity and efficiency of attracting funds through the exchange program.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
At the same time, there is no registration of the issuance of VXLs,

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
which is the company's personal business,

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
regarding the time at which VXLs should be issued and the conditions.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
The third advantage is the absence of a limitation on the volume of the issuance.

56:37.000 --> 56:44.000
No one can regulate the volume of VXLs issued in the company, except for shareholders.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
Shareholders can determine the limit.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.000
Very often, VXLs are the preliminary stage for preparing bonds.

56:55.000 --> 57:07.000
When a VXL is transferred to the operating players of exchange trades on various fund platforms,

57:08.000 --> 57:18.000
they provide financial consultations and intermediary services, register the issuance and cancellation of VXLs,

57:18.000 --> 57:29.000
monitor the transfer notes and can say exactly when and in which organization the VXL was transferred,

57:29.000 --> 57:40.000
and simultaneously carry out verification procedures for VXL payment.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
It should be noted that VXL is a more liquid instrument than a loan,

57:46.000 --> 57:52.000
because the interaction between the VXL issuer, the company that imitated VXL,

57:53.000 --> 58:03.000
and the market has a larger circle of companies than the deal of the loaner.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
What are the disadvantages?

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
First of all, it is necessary to conduct an examination of the authenticity,

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
correctness and reliability of the transfer note chain in the VXL itself.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
It is an extremely expensive, tedious and complex procedure.

58:22.000 --> 58:29.000
At the same time, if this procedure is carried out by a financial intermediary,

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
and a financial intermediary is our future potential underwriter,

58:33.000 --> 58:44.000
that is, he looks at the undeclared and unregistered volume of the issuance of these debt obligations of a particular company,

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
he can predict what will happen to the corporate debt.

58:48.000 --> 58:56.000
In this case, this is a certain guarantee of the subsequent success of the corporate issuance of bonds.

58:56.000 --> 59:04.000
The second very important drawback that must be taken into account is that VXL is the least protected instrument.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
Since VXL is issued in a documented form,

59:09.000 --> 59:18.000
the documentation of VXL is often accompanied by a fake VXL,

59:18.000 --> 59:28.000
when VXL, by all appearances, can say that it was issued by a reliable company,

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
but at the same time it can be a beautiful fake.

59:31.000 --> 59:45.000
When the term of VXL cancellation does not coincide with the specified date in the document,

59:45.000 --> 59:56.000
when one of the mandatory signs as a condition for VXL cancellation is absent,

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
when the signatures of the first parties do not coincide, etc.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Such VXLs are called bronze VXLs.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And, of course, if we are going to issue VXLs for the outside world,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000
we need consultations and support from external experts,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and the recommendations on the issue of VXLs for the outside world

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
are based on the fact that we need a competent and reliable financial mediator.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Companies that carry out underwriting on Russian stock markets can provide us with such services.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.000
The main advantage of issuing shares is the absence of the need to pay interest.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000
By issuing shares, we voluntarily include new members of the shareholders.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And it is clear that shares do not imply paying interest for the amount of money.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Shareholders, buying shares of the company at their own risk,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
hope for the growth of the value of these shares,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and have the right to influence the decisions of the managers or the hiring team of employees of the company.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Another advantage is the absence of the need to pay interest.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Not only interest, but also the return of the money.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
If we sell shares on the free market,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
in order to return the money to the investor,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
it is possible to sell the securities to other investors,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and there is no guarantee that they will be sold at a higher price.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But there are certain disadvantages.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
The main disadvantage is the need for transparency in the company's activities.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
The disadvantage is not that openness is bad.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The disadvantage is that openness and transparency are expensive for the company.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The company must make a lot of transformations,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
certainly related to capital investments,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
in order to meet the requirements of openness and transparency.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Perhaps the second disadvantage is the deflation of capital.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000
When we get some kind of uncontrollability when holding a meeting of shareholders,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
when various points of decision-making appear,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000
which may not be comparable to the opinion of the company's management,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
may not be comparable to the opinion of the company's main shareholders,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
but by law, we must take into account the interests of the minority,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
otherwise they can paralyze the company's work through various court proceedings.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000
In addition, the third disadvantage is the need for state registration of the issuance of shares,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000
which means additional costs for specialized services of consultants

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
for the preparation of documents for the Federal Service for Financial Markets

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and the preparation of the necessary quarterly reports.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The next slide shows the main characteristics of issuing bonds.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000
In terms of benefits, we highlight the attraction of significant funds.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:44.000
A bond loan is not bound by the company's ability to determine the maximum amount of loans

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
according to the assets at its disposal.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
In this case, if the company declares its own liability for loans

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:04.000
plus the affiliated liability of shareholders and other businesses that are at the disposal of shareholders,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
it is possible to attract large amounts of third-party financing,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
which will be the basis for increasing the loan capital.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Bonds allow for a long-term loan,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and the amount of corporate bonds issued in Russia is on average 3 years.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
State securities have a life expectancy of several decades.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
If our companies had a flawless business reputation,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
they would certainly use the opportunity to borrow for a long time.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
The next slide shows the creation of a public credit history.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.000
In this case, we say that companies are obliged to meet the requirements for repaying coupons

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
or preliminary payments on bonds.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
At the same time, the information is sent to the credit bureau

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000
on how the company copes or, suddenly, fails to meet its obligations for repaying the debt.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
The absence of real insurance.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Bonds are issued without the need for any assets.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
We do not transfer bonds to real estate.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:29.000
They can be considered and used as collateral for loans in banks.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Another advantage is the ability to manage the size of the debt.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
When the company is independent or, on the order of financial intermediaries,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
can buy out its own bonds in the market,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000
thereby minimizing the amount of debt to be paid on a fixed date.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
What are the disadvantages?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
As with shares, the company's transparency is necessary.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
This means additional preparatory capital costs and the state registration of the issuance of shares,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
which is associated with the preparation of documents and the quarterly report.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And, of course, with the time required to register the volume of the issuance of securities,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
corporate bonds.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
The next slide shows the opportunities for financing for the enterprise of borrowers

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
when entering the securities market.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000
When we say that the company receives, first of all, long-term capital,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
money is always cheaper if it is long-term.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
The second moment is that the company gains publicity.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
The company becomes disciplined.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It is responsible not only for the results of the activities in front of the current shareholders,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:06.000
but also for the extended circle of shareholders or holders of corporate bonds.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
The company has the opportunity to improve its image,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.000
increase trust, and, accordingly, trust of investors will allow to perform tasks

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
to attract the necessary amount of borrowed capital

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
with less costs and less costs in the next period of time.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
This is necessary for financing the company's strategy of development.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.000
The fourth opportunity is that the company has an exit to a more developed capital market.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:48.000
This allows the company to capitalize its value, it becomes open, public,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
and, accordingly, it facilitates its exit to a more developed capital market.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:02.000
First of all, it is on the London fund platform, on the New York fund platform,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
borrowing on the fund platform in Paris.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Let's go back to the company.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
The slide shows the main requirements that the company must meet.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:23.000
First of all, the company that enters the public market must produce competitive and promising products.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It must have a highly qualified team of management.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It must have its own business model of management.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I mean all the procedures related to the organizational structure,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
the procedures related to the description of the main business processes,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the procedures related to planning, budgeting, analysis of the results,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.000
decision-making on deviations, on adjusting the company's development course,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
on changing the normative indicators for individual business processes

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
in terms of their cost and time.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000
The company must exist in the market for a long time within the framework of planned strategic development.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:22.000
The next requirement for the company is that the company's activities must be profitable.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000
This means that all the procedures related to increasing the cost of tax minimization

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
or reducing the part of the revenue from the implementation to reflect the smaller amount of revenue,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and as a result of tax reduction, the base on profits, go to the past.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The company is forced to declare all profits, and, accordingly, pay taxes on profits,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
but also demonstrate to investors that the company's performance is positive.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
The company must have a strong financial control system.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
This is primarily due to the company's qualifications and performance of the middle management level,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and means the use of the management accounting methodology, financial controlling,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
which will allow the company to control the existing cash flow.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The accounting system must be approved when the company's standards for management accounting

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and public accounting must be developed.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The last requirement is that the company must provide the financial information to the interested users,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
which is the shareholders, creditors, and possibly their employees,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000
if they are a part of the obligatory category of persons to whom the company's financial information is provided.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Not all the company's assets can be reflected in the asset complex.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000
In the next slide, we will see why the Russian accounting system does not allow

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
to provide fully reliable information about the company's financial state.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
In this case, apart from the traditional standards of accounting,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000
there should be a part of the management information provided to the interested parties,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and the company should be involved in leasing transactions.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
After a certain period of time, the size of non-returnable assets will be increased

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
by the amount of the main funds used in the leasing process.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Very often, the assessment of the assets of our companies does not reflect their fair value.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Russian companies are often undervalued.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
This is due to the lack of business reputation of Russian companies,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and the trade marks that are available to the old companies.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The assessment of the main funds is low, and does not reflect the real use of the assets.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:24.000
This is due to the fact that the balance of the main funds may be much lower than their market value.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
One example is the land or know-how patents,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
which is the amount of non-returnable assets that the company has at its disposal.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The assessment of the reserves is usually high,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
since it does not take into account the pure component of the implementation.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:52.000
This means that the super-normative limits or super-normative reserves

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
are already considered non-active or dead-end capital,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
but they also continue to be assessed in terms of the balance of the value.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Although, if such reserves have appeared, they must be evaluated and resold

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
for at least partial replenishment of the cash flow.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
This does not often happen.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
The assessment of the debitor's debt is high, and does not take into account the unreliable debts.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The expenses and the debt can be reflected not in a timely manner,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:30.000
but later, which leads to the increase of the debt.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
We do not reflect the obligations that we have,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
due to the fact that either the documents were not received,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
or in order to maintain the standards set by the shareholders

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
in relation to the debt and the debt.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
At the same time, it is a matter of belief,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
based on the report that our company prepares,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
that everything is in order with our own forces or capital,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
which is formed by a part of the property complex,

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and its share increases accordingly.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Obligations can be misclassified on the term of repayment.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
On the one hand, we assume that we have an extension of the documents,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
but on the other hand, the requirements of the creditors,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
in accordance with violations of certain agreements,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
either verbal or written, require a term of repayment earlier.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
At the same time, we take into account our obligations

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
based on the documents.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
A few words about the potential for financing enterprises.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
The scheme includes division into groups of positive and negative.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
We claim that the company has a positive financial potential,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and we expect to increase the investment attractiveness

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
compared to large public companies.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
They are old players in the market,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
with a conservative policy of attraction.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
New players always use high levels of attention from investors.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
If we go to the open financial market,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
we lack negative information.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Even if we had some contradictions with the service banks,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
this information was not included in the specialized database.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
The sources of information in the credit bureau

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
began to work actively in 2006.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Therefore, we are only an object of positive information.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
We may have a high potential for growth,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
which is also interesting for our investors.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
We have a high level of profitability,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
proven efficiency of the existing management system,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
low systemic level of activity,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and visibility of our business,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
when we clearly predict where our place in the market is,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
what is the share of our market,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and we can openly declare these indicators.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000
We can consider the procedures of working in new markets,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
which means additional business activity,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and as a result of financial components,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
this is a growth in revenue from implementation.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
We have the potential not to use segments of attraction and financing,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
primarily to reduce the cost of the attracted resources.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
At the same time, there are negative components,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
which can negatively affect the potential for financing.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
First, there is a lack of large-scale financing sources.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000
In any case, we will be felt for about two or three years in the market.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
How will we feel under the influence of time?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
How will our financial indicators deteriorate or improve?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
There are hidden and opaque forms of financing.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000
We will have to completely abandon these forms.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:38.000
In case this information suddenly appears in the market,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
we will immediately be on the list of unfavorable potential clients.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
The market can react negatively to us.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
There is a lack of disclosure of our credit history,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
how we worked with the bank.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
There is no negative information, but there is no positive information.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
There is a lack of appreciation of assets and business.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It would be possible to cost more,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
but at the same time it is impossible to prove this market

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
due to the limitation of the presence of time.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
There is a low cost of clean assets

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
due to the underestimation of the company's assets, primarily of the non-returnable block.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
There is a lack of timely management systems and accounting.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
We did not have time and investment opportunities

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
to automate the business.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
There is a possible wear and tear of production capacities.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
There may be a low level of compliance with corporate interests,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
primarily of minority shareholders.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
There is a lack of practice in disclosing information.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
These are negative factors that can have a negative impact

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
on the financing opportunities of our company.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
The next slide shows the financing scheme

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
within the framework of the current planned investment program.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
The algorithm is that if there is an investment program,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
we need the financing parameters.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
The three main parameters are the time, amount and cost.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
If we do not have an investment program,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
we can state that the absence of an investment program

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
means the absence of a formalized strategy.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
In this case, the financing objectives

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
that are at the disposal of the company

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
may have either a project characteristic

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
or be qualified through the financing parameters.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
In any case, we receive requirements

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
on the amount of funds from the financing parameters.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
We may have a positive cash flow or a negative cash flow.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
The positive cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
that can cover all the current expenses.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
The negative cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
that can be compensated for by additional financial loans

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
or by receiving funds from the sale of some assets.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
The negative cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
that can be compensated for by additional financial loans

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
or by receiving funds from the sale of some assets.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
The negative cash flow is the amount of funds

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
that can be compensated for by additional financial loans.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
At the same time, the financing parameters

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
assume that we are focusing on a long-term repayment.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
To achieve this, we need to form a market

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
that provides information from the underwriter

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
or the bondsman that the emitter or the company

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
that issued the debt is willing to repay the debt

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
in advance or from the emitter.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
This information is then provided to the underwriter

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
and the underwriter can decide

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
whether to repay the debt in advance

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
or from the emitter.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
We use the auction scheme,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
we use the bond of our debt to a particular market tool

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
or we determine the interest rate

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
depending on the market conduct.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The market conduct is based on the alternative types

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
of loans or those that exist on the fund site.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The next slide shows the main stages

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
of the bond issuance for corporate borrowers.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The first stage is the decision-making

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
on the issuance of bonds.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
To do this, we need to determine the parameters

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
and we need to understand

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
which direction we are going to use

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
the financial resources.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Or we need to determine the implementation

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
of the investment part of the company's strategy.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Then we need to clearly predict the volumes,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
the deadlines and the technology of the work

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
and the availability of new equipment

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
or the construction of new land plots

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
or the installation of new trading areas.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
The parameters of the bond are the consequence

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
of the strategy of using the borrowed capital

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
in the company's activities.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
The approval of the prospect of issuing securities

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
must be detailed,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
the deadlines,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
the repayment of debt obligations,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
the nominal value of the bond,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
the estimated interest rates.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
At the stage of decision-making

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
we need to start disclosing the information

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
and the signing of the corresponding contracts

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
with the organizer, the underwriter,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
the so-called market maker and the payment agent

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
of the bond.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
The market maker is the one who creates

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
a favorable image of the event related to the issuance

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
of securities on the debt market.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
The market maker should be able to

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
make the necessary decisions

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
and to issue the securities.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
The bond must be issued by the State.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
The third stage is the preparation

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
of the bond to be issued.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
At this stage, we should disclose the information

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
and the signing of the corresponding contracts

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000
with the organizer, the underwriter,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
the payment agent of the bond.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000
The bond must be issued by the State.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
The bond must be issued by the State.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
The bond must be issued by the State.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
The bond must be issued by the State.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
The fourth stage is the procedure

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
of issuing the bond to the trading system.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
The fourth stage is the procedure

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000
of issuing the bond to the trading system.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
The fifth stage is the preparation of the report.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
The report must be approved and registered

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
by the Federal Service for Financial Markets.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The report must be approved and registered

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
by the Federal Service for Financial Markets.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
The sixth stage is the disclosure

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
of the information in the form

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
of quarterly reports

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
on the results of the stock market activities.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
The seventh stage is the cancellation

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
of the financial activities.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
The procedure of the stock market

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
is a serious organizational transformation

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
within the company.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
The company is forced to abandon

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
some attractive, but not promising

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
methods of financial activities

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
and to abandon the conceivable

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
or hidden profitability.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
This is accompanied by the need

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
to disclose the facts of the economic activities

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and to ensure transparency

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
of the results of the quarterly reports

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
for third-party investors.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
The company is forced to disclose

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
the facts of the economic activities

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and to ensure transparency

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
of the results of the third-party investors.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
The company is forced to disclose

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
the facts of the economic activities

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
and to ensure transparency

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
of the results of the third-party investors.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
The company is forced to disclose

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
the facts of the economic activities

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
and to ensure transparency

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
of the results of the third-party investors.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000
The company is forced to disclose

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
the facts of the economic activities

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
and to ensure transparency

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
of the results of the third-party investors.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
The company is forced to disclose

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
the facts of the economic activities

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
and to ensure transparency

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
of the results of the third-party investors.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
The company is forced to disclose

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
the facts of the economic activities

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and to ensure transparency

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
of the results of the third-party investors.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
The company is forced to disclose

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
the facts of the economic activities

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and to ensure transparency

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
of the results of the third-party investors.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
We are losing the feeling of the expensiveness

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
of our business.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
We are losing the feeling of self-sufficiency

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
and the occupation of a certain place

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
in the competitive environment of the open market.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
We are losing the feeling of the expensiveness

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
and the self-sufficiency

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
of the open market.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
The open market is a source of finance

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
and is the main way and demand

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
for the development and support

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
of any business of any business organization.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
At the same time,

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
it is considered to be a loss of business benefit

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
when a company has the potential

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
to be profitable.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
At the same time,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
the key factor that affects the efficiency

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
of the operation and use of capital

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
in the company is the qualified staff,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
professionalism and experience

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
of the leading employees.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
The main factors that affect the efficiency

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
of the operation and use of capital

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
are the capital of the company

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and the capital of the employees.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
At the same time,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
the growth and development of the market

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
increases the demand for our clients

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
and the prices for our products

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
are increasing.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Companies are obliged

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
and must use the financial resources

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
for the extensive growth.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
The capital of the company

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
gives the effect of the financial lever

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
on the efficiency of the operation

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
is small and inalienable less

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
than the net profit

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
in the absolute sense.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
If a company can use

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
the favorable market opportunities,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
the property complex

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
of the company is increasing

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
due to the growth of its own capital

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
and the growth of its own capital

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
is made due to the net profit

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
of the company,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
due to the increasing share capital

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
of the company,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
and we use short-term and long-term loans

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
and loans of banks, financial organizations

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
and investment companies

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
that are ready to buy our corporate bonds,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
when they are ready to use

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
the capital of our company

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
in their economic turnover,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
the company is a first-class borrower

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
and many banks are trying to work with us.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000
It should be noted that in addition to net profit

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
as a result of the company's activities,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
it is necessary to work and give maximum management control

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
to such an aspect as the growth of the business value.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
The value of the company's business

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
is determined by the support of the company's publicity,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
openness and transparency.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
On the one hand, it is a mandatory requirement

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
of the market fund when placing bonds

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
or when issuing additional shares of our company.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
But the preparation for the opportunity

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
to work in such conditions requires

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
a long-term strategy of presence in the market.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
In this case, investors react to the facts

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
and results of the company's economic activities

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
with great confidence and pleasure

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000
and acquire the debt obligations of our company.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
In relation to the market fund,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
the company is a first-class borrower

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
and it is necessary to compare the possible ways

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
of financing that the company has at its disposal.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
We noted that companies can use

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
traditional banking lending,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
they can use the issuance or issuance of their own VXLs,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
they can use the issuance and issuance of their own shares

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
as an alternative,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000
and they can use the issuance and issuance of their own bonds.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
When making a decision

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
on the means or sources of financing

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
that we will use to implement our own strategy,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
the company must take into account

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
all the pros and cons,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
all the characteristics of the four ways

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
of implementing the company's strategy.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Depending on the working conditions,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
the size of the business,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
the direction of the use of the financial resources

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
that attract the company's capital,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
we must build an element of the financial strategy

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
as a management of capital.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
The financial director of the company

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
and his financial and economic services

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
cannot regulate or influence the business activity

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
as a way of making a profit.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
At the same time, the management of the company's expenses

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
is a function of the financial and economic services.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
If the company is undertaking

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
a management of the company's expenses

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
and the management of the company's finances

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
is a function of the financial and economic services,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
the company must be able to manage

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
the company's finances

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
and the company must be able to manage

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
the company's finances

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Many dramatics of the calculations

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
were consulted by the financial directors

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
while the financial producers Oleg Vamoshibodin

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
organized analysis.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
The financial director cannot adjust the sales profitability

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
based on the price of the product or service.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
In this case, a collegial approach is necessary

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000
when the financial director can report to the shareholders

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
the sales profitability and the assets profitability

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
based on the quantity or the normative indicator.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
This is related to the fact that the financial director

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
can report to the shareholders

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
the sales profitability and the normative indicator.
