00:00.000 --> 00:13.440
The next topic of our today's course is industrial dynamics as a scientific discipline

00:13.440 --> 00:21.160
and the consequences that the discovery of the father of this discipline,

00:21.160 --> 00:24.160
the American scientist J.F. Forrester,

00:24.160 --> 00:28.160
on the modern problems of companies,

00:28.160 --> 00:34.160
primarily in logistics and, above all, in the field of management of stocks and distribution.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.160
First of all, speaking of industrial dynamics,

00:38.160 --> 00:49.160
it should be noted that this discipline was born more than 20 years earlier than the discipline

00:49.160 --> 00:58.160
that is now recognized as the main one in the field of study and management of flow phenomena, that is, logistics.

00:58.160 --> 01:04.160
The birth time of industrial dynamics is 1961.

01:04.160 --> 01:14.160
The birth time of logistics, which became a scientific discipline, is the end of the 1970s, 1978-1979.

01:14.160 --> 01:20.160
A lot of what we now call the logistics approach to the management of a company

01:20.160 --> 01:30.160
was considered, discovered, and described by J.F. Forrester based on the dynamic modeling of a company,

01:30.160 --> 01:36.160
which is an investigation of a company as an information system with feedback.

01:37.160 --> 01:47.160
This research provides for the application of models for the design and improvement of the organization and the improvement of the general leadership.

01:47.160 --> 01:55.160
Dynamic modeling was based on the following four directions.

01:55.160 --> 01:59.160
The theory of management of information systems with feedback,

01:59.160 --> 02:13.160
automation of tactical solutions, experimental design of complex systems with the help of modeling and application of the ancestors of modern computers,

02:13.160 --> 02:21.160
the so-called digital computing machines, to reduce cost and improve the quality of computing.

02:21.160 --> 02:33.160
The book by J.F. Forrester, the foundation of cybernetics of the company, published in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961,

02:33.160 --> 02:43.160
was significantly different from many scientific works of that time, including the well-known book by Stephen Weir,

02:43.160 --> 02:47.160
which was about the development of cybernetics and production management,

02:47.160 --> 02:59.160
because it was the first attempt to synthesize the current scientific flow and provide comprehensive information on the production and management of a company.

02:59.160 --> 03:09.160
Using the cognitive capabilities of J.F. Forrester, which are the methods of formalization and modeling of the processes studied.

03:09.160 --> 03:19.160
It should be noted that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed the so-called industrial dynamics in 1956.

03:19.160 --> 03:30.160
Since 1957, there was a special group that conducted research on this problem under the guidance of J.F. Forrester.

03:30.160 --> 03:38.160
What is industrial dynamics in the terms of Professor Forrester?

03:38.160 --> 03:46.160
Industrial dynamics is a set of methods that consider the interaction between the flows of information, money, applications, materials,

03:46.160 --> 03:53.160
human resources and capital equipment in a company, industry or national economy.

03:53.160 --> 03:59.160
Industrial dynamics provides a single basis for integrating functional areas of management,

04:00.160 --> 04:08.160
such as marketing, production, accounting, financial accounting, research and project activities, as well as capital investment.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.160
It is a huge layer of management science.

04:12.160 --> 04:22.160
It should be noted that Professor Forrester was the first to see the importance of studying the flow phenomena in the management of enterprises,

04:22.160 --> 04:26.160
as soon as technical capabilities appeared.

04:26.160 --> 04:39.160
Forrester considered the formal analogies and cybernetic concepts of building an adequate dynamic model of such a complex complex system as an industrial enterprise to be insufficient.

04:39.160 --> 04:46.160
He opposed, offering them a new method of modeling enterprises as a dynamic economic system,

04:46.160 --> 04:54.160
with a conventional cybernetic view, which did not take into account the flow, the time duration of the phenomenon.

04:54.160 --> 05:03.160
He considered the changing behavior of industrial enterprises in order to develop the perfect forms of their organization and the overall leadership of their activities.

05:03.160 --> 05:13.160
In this dynamic modeling is integrated into a single structural scheme of the functional management industry, as a kind of feedback system.

05:13.160 --> 05:22.160
In his model, Forrester used six parameters, six interconnected flows that reflected the activities of an industrial enterprise.

05:22.160 --> 05:29.160
Five of them are already listed in the definition. These are the flows of materials, orders, money, equipment, labor.

05:29.160 --> 05:36.160
The sixth information flow is the connecting tissue that connects the five others.

05:36.160 --> 05:44.160
The behavior of the feedback information system is determined by its structure, as well as by the elements of the time lags,

05:44.160 --> 05:56.160
that is, the delay of the system's reaction to the irritants, and the amplifications experienced by the corresponding flows in relation to the input and output times.

05:56.160 --> 06:07.160
The dynamic structure of the model is represented by a number of reservoirs or levels connected by the flows controlled by each other.

06:07.160 --> 06:16.160
Forrester wrote, the basic structure consisting of variable levels and flows reflects the existence of the management system of industrial enterprises.

06:16.160 --> 06:25.160
It should be noted the peculiarity of the quantitative approach of J.F. Forrester to the modeling of production and economic processes.

06:25.160 --> 06:37.160
These views are closely connected with the views of the economist of the early 20th century, Kondratiev,

06:37.160 --> 06:46.160
who fought all possible scientific methods against the dictatorship of numbers.

06:46.160 --> 06:54.160
Professor Forrester is not inclined to engage in mathematical interpretations of formalization of the studied processes.

06:54.160 --> 07:00.160
His formulas have a structural advantage, not elementary in mathematical relation.

07:00.160 --> 07:07.160
The methodology of analysis of the production-economic model includes six stages.

07:07.160 --> 07:15.160
First, a specific production-economic question is determined, which is subject to analysis by the method of dynamic modeling.

07:15.160 --> 07:21.160
The result is formulated in the verbal, not mathematical, expression.

07:21.160 --> 07:27.160
The main connections or causal dependence characterize the structure of the studied system.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.160
The third stage is the construction of a mathematical model.

07:31.160 --> 07:38.160
Each part of this model is created on the basis of a graphical system, expressing the content of the previous stage.

07:38.160 --> 07:47.160
The fourth stage is the design of behavior of the modeled system or its changes in time under the influence of certain factors.

07:48.160 --> 07:56.160
The fifth stage is the imitation of the dynamics of the system on digital computers.

07:56.160 --> 08:05.160
The results are compared with the data on similar real processes, i.e. with what is now called mathematical statistics.

08:06.160 --> 08:18.160
The sixth stage is the inclusion of the revised parameters in the model of the subsequent modeling on computer technology to determine their impact on the final results.

08:18.160 --> 08:28.160
In the 1960s, the California Management Review magazine described the methodology of dynamic modeling proposed by Forrester.

08:28.160 --> 08:34.160
In this method, all the activity of the enterprise is imitated on a large digital computer.

08:34.160 --> 08:40.160
The mathematical model consists of hundreds of cascaded, sequentially solved equations.

08:40.160 --> 08:50.160
The enterprise, like a radio circuit, contains feedback, which enhances input signals and regulates the periodicity of outgoing signals.

08:51.160 --> 09:03.160
With some rather ordinary conditions, the random change in the number of orders by plus or minus 5% can cause a periodic fluctuation in the supply level by 15%,

09:03.160 --> 09:09.160
the volume of production and the number of workforce by more than 25%.

09:09.160 --> 09:20.160
In accordance with this recognition, which the Forrester model received in the practical sphere in the 1960s,

09:20.160 --> 09:27.160
the concept of Forrester effect remained in logistics and operational management.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.160
We will talk about it in more detail.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.160
Look at the following slide.

09:32.160 --> 09:42.160
The Forrester effect, otherwise called the Ball Whip effect, is formulated as follows.

09:42.160 --> 09:51.160
Minor disturbances in one part of the logistics system can be quickly increased in further distribution along the logistics channel.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.160
Look at the following slide.

09:56.160 --> 10:01.160
This is what the logistics system looks like.

10:01.160 --> 10:06.160
It consists of production, supply and output,

10:06.160 --> 10:12.160
optical links in the distribution, supply and output in the distribution channels,

10:12.160 --> 10:18.160
retail distribution links, up to the end consumer.

10:18.160 --> 10:35.160
The Forrester effect describes a situation when the result of the influence of sales is the creation of conditions for the launch of an accelerating effect and the creation of a wave in the logistics channel.

10:35.160 --> 10:40.160
This happens because moisture occurs in most logistics systems,

10:40.160 --> 10:47.160
i.e. the system's reaction to an input signal or to changes is carried out with a time delay.

10:47.160 --> 10:55.160
Thus, in the presence of a warehouse or a mediator in the logistics channel, which stores goods, a significant distortion of demand in the factory can occur.

10:55.160 --> 11:03.160
This will occur due to the accelerating effect, which can cause the arbitrary fluctuation of the operating characteristics of the system.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.160
Let's look at this example.

11:06.160 --> 11:13.160
It is quite elementary, so that we do not even have to consider it.

11:13.160 --> 11:21.160
For example, a production company sells its products to a wholesaler, and it implements them to retail traders.

11:21.160 --> 11:26.160
Let's look at the increasing effect of the distribution of indignation in the logistics channel.

11:26.160 --> 11:37.160
The policy of customer service, which is adopted by the company, requires the creation of, for example, an eight-week reserve when production is carried out.

11:37.160 --> 11:44.160
At the same time, the car has a 12-week reserve, and each of the retail traders has a three-week stock of goods.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.160
The system is made up of only three links.

11:47.160 --> 11:52.160
And what amazing results and functioning there are.

11:52.160 --> 12:00.160
As a result of the measures to stimulate the sale, the demand of end consumers is increasing by 10% per month.

12:00.160 --> 12:05.160
An elementary situation for a first-year student.

12:05.160 --> 12:17.160
However, if a retailer does not want to allow a decrease in its previous level of service, it must increase the size of the stock not by 10%, but by 11%.

12:17.160 --> 12:25.160
That is, the original 10% plus 10 multiplied by 3 divided by 52.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.160
Three weeks out of 52.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.160
In order to save the three-week stock.

12:30.160 --> 12:41.160
The retailer faces an increase in demand by 11%, which, when adjusting the level of its stock, will lead to an increase in the size of the order by 13%.

12:41.160 --> 12:46.160
11 plus 11 multiplied by 2 divided by 52.

12:46.160 --> 12:58.160
The manufacturer, striving to satisfy demand and save its eight-week stock, must increase the release of goods by 15%.

12:58.160 --> 13:07.160
That is, the initial increase in the real demand for 10% led to a growth of production by 15%.

13:07.160 --> 13:11.160
And this is just a three-link chain of distribution.

13:12.160 --> 13:23.160
You can learn more about the interaction and interaction of links with the household chain using the materials in the workbook.

13:23.160 --> 13:37.160
Please look at the overall chart, which shows the spread of the wave similar to the bend of a tail, which a trainer drives wild animals.

13:37.160 --> 13:51.160
So, dear listeners, let's consider how the effect that was discovered almost half a century ago still spoils the lives of many enterprises.

13:51.160 --> 14:04.160
It should be noted that in traditional production and logistics management systems, all enterprises are considered as isolated elements that independently plan their needs and purchases.

14:04.160 --> 14:12.160
At the same time, as we saw in the previous example, there is a significant deviation and fluctuation in the entire holistic chain.

14:12.160 --> 14:24.160
Local optimization, disagreement with the actions of the participants of this chain and, above all, insufficient information exchange lead to the so-called BALWIP effect.

14:25.160 --> 14:39.160
I repeat that this effect is a situation in which minor changes in the demand of the end consumer lead to a significant deviation in the plans of other participants of the logistics chain.

14:39.160 --> 14:45.160
Subcontractors, suppliers, outsourcers, distributors, dealers, etc.

14:46.160 --> 14:58.160
When the tail effect is identified, the continuous movement of the material and information flows in the logistics chain is disrupted, thus causing the risk of failure to fulfill the client's orders.

14:59.160 --> 15:15.160
Once, Procter & Gamble specialists, and this company can be said only one thing, that it is always the number one supplier of any network, whether it is Oshan, Walmart, Carrefour or any other.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.160
Procter & Gamble is the largest supplier.

15:18.160 --> 15:31.160
So, the specialists of this serious, large, rich company asked the question, why is the size of the orders received by the company so much higher than that of one of the most sold goods, the children's diapers.

15:31.160 --> 15:39.160
After all, their consumption by the end customer, that is, by infants, is evenly, constantly, easily predicted.

15:39.160 --> 15:51.160
After studying the statistics, first, the sales of retail stores, second, the orders received by distributors, third, the orders received by the company from distributors,

15:51.160 --> 16:05.160
and finally, the orders that Procter & Gamble places at the suppliers of raw materials, the company managers were surprised to find that the fluctuation of the orders' volumes is increasing as the supply chain moves up.

16:06.160 --> 16:12.160
It was then, and it happened in 1992, that this phenomenon was called the tail effect.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.160
Its graphic illustration is shown on the slide.

16:15.160 --> 16:24.160
The hypothesis was put forward that this effect is due to the irrationality of making a decision to replenish and form stocks.

16:24.160 --> 16:37.160
That is, when there is a sharp surge in incoming orders, the managers are inclined to reassure themselves and place such an order, so that it will satisfy the increased demand with some allowance.

16:37.160 --> 16:42.160
So as not to write documents again, not to request, not to wait.

16:42.160 --> 16:54.160
When such an increased order arrives, naturally, after a while, the surge of interest in the product, as a rule, already gives way to a decline, and the stock is overstocked.

16:54.160 --> 17:03.160
Therefore, the next order will be either delayed until the remaining stock is spent, or significantly reduced in volume.

17:04.160 --> 17:15.160
The supplier of the product, receiving such uneven orders, builds forecasts with an even greater spread of values, and tasks its supplier of components with even greater jumps.

17:15.160 --> 17:28.160
That is, the normal logarithmic distribution described by the Gauss curve is gaining more and more flat shapes.

17:29.160 --> 17:39.160
However, a close look at the problem showed that the problem is not only in the behavioral characteristics of those people who are responsible for determining the needs.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.160
The tail effect has a number of objective reasons.

17:43.160 --> 17:50.160
Among them, errors in forecasting demand can be highlighted.

17:50.160 --> 17:58.160
Dear colleagues, trust in forecasts is already being tested.

17:58.160 --> 18:05.160
The fact is that the strategic forecast is already a 2-year forecast.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.160
What will be next is hard to predict.

18:09.160 --> 18:17.160
Any forecast has a very unpleasant feature, with the rise of the forecasting horizon, and the accuracy is falling.

18:17.160 --> 18:22.160
With the rise of the forecast detail, the accuracy is falling.

18:22.160 --> 18:30.160
To deal with uncertainty in forecasting, enterprises create additional insurance reserves.

18:30.160 --> 18:35.160
The stock is always the basis of risk management in logistics.

18:35.160 --> 18:41.160
This leads to an arbitrary increase in the size of the batches of deliveries.

18:41.160 --> 18:52.160
This is facilitated by the aspiration of logistics units to transport the supplied raw materials in large batches to achieve the scale effect.

18:52.160 --> 18:58.160
The next reason is instability of the global market prices.

18:59.160 --> 19:10.160
An important reason is a delay in obtaining the necessary information about the needs, and, in the end, a deviation from the planned delivery times and volumes.

19:10.160 --> 19:16.160
Each company forms a plan of its orders based on forecasting the demand of its customers.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.160
We have already discussed this.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.160
As a rule, the forecast is based on data from the previous period.

19:22.160 --> 19:36.160
The statistical methods of processing data extrapolate the data of rising and falling trends a little further, beyond the real limit of the rise and fall of demand.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.160
But extrapolation is extrapolation.

19:38.160 --> 19:47.160
Taking into account this error in both the direction of increase and decrease, the company forms its orders to the supplier.

19:47.160 --> 19:55.160
At the same time, it also comes from the level of its current reserves, subtracting or adding the volume of orders that were exceeded or not received in the previous order.

19:55.160 --> 20:03.160
Accordingly, the supplier, analyzing the time series of orders, forecasts its needs with even greater demand.

20:03.160 --> 20:08.160
You will find evidence of this in the following slide.

20:09.160 --> 20:19.160
In practice, it is very difficult to find a company that would unambiguously transform incoming orders into outgoing orders without processing and generalization.

20:19.160 --> 20:30.160
Of course, we are talking about Just-in-Time systems and their birth, because their application requires very specific working conditions.

20:30.160 --> 20:37.160
The demand of the company's customers is formed by a set of incoming data for the reserve management system,

20:37.160 --> 20:45.160
which at the output gives a solution for when and how many goods need to be purchased and what assortment positions.

20:45.160 --> 20:53.160
As a rule, customer orders are consolidated up to the minimum order size that can correspond to either the optimal reserve size,

20:53.160 --> 21:06.160
in accordance with the famous Wilson formula, or the load normalization of the vehicle, the so-called full transit load.

21:06.160 --> 21:16.160
The larger the order size and the less orders are made, the greater the degree of deviation.

21:17.160 --> 21:23.160
On the other hand, the company can observe large jumps in the demand of its customers,

21:23.160 --> 21:29.160
which will later lead to a high degree of uncertainty of demand.

21:29.160 --> 21:41.160
Based on the X, Y, Z analysis, the observed phenomena will be in the category of Y,

21:41.160 --> 21:49.160
and the price of information transparency is such.

21:49.160 --> 21:54.160
In fact, the company analyzes not the total demand of its customers, but the flow of orders,

21:54.160 --> 22:00.160
each of which is formed based on individual reserve replenishment systems.

22:00.160 --> 22:09.160
In this case, the transformed demand has a pronounced inequality, which is shown in the following slide.

22:09.160 --> 22:18.160
In the following slide, you can see all three reasons for the tail effect.

22:18.160 --> 22:23.160
This is an increasing error in forecasting, consolidation of orders, and price policy.

22:23.160 --> 22:27.160
We will talk about price policy now.

22:27.160 --> 22:38.160
Excessive fluctuations in demand can be provoked by this phenomenon, which is primarily responsible for by the marketing service.

22:38.160 --> 22:45.160
The period of price reduction by special promotions, both above the level and below the level,

22:45.160 --> 22:53.160
usually attracts many customers who, in an attempt to benefit from the so-called fallen chance,

22:53.160 --> 22:56.160
form speculative reserves.

22:56.160 --> 23:01.160
Naturally, after the end of the promotion, the decline in orders follows,

23:01.160 --> 23:08.160
and customers begin to spend their reserves, possibly waiting for the next period of discounts.

23:08.160 --> 23:12.160
The situation is also mentioned in the West Press, when in the conditions of a deficit,

23:12.160 --> 23:19.160
customers submit deliberately overstated applications in response to their partial implementation policy.

23:19.160 --> 23:25.160
And when the level of supply finally catches up with demand, the order cancellation follows.

23:26.160 --> 23:35.160
The same picture was typical for the Soviet supply system, especially at the last, stagnating stage of its development.

23:35.160 --> 23:41.160
In modern market conditions, a repeat of this model is unlikely to be possible.

23:41.160 --> 23:49.160
The Forester effect, the tail effect, has a negative effect on the efficiency of the operation of all supply chain participants.

23:49.160 --> 23:57.160
First of all, because it provokes an accumulation of excessive safety reserves for each chain participant.

23:57.160 --> 24:05.160
Therefore, the development of measures to smooth this effect is one of the most relevant logistic tasks.

24:05.160 --> 24:09.160
First of all, logistics of purchases and logistics of reserves.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.160
There are several approaches to its solution.

24:12.160 --> 24:17.160
One of them is the use of advanced technologies.

24:17.160 --> 24:22.160
The basis of this approach is a complex information interaction between the supply chain participants,

24:22.160 --> 24:27.160
which allows for automated analysis of the final demand.

24:27.160 --> 24:35.160
For example, if a manufacturer has access to data on the sales of its products directly from the trade halls,

24:35.160 --> 24:43.160
it will be easy to predict the volume it should unload to the distribution center supplying this retail chain.

24:43.160 --> 24:46.160
This technology is implemented by Walmart.

24:46.160 --> 24:56.160
Walmart, based on the information that comes from the so-called point of sales,

24:56.160 --> 25:03.160
which is just a cash register with the cash register owner at the exit from the store's trade hall,

25:03.160 --> 25:11.160
sends 100 of its largest suppliers every day, and the first is Procter & Gamble.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.160
Information on the real demand for their products.

25:14.160 --> 25:19.160
This is how information should be used to build a supply chain.

25:19.160 --> 25:27.160
Modern information technology and the ERP class allow for this method.

25:27.160 --> 25:33.160
In Russia, the construction of a managed supply chain has its own peculiarities.

25:33.160 --> 25:39.160
Supply chains are built and managed mainly within the framework of holdings.

25:39.160 --> 25:45.160
When individual elements of the chain are connected by the right to property,

25:45.160 --> 25:48.160
and the possibility of direct control.

25:48.160 --> 25:54.160
This is connected with a very serious information closeness of the business,

25:54.160 --> 26:01.160
low discipline of contractual relations, and a number of negative reasons,

26:01.160 --> 26:05.160
which are typical of Russian business at the current stage.

26:05.160 --> 26:09.160
Another option, compared to the ones listed in the table,

26:09.160 --> 26:23.160
is the possibility of information integration based on the work with the providers of logistic services of the 4PL class.

26:23.160 --> 26:34.160
This is the so-called work on technology VMI, Vendors Managed Inventory, or CMI, Co-Managed Inventory.

26:34.160 --> 26:39.160
The seller manages the stock of his client on his own.

26:39.160 --> 26:45.160
The advantage of this approach is obvious, as it eliminates the very basis of the tail effect.

26:45.160 --> 26:51.160
However, the implementation of such technology requires not only serious financial investments,

26:51.160 --> 26:55.160
but also a high degree of information integration.

26:55.160 --> 27:02.160
This is possible only with the maturity of the company and the maturity of the business environment as a whole.

27:02.160 --> 27:08.160
Unfortunately, there are only a few such companies in Russia.

27:08.160 --> 27:16.160
I think, only a few, even if you count them by the fingers, even with two hands.

27:16.160 --> 27:27.160
However, there is an opportunity to use the administrative resource of a company that is the key in the supply chain.

27:28.160 --> 27:33.160
Each supply chain has a leader, or a so-called focus company,

27:33.160 --> 27:38.160
which determines the policy of the entire chain as a link with the greatest weight.

27:38.160 --> 27:42.160
In the chain, the manufacturer, distributor, retail trader,

27:42.160 --> 27:47.160
with such a link, most often, since recently, becomes the manufacturer,

27:47.160 --> 27:53.160
who is able to strictly prescribe to the distributor when and how many goods he should buy.

27:53.160 --> 27:59.160
The obligation to choose a certain quota along with a restriction on the purity of orders

27:59.160 --> 28:07.160
and the possibility of correcting the purchase plan leads to the organization of a convenient, predictable for the manufacturer.

28:07.160 --> 28:14.160
All risks and numerous uncertainties in this case are simply transferred to the lower links.

28:14.160 --> 28:19.160
The future of such an approach is doubtful precisely because of this.

28:19.160 --> 28:26.160
At least because the dictator company usually has a mediocre and very vague idea

28:26.160 --> 28:31.160
of the real demand for its products and is unlikely to fully realize its market potential.

28:31.160 --> 28:40.160
In addition, recently, there has been a tendency to shift the influence in the supply chain towards network retailers.

28:40.160 --> 28:44.160
So what to do with a company that does not have a solid information platform,

28:44.160 --> 28:50.160
unprogressed relations with partners, and the inability to dictate its conditions to the agent?

28:50.160 --> 28:56.160
The advice is as always, one, as always, it works in any business sphere.

28:56.160 --> 29:01.160
This is to show vigilance, ingenuity, and patience.

29:01.160 --> 29:05.160
First, you need to understand the real nature of the demand fluctuations.

29:05.160 --> 29:10.160
For example, the X, Y, Z analysis already mentioned will allow the customers

29:11.160 --> 29:14.160
to identify a group of customers with a stable level of consumption.

29:14.160 --> 29:18.160
If the volumes of orders jump from such customers to the majority,

29:18.160 --> 29:24.160
there is a low-coordinated flow of orders that creates an illusion of unequality of demand.

29:24.160 --> 29:30.160
As soon as the causes of the distortion of the real demand are found, action can be taken.

29:30.160 --> 29:35.160
Possible options are indicated in the slides.

29:35.160 --> 29:43.160
This list is open for replenishment, because the establishment of effective interaction with customers and suppliers is not exhausted.

29:43.160 --> 29:51.160
No matter how it is promoted by formal science, it is partly in the field of art. Art is negotiated.

30:06.160 --> 30:20.160
Dear colleagues, we will now continue our course on the theory of limitations of Israeli physicist Eliyahu Goldratt.

30:20.160 --> 30:28.160
But first I would like to quote two statements of great people, each in their own way.

30:29.160 --> 30:37.160
The first was called Albert Einstein, who said that no problem can be solved at the same level of thought development as we have created it.

30:37.160 --> 30:46.160
The conclusion is that every new phenomenon, whether favorable or unfavorable,

30:46.160 --> 30:56.160
will require new efforts, discoveries, and research, which will help our knowledge to rise to a new level.

30:56.160 --> 31:01.160
The second statement, which I called the postulate of Reinhold Messner,

31:01.160 --> 31:16.160
Reinhold Messner is the first Italian climber to conquer all the 8000-meter mountains on Earth alone, using minimal equipment.

31:17.160 --> 31:26.160
Therefore, he probably knew what to say when he said that the pace of ascent is set by the slowest member of the group.

31:26.160 --> 31:32.160
The technology and tools of enterprise management are developing at an amazing pace today.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.160
But another thing is even more amazing.

31:34.160 --> 31:45.160
The basis of management thinking still has the views, beliefs, and stereotypes that have not changed significantly in the last few decades.

31:45.160 --> 31:53.160
The solution of the entire complex of problems of a modern enterprise is impossible with only technical means.

31:53.160 --> 32:02.160
The improvement of the level of IT technology, the improvement of management, means, first of all, to raise management thinking to a new level.

32:03.160 --> 32:16.160
The basis of the theory of limitations is the desire to translate the answers from the plane of what and how to the plane of what, how, and why.

32:16.160 --> 32:25.160
The theory of limitations strives to raise management thinking to a new level, returning to simple and clear objective laws.

32:26.160 --> 32:46.160
Dear colleagues, if your company has constant breaks in the order execution, a long production cycle, low profitability of the invested capital, excessive reserves, irregular and over-the-counter work in production that has become regular,

32:47.160 --> 33:01.160
your production plan is often crossed. You are chronically short of one or the other resources, you are not ready to take more and more orders, and this leads to tensions and conflicts in the team.

33:01.160 --> 33:10.160
If you have tried different approaches, but the economic result does not suit you, you have a serious problem.

33:10.160 --> 33:19.160
The possible solution that I will tell you about after the next list of possible troubles and troubles.

33:19.160 --> 33:38.160
If your company has many overdue and incomplete deliveries, frequent shortages of some goods in excess of others, irregular and out-of-plan orders for production, high return levels or writing off of finished products, low turnover of reserves,

33:38.160 --> 33:57.160
and you have tried different approaches, but the economic result does not suit you, if you have a chronic overuse of funds for projects, excessive long periods of their implementation, chaotic movement of resources and priorities between projects or works,

33:57.160 --> 34:17.160
regular night shifts that separate you and your employees from your loved ones, and a lack of readiness to take new projects, if you have tried different approaches, but the economic result does not suit you, try to apply the limitation theory

34:17.160 --> 34:31.160
The main postulate of the limitation theory is that all types of activities in the logistics chain can be defined as narrow-space and non-narrow-space.

34:31.160 --> 34:50.160
The production time of the entire system is determined by the types of activities that create narrow spaces.

34:50.160 --> 35:07.160
This leads to the creation of unnecessary reserves in narrow places. The limitation theory is not an economic direction, but a universal philosophy developed by Ilya Kovdrat, management of complex systems

35:07.160 --> 35:21.160
That is widely known and successfully applied by many companies for almost 20 years. Ilya Kovdrat is a scientist and consultant, a writer and entrepreneur in one person.

35:21.160 --> 35:40.160
But above all, he is a thinker, who makes others think. Kovdrat persuasively and convincingly calls on his audience, which I also treated, which I hope you will treat, to look at the usual activity of others

35:40.160 --> 35:54.160
The limitation theory goes back to the mid-1970s, to the computer program developed by Kovdrat, Optimized Production Timetables.

35:54.160 --> 36:08.160
Back then, this scientist stated that manufacturers do not develop production timetables efficiently and do not manage resources and material stocks of their enterprises successfully.

36:08.160 --> 36:29.640
To solve this problem, he and his associates from Creative Output developed software that allows operation timetables, taking production capacity into account, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, instruments, materials, and other limitations.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.840
which affect the company's ability to operate without lag.

36:33.840 --> 36:40.600
The timetables in OOPT are executed precisely.

36:40.600 --> 36:50.640
They can be run on a computer in parts, that is, in the same time periods as the MRP system that is already mentioned in our courses.

36:51.640 --> 37:00.640
All this became possible because the timetable was based on the operation limits in narrow production chains,

37:00.640 --> 37:06.840
in other words, on insufficient resources and on excess resources of production flow.

37:06.840 --> 37:16.840
To simplify understanding of timetables, Dr. Goldratt provides 9 main production planning rules.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.840
Let's consider them.

37:18.840 --> 37:27.840
When planning your enterprise, do not try to balance power, but try to balance flow.

37:27.840 --> 37:36.840
The degree of use of excess resources is determined not by their potential, but by other limitations in the system.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.840
The use and activation of resources are not the same.

37:41.840 --> 37:48.840
An hour lost in a narrow place, that is, on insufficient resources, is an hour lost in the whole system.

37:48.840 --> 37:57.840
While an hour saved on excess resources is nothing more than a mirage that gives nothing to your enterprise as a whole.

37:57.840 --> 38:02.840
Perhaps only an increase in salary or a bonus to a separate employee.

38:02.840 --> 38:09.840
The performance and level of the material stock of the system is determined by insufficient resources.

38:09.840 --> 38:17.840
The transfer rate should not necessarily be equal to the processing rate, and in some cases this is simply unacceptable.

38:17.840 --> 38:30.840
The size of the processing rate should not change throughout the technological route, neither in the time scale nor in the distance scale.

38:30.840 --> 38:37.840
Priorities should be determined and set only on the basis of the results of the system's research and limitations.

38:37.840 --> 38:44.840
The production time is determined by a specific schedule based on the study of the limitations.

38:44.840 --> 38:51.840
There are many disputes around this program, and they continue to this day.

38:51.840 --> 39:01.840
It was not only one of the first programs of the so-called final planning of production, which dominated the entire field of production activities.

39:02.840 --> 39:10.840
Its uniqueness was that it embodied new concepts that clearly contradicted some traditional rules of management.

39:10.840 --> 39:17.840
In practice, it turned out that these new concepts became even more effective than the OOPT program itself.

39:17.840 --> 39:24.840
And at that time, OOPT ceased to be just a computer program and turned into a new approach to management.

39:24.840 --> 39:33.840
It was by expanding the boundaries of this approach that Dr. Goldratt developed the theory of constraints,

39:33.840 --> 39:40.840
which gained great popularity as a method of solving problems in many areas of business.

39:40.840 --> 39:53.840
One of the co-authors of Dr. Goldratt, the Israeli economist Emi Schragenheim, said that the theory of constraints is a unique philosophy of management

39:53.840 --> 40:06.840
based on common sense and scientific approach. It allows to simplify the perception of complex social systems and maintain the controllability of all their main aspects.

40:06.840 --> 40:16.840
In the famous edition called Epics Dictionary by James Cox, the co-author of several of Goldratt's works,

40:16.840 --> 40:23.840
it is said that the philosophy of management developed by Goldratt, which can be divided into three separate but interconnected areas,

40:23.840 --> 40:32.840
logistics, system of indicators, and logical thinking, helps 90% of companies that applied.

40:32.840 --> 40:42.840
The theory of constraints is a multifaceted philosophy of management, a systematic rethinking of many fundamental beliefs

40:42.840 --> 40:50.840
that show that they are nothing more than preconceptions. This theory is a new approach to solving complex problems.

40:50.840 --> 40:58.840
The theory of constraints is known under other names, such as CM, Constraint Management,

40:58.840 --> 41:12.840
as well as synchronous flow manufacturing, SFM, synchronous production, or OOPT.

41:12.840 --> 41:21.840
These names are often used as synonyms of the theory of constraints, but earlier stages of its development will be more accurate,

41:21.840 --> 41:27.840
unlike later ones characterized by the application of thinking processes.

41:27.840 --> 41:38.840
Unlike many economists, Goldratt did not limit himself to technical tools, but developed a unique set of thinking processes

41:38.840 --> 41:52.840
Logistic, logical, semantic, systematic thinking methods that allow for a unique solution and continuous improvement of the organization

41:52.840 --> 42:05.840
If not to avoid such a painful procedure as reengineering of business processes, then to minimize the negative effects of this process

42:05.840 --> 42:15.840
The essence of thinking processes is the systematic application of logical analysis to social systems, which is the organization.

42:15.840 --> 42:22.840
Using them allows to simplify the description of complex systems, the interconnection between their elements,

42:22.840 --> 42:26.840
while improving the general perception and understanding of systems as a whole.

42:26.840 --> 42:38.840
The main steps that must be applied when using Goldratt's theory of constraints can be seen in the following slide.

42:38.840 --> 42:43.840
The book on the theory of constraints is considered a textbook.

42:43.840 --> 42:50.840
The book by Ilya Goldratt is called The Goal, which is a production novel.

42:50.840 --> 43:06.840
It has been published in millions, translated into several dozen languages, and has received the award from the World Trade Chamber as the best book on management in the last 15 years.

43:06.840 --> 43:13.840
This is the first book on business written in the form of a novel.

43:13.840 --> 43:25.840
The main character of this story is a factory manager of a fictional company, Unico, Alex Rogo is in a rather difficult position.

43:25.840 --> 43:32.840
For three months he has to not only increase the productivity of the company, which is always late with orders,

43:32.840 --> 43:38.840
and therefore loses customers, but also save the factory from closure and its workplace.

43:38.840 --> 43:47.840
Alex is struggling with the excess of supplies, late orders, and the asynchronous operation of the production facilities of his factory.

43:47.840 --> 43:52.840
He is being helped and instructed by a guru, a physicist of the UN.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.840
Goldratt himself is easily guessed in this character.

43:56.840 --> 44:02.840
He is a professor of physics, and has several dozen Israeli and American international patents.

44:02.840 --> 44:07.840
The results of the book achieved by the main characters are not fictional.

44:07.840 --> 44:13.840
This is what real companies have achieved, which use the theory of limitations.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.840
Goldratt's books are not only published, they are spent on millions of copies.

44:18.840 --> 44:25.840
For example, in Japan, the target for a total copy was four times higher than Harry Potter's.

44:25.840 --> 44:31.840
The theory of limitations is being studied today in more than 200 business schools around the world.

44:31.840 --> 44:35.840
Goldratt himself has long since become his own limitation.

44:35.840 --> 44:41.840
His schedule of master classes and consulting projects requires the achievement of the limits of human abilities.

44:41.840 --> 44:49.840
Those who stand up to the struggle with the limitations, Goldratt not only promises, but also fixes contracts for consulting services,

44:49.840 --> 44:55.840
that in less than four years their annual profit is equal to the current annual turnover.

44:55.840 --> 45:04.840
At the same time, despite the aviator's interest in the theory, Goldratt admits that only 5% of production companies in the world actually apply it.

45:04.840 --> 45:09.840
It's like the Bible. Many believe, but few practice it in their everyday life.

45:09.840 --> 45:16.840
The technology of thought processes allows to deal with problems.

45:16.840 --> 45:21.840
It is described by Goldratt in his book, The Goal 2. The case is not in luck.

45:21.840 --> 45:29.840
In the second series of the production novel, Alex Rogov already heads three companies that are included in the conglomerate.

45:29.840 --> 45:35.840
His tasks have become more complex. He has three months to make them profitable.

45:35.840 --> 45:48.840
To answer his difficult questions, such as customer needs, investment potential, strategy of holding,

45:48.840 --> 45:59.840
he uses the thought processes, a set of well-known tools that allow to simplify and organize the description of complex systems.

45:59.840 --> 46:09.840
Goldratt didn't invent the principles of thinking. He just used well-known tools of logic to solve new problems.

46:09.840 --> 46:16.840
Having mastered the thought processes, the organization can answer three key questions of management.

46:16.840 --> 46:22.840
What to change, what to change, and how to make changes.

46:22.840 --> 46:33.840
The main difference between the theory of limitation and other management concepts is the ability to identify the point of application of efforts.

46:33.840 --> 46:42.840
Having identified the direction of impact, the organization is constantly improving its activities, significantly saving investments.

46:42.840 --> 46:47.840
Goldratt calls his theory the concept of natural simplicity of the system.

46:47.840 --> 46:55.840
He says that companies, like social systems, are not so different from natural physical systems.

46:55.840 --> 47:00.840
And the principles of the world are more universal than they are considered.

47:00.840 --> 47:08.840
We'll talk about the system approach. You'll find the basis of the theory of limitation in the applicable workbook.

47:08.840 --> 47:18.840
What I like as a specialist who studied the theory of limitation seriously is that it is simple.

47:18.840 --> 47:24.840
The simplicity of dividing the limitation. Limitation in volumes and limitation in politics. Everything is logical.

47:24.840 --> 47:31.840
The actions of the manager are described in the case of volume limitations. And the system approach is visible.

47:31.840 --> 47:35.840
What I like about this theory is the simplicity and logic.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.840
What is the system approach to management?

47:38.840 --> 47:42.840
There are two global approaches to the creation and management of an organization.

47:42.840 --> 47:45.840
I'll call them the master approach and the system approach.

47:45.840 --> 47:54.840
The master approach is that to achieve the tasks in front of the organization, it relies on experts.

47:54.840 --> 47:59.840
We'll call them masters. In such organizations, the following phenomenon can be found.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.840
The managers are the actors.

48:01.840 --> 48:09.840
Everything that happens in the organization happens only thanks to the managers, who often wear several hats at the same time.

48:09.840 --> 48:14.840
The line between those who produce and those who manage is blurred by processes.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.840
The managers personally control the process of work.

48:18.840 --> 48:25.840
The managing director or the president of the company basically plays the role of either the dispatcher or the chief expeditor, in the best case.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.840
Pushing through the late orders.

48:28.840 --> 48:33.840
Almost no order goes on time if it is not under the personal control of the management.

48:33.840 --> 48:41.840
For the organization of daily activities to meet the needs of customers, the company relies on several key figures.

48:41.840 --> 48:44.840
The key figures are the managers.

48:44.840 --> 48:50.840
The training period of the position is very long and similar to the student's.

48:50.840 --> 48:59.840
Since the system is absent, before the manager fully masters his position, he must be on it for a long time

48:59.840 --> 49:04.840
To go through most of the situations and learn to react to them correctly.

49:05.840 --> 49:11.840
A simple example of an organization built on this approach is a small family restaurant in the neighborhood.

49:11.840 --> 49:20.840
As soon as the owners are absent for a while, we notice that the kitchen has become worse, the service is not so friendly, and not so clean.

49:20.840 --> 49:24.840
We make sure that the master is not there.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.840
What does the approach to the master lead to?

49:27.840 --> 49:33.840
The managers spend more time working inside the process, not above it.

49:33.840 --> 49:41.840
As a result, when the managers and experts leave the organization, it is not able to function at the same level as before.

49:41.840 --> 49:45.840
The system approach does not rely on experts.

49:45.840 --> 49:53.840
The managers make an effort to create a reliable process of organization management, a process that can be taught to others.

49:53.840 --> 50:01.840
The managers develop the business model as if they were going to distribute it through the franchising mechanism.

50:01.840 --> 50:11.840
When the recipient acquires the franchise from the franchiser, not only by acquiring the name, but also by the policy with specific processes for successful business.

50:11.840 --> 50:16.840
In organizations based on the family approach, you will find the following.

50:16.840 --> 50:21.840
Daily activity to satisfy the needs of the client is conducted by the system itself.

50:21.840 --> 50:26.840
The business is practically on autopilot, without direct intervention from the management.

50:26.840 --> 50:30.840
The managers' efforts are focused almost exclusively on planning the future.

50:30.840 --> 50:34.840
The goal of the training is to train the system.

50:34.840 --> 50:38.840
The example of a business based on a system approach is McDonald's.

50:38.840 --> 50:49.840
Regardless of what you think about the food offered at McDonald's, you can always buy the promised quality of the product at an acceptable price and quickly.

50:49.840 --> 50:53.840
It is no secret that McDonald's is one of the most successful firms in the history of business.

50:53.840 --> 50:58.840
It has achieved the goal of a system approach, consistency and reliability.

50:58.840 --> 51:03.840
It is rare that an organization follows only one or another approach.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.840
As a rule, this is something in between.

51:05.840 --> 51:15.840
And yet, in many new and fast-growing firms, in many fast-growing countries, the elements of the approach of a master prevail in business management.

51:15.840 --> 51:21.840
The owners of the firm and directors of young enterprises are usually deeply involved in the implementation of the processes.

51:21.840 --> 51:26.840
They are constantly busy with what makes the wheels spin.

51:26.840 --> 51:31.840
And the bigger the firm, the more difficult it is to keep all processes under control.

51:31.840 --> 51:41.840
How often do we hear the slander that competent managers are not enough, that there is no one to delegate responsibility, that everyone must be checked personally.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.840
And it takes too much time.

51:43.840 --> 51:52.840
And we also often hear that effective management depends on competent management, more than any other factor.

51:52.840 --> 51:57.840
Some go even further and call management skills art.

51:57.840 --> 52:09.840
At the same time, we all clearly realize that the approach of a master is a serious obstacle for the growth of existing firms and for the circulation of entrepreneurial success in new companies.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.840
Why is it difficult to manage business organizations as systems?

52:14.840 --> 52:17.840
Let's repeat what a system is.

52:17.840 --> 52:25.840
We will assume that a system is a certain number of interconnected elements that jointly participate in a certain process.

52:25.840 --> 52:34.840
In the process of operation, the system takes a certain input and processes it, and produces a certain output.

52:35.840 --> 52:40.840
In the process of input-output transfer, the system creates an added value.

52:40.840 --> 52:50.840
We can conclude that the so-called system passage, the term of the city is a measure of the value of the system.

52:50.840 --> 52:54.840
Why is it difficult to manage business organizations as systems?

52:54.840 --> 53:00.840
Because there are two factors connected to each other, two global, universal problems.

53:01.840 --> 53:04.840
The first problem is complexity and uncertainty.

53:04.840 --> 53:09.840
An organization consisting of more than seven people is already a complex system.

53:09.840 --> 53:18.840
Complex in the sense that it is difficult to predict what consequences will have on various units of the organization.

53:18.840 --> 53:26.840
Due to the huge number of interactions between people and departments, it is difficult to establish causal-consequential connections.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.840
The second problem is uncertainty.

53:28.840 --> 53:35.840
The existence of uncertainty within the organization means that any decision or action can lead to various results.

53:35.840 --> 53:43.840
The interaction of these two factors makes many managers believe that managing a business is more of an art than a science.

53:43.840 --> 53:47.840
How do we approach managing complex systems?

53:47.840 --> 53:49.840
We break them down into subsystems.

53:49.840 --> 53:54.840
Each of the subsystems is less complex than the system as a whole.

53:54.840 --> 54:02.840
If we have doubts about whether this is our approach to management, look at the scheme of your organizational structure.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.840
The fragmentation of the system into subsystems has its own price.

54:05.840 --> 54:11.840
It leads to desynchronization, to the practice of local optimums, to the local mentality.

54:11.840 --> 54:18.840
Since our systems are incredibly complex, it seems that all we can do is to minimize this price.

54:18.840 --> 54:22.840
To do everything possible to improve synchronization.

54:22.840 --> 54:30.840
As long as we believe that the only way to improve the management model is to achieve a sharp growth in revenue in a relatively short period of time,

54:30.840 --> 54:36.840
it will seem to us that it is impossible to bring the company to increase in revenue in less than four years.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.840
I will sell it to you today.

54:38.840 --> 54:45.840
In order to see the true potential of the company, it is necessary to look at the concept of complexity of systems in more depth.

54:45.840 --> 54:53.840
It is often difficult to manage our systems because the impact on one of the components causes consequences in others.

54:53.840 --> 54:57.840
The causes of the consequences, in fact, turn the system into a labyrinth.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.840
But this gives the key to the solution.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.840
Let's imagine it this way.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.840
Let's take a particular problem and ask a question.

55:04.840 --> 55:09.840
What is the minimum number of points to touch to influence the whole system?

55:09.840 --> 55:15.840
If the answer is 10, it is difficult to manage such a system, it has too many degrees of freedom.

55:15.840 --> 55:21.840
If the answer is 1, this system has one degree of freedom and it is easy to manage.

55:21.840 --> 55:31.840
Do you agree that the more dependencies there are between different components, the less degrees of freedom this system has?

55:31.840 --> 55:39.840
The fact that your system is extremely complex means that it is managed by a small number of elements.

55:39.840 --> 55:47.840
In order to maximize this natural simplicity, we need to find those elements that manage the whole system.

55:47.840 --> 55:54.840
Such elements that determine the results of the system's activities are its limitations.

55:54.840 --> 56:04.840
As I said, the managers are not able to handle the complexity of the whole system, so they divide it into sub-systems.

56:04.840 --> 56:13.840
Organizations are divided into divisions, departments, and parts of the organization are managed as separate small systems.

56:13.840 --> 56:16.840
This is the most widespread way of management.

56:17.840 --> 56:25.840
An experienced manager knows this well. This method of managing the complexity of an organization has serious negative consequences.

56:25.840 --> 56:37.840
When each sub-system is managed as an independent system, there is a tendency to set goals and set rules based on local interests.

56:37.840 --> 56:45.840
Everyone knows that saving money in one department can lead to huge losses in another.

56:45.840 --> 56:50.840
Since sub-systems are in interaction, their local tasks and rules are conflicted.

56:50.840 --> 56:58.840
What looks good for one department may seem negative for others.

56:58.840 --> 57:04.840
Everyone is familiar with the conflict situation between logistics and marketing.

57:05.840 --> 57:15.840
Synchronizing logistics and marketing work against the background of an emotional context of conflict becomes problematic.

57:15.840 --> 57:23.840
In this case, synchronization cannot be talked about. We are talking about sub-optimization.

57:23.840 --> 57:31.840
In many cases, sub-optimization is a problem with managing a business organization.

57:31.840 --> 57:42.840
Any local solution, possibly the best one, can intensify the impact of external uncertainty and harm the whole system.

57:42.840 --> 57:46.840
We have come across a real paradox.

57:46.840 --> 57:54.840
In order to reduce the complexity and control variability, an organization is divided into small manageable parts.

57:54.840 --> 57:59.840
Local management, however, increases the complexity and creates uncertainty.

57:59.840 --> 58:04.840
Local management is worse than the disease itself.

58:04.840 --> 58:11.840
If we consider a business organization as a system, we must admit that it is oriented towards achieving a certain goal.

58:11.840 --> 58:15.840
What is the company's goal? Obviously, to make money.

58:15.840 --> 58:18.840
That is why the company is created and invested.

58:18.840 --> 58:25.840
If we take into account that companies do not work on their own, that there is competition,

58:25.840 --> 58:30.840
and that companies stagnating at one level will soon be displaced,

58:30.840 --> 58:34.840
we must admit that the company's goal is a more complex task.

58:34.840 --> 58:36.840
Making money now and in the future.

58:36.840 --> 58:42.840
That is why managers strive to improve the financial performance of the organization.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.840
The combination of three conditions.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.840
The fact that the company is divided into smaller parts.

58:47.840 --> 58:53.840
The fact that people are influenced by what is under their control.

58:53.840 --> 59:01.840
The fact that for most departments local costs are the only thing under direct control of the managers.

59:01.840 --> 59:13.840
The fact that the focus of the attention of the majority of managers is focused on local costs.

59:13.840 --> 59:23.840
When we say that the company's main task is to make money, it is not quite so.

59:23.840 --> 59:28.840
The most important thing is the so-called throughput.

59:28.840 --> 59:36.840
This is the money that the system creates by transferring the input to the output and selling it to the client.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.840
Why does throughput matter?

59:39.840 --> 59:48.840
In the context of the system approach to management, there are two reasons to consider increasing the throughput as the number one priority.

59:48.840 --> 59:57.840
Unlike reducing costs to the limit of zero, increasing this number as a way to improve the financial results has no theoretical limit.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:06.840
The second reason is that increasing the throughput implies a completely opposite logic to achieving the system's improvement.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.840
Let's consider an analogy with the goal.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:15.840
The throughput is only at the very end of the chain as a result of the efforts made by all links.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.840
If one of the links in the supply chain drops a ball, the entire chain is at risk.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Moving the focus of costs to the throughput is the same as moving the focus of the chain's weight to its strength.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.840
What determines the strength of the chain?

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.840
Of course, its weakest link.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:41.840
If you, for example, improve any other link, even if you increase its strength by several times, will this increase the overall strength of the chain?

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840
No, of course not.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:54.840
As soon as you make a certain throughput, you immediately realize that most of the improvements in most links do not contribute to the improvement of the chain.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.840
The global optimum is not the sum of local optimums.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:05.840
Thus, we are forever forgiving the system for how business was done for almost the entire 20th century.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:14.840
The key idea of the limitation theory is that each system oriented to achieving the goal has a very small number of limitations.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:22.840
Based on this position, it is obvious that the management of the system should be focused on the management of the limitation of the system.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:27.840
Limitations are divided into two types, limitations in volumes and limitations in policy.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:35.840
If we talk about limitations in volumes, then our ability to make more money is limited by the physical resources inside our company.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:47.840
Management limitations take place when our ability to make more money is limited by some internal rules or procedures based on the wrong initial shipment

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.840
regarding how to manage or how to do business with customers for suppliers.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:07.840
Let's take the first type of limitation, limitations in volumes, and consider how the process of improving the organization should be carried out according to the logic of the world of throughput.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.840
The first is to find the limitation of the system.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.840
We must answer the question of what we lack and what we should do to make more money.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.840
The limitation can be internal, resource or external, market or supplier.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.840
Sometimes it is not easy to find a real limitation.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.840
The instability of the suboptimization created does not allow us to clearly see the whole picture.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.840
For this, we need to stabilize the system.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:37.840
The second step of the GovDrat system is to decide how to maximize the use of this limitation.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:44.840
Maximizing the use does not mean the complete exhaustion of the resource or its exploitation, which will lead to its resolution.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:56.840
This means the discharge of the resource from the task, which can be performed by other resources, or the elimination of variations and stops of the process, caused by the lack of proper focus.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.840
The third step is to fix the entire main system to the above-mentioned solution.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.840
This will require a very difficult struggle, primarily with the mentality of local optimum.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.840
This is the stage at which most of the limitations in politics are revealed.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.840
They must be replaced by new rules, the rules of synchronized flow.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:22.840
When we have achieved the full use of the existing system in the first three steps,

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.840
it is time to find a way to increase the limiting power.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.840
The next step is to develop the limitation of the system.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:47.840
If the limitation is inside the system, we must invest in the limitation, or add people, or find alternative ways to compensate for the power of the resources we use.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:55.840
If the limitation is on the market, we must create a mutually beneficial offer for the supplier, from which they will not be able to refuse.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:02.840
The process of improving the entire chain by improving one specific link has its logical end.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.840
We have made this link strong enough, and we must take the next step.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.840
That is, we must take five steps again.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.840
If the limitation was eliminated during the previous step, we will return to step number one.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.840
Dear colleagues, I will be very pleased, and I think it will be useful for you,

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:39.840
if you read the basics of the limitation theory in detail in the workbook.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.840
Now let's summarize the results of our course today.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:51.840
We have considered the main areas of the placement of production and service facilities,

01:04:52.840 --> 01:05:02.840
the placement of processes, we have seen what J.F. Forrester's work in the field of industrial dynamics is,

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.840
and how this theory, which was born 50 years ago, is relevant today.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:15.840
We have touched on the main areas of the limitation theory of Eliahu Gowdrat,

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.840
which, in my opinion, is one of the most effective modern systems.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.840
Thank you very much for your attention. I hope we will meet again.
