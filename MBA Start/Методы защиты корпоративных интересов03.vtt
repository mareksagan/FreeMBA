WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
What is the next block?

00:03.760 --> 00:10.200
The next topic, the next block that we will consider is information security.

00:10.200 --> 00:18.000
Information security, I have already said, is a state of security of information resources of a company

00:18.000 --> 00:27.680
achieved by means of a set of measures, I draw your attention to the set of measures, aimed at the protection of information.

00:27.680 --> 00:37.680
If we are writing down information resources, here is the information,

00:37.680 --> 00:51.680
it is divided into two large groups, these are open information resources,

00:51.680 --> 01:04.680
that is, information resources that have no access restrictions.

01:04.680 --> 01:09.680
As a rule, it is regulated by the law on the means of mass information,

01:09.680 --> 01:17.680
and everything that concerns open information resources is not subject to information security.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.680
And this is an information resource with limited access.

01:22.680 --> 01:32.680
Let's call it that way, information with limited access.

01:32.680 --> 01:40.680
Information with limited access is divided into two large groups,

01:40.680 --> 01:55.680
this is state secret, this is confidential information.

01:55.680 --> 02:05.680
Confidential information.

02:05.680 --> 02:11.680
This is at the level of state information resources.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.680
State secret is clear, there is a law on state secrets,

02:15.680 --> 02:19.680
certain licenses are required, certain rules must be observed,

02:19.680 --> 02:23.680
this is not a subject of our classes, our seminars.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.680
Confidential information.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.680
What is confidential information?

02:27.680 --> 02:35.680
There is a presidential decree, 188, on the approval of the list of confidential information,

02:35.680 --> 02:39.680
where it is written what confidential information is.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.680
What is confidential information?

02:44.680 --> 02:52.680
The first is personal data.

02:52.680 --> 02:58.680
This is information about the facts, events and circumstances in a citizen's private life,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.680
which allows you to identify his personality.

03:00.680 --> 03:07.680
Just six months ago, the law on personal data was introduced,

03:07.680 --> 03:13.680
where the rules of the game are prescribed on the market of personal data.

03:13.680 --> 03:19.680
Personal data is protected,

03:19.680 --> 03:25.680
and those organizations that face personal data must protect personal data.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.680
In principle, any employer faces personal data,

03:29.680 --> 03:35.680
so any employer must take measures to protect personal data of its employees.

03:35.680 --> 03:43.680
There are articles in the Labor Code on personal data,

03:43.680 --> 03:47.680
or rather on the protection of personal data of the employer.

03:47.680 --> 03:55.680
Unfortunately, we must note that personal data is not well protected,

03:55.680 --> 04:01.680
so a large number of personal data in semi-legal form is presented on the market

04:01.680 --> 04:05.680
as part of some kind of personal data.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.680
Nevertheless, this is an objective reality,

04:07.680 --> 04:11.680
and I think that in time, order will be established here.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.680
What is it?

04:13.680 --> 04:21.680
This is a commercial secret.

04:21.680 --> 04:27.680
I will talk about the commercial secret in more detail later.

04:27.680 --> 04:33.680
There is a commercial secret law,

04:33.680 --> 04:41.680
that is, there are rules of the game regarding how the commercial secret should be kept.

04:41.680 --> 04:49.680
It should be borne in mind that any commercial structure can have a commercial secret.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.680
This is legal information that represents a commercial value,

04:53.680 --> 04:59.680
and this information can be in the company.

04:59.680 --> 05:05.680
The next one is the so-called service secret.

05:05.680 --> 05:13.680
This is a service secret.

05:13.680 --> 05:19.680
There is a concept of a service secret,

05:19.680 --> 05:25.680
but unfortunately, there is no law on the service secret at the legislative level,

05:25.680 --> 05:31.680
so you can only guess what a service secret is.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.680
In fact, this is information of state bodies,

05:35.680 --> 05:39.680
which are subject to the closure of state bodies,

05:39.680 --> 05:41.680
but do not fall under the regime of the state secret.

05:41.680 --> 05:47.680
In a simplified version, this is the so-called DSP bar for service use.

05:47.680 --> 05:53.680
As a rule, the service secret is related to the work of state bodies.

05:53.680 --> 05:59.680
What else falls under confidential information?

05:59.680 --> 06:05.680
Under confidential information, there are so-called professional secrets.

06:05.680 --> 06:13.680
Professional secret.

06:13.680 --> 06:19.680
Professional secret is where there is a certain profession.

06:19.680 --> 06:25.680
At the legislative level, there are about 15 types of secrets related to certain professions.

06:25.680 --> 06:33.680
The most common are the notary secret, the lawyer's secret, the medical secret, and so on.

06:33.680 --> 06:39.680
This is also a section of confidential information.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.680
This is a confidential matter of the shipyard.

06:43.680 --> 07:11.680
This is confidential information about the essence of the invention,

07:11.680 --> 07:15.680
the use of the model or industrial sample.

07:15.680 --> 07:25.680
This is so-called confidential information.

07:25.680 --> 07:31.680
I will stop at the commercial secret.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.680
This is a direction of activity.

07:35.680 --> 07:43.680
Many organizations are forming a commercial secret regime.

07:43.680 --> 07:49.680
This activity arose after the adoption of the commercial secret law.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.680
There are already certain developments that can be shared.

07:53.680 --> 08:07.680
I will write it in abbreviated form.

08:07.680 --> 08:19.680
The commercial secret.

08:19.680 --> 08:27.680
The commercial secret appeared not yesterday and not 10 years ago.

08:27.680 --> 08:33.680
At the level of the Russian state, before the revolution, there was a concept of a production secret.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.680
In fact, this is a commercial secret.

08:37.680 --> 08:43.680
After the revolution of 1917, there was a concept of a commercial secret.

08:43.680 --> 08:49.680
Commercial activity was developed during the NEP.

08:49.680 --> 08:59.680
After the NEP, when commercial activity ceased to exist, the concept of a commercial secret was abolished.

08:59.680 --> 09:05.680
In 1990, when a new regulatory base was created,

09:05.680 --> 09:11.680
when the law on the basis of business activity in the USSR was adopted,

09:11.680 --> 09:17.680
the concept of a commercial secret was born.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.680
The Civil Code has an entire article on the commercial secret.

09:21.680 --> 09:29.680
This article regulates the existence of a commercial secret,

09:29.680 --> 09:35.680
the possibility of protecting the commercial secret in all legal ways,

09:35.680 --> 09:41.680
and the responsibility for the disclosure of the commercial secret.

09:41.680 --> 09:47.680
These are the three fundamental points that are in the Civil Code on the commercial secret.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.680
At the level of the law, this problem also arose in the 1990s.

09:51.680 --> 09:57.680
Somewhere in 1998, the commercial secret bill existed.

09:57.680 --> 10:05.680
It was not fully implemented.

10:05.680 --> 10:11.680
The commercial secret law was implemented only in 2004,

10:11.680 --> 10:17.680
when it was signed by the President.

10:17.680 --> 10:23.680
What does it say?

10:23.680 --> 10:29.680
What do I want to draw your attention to when we talk about the commercial secret law?

10:29.680 --> 10:37.680
There are some fundamental points that you should know if you are going to create a commercial secret regime.

10:37.680 --> 10:43.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

10:43.680 --> 10:51.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

10:51.680 --> 10:59.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

10:59.680 --> 11:07.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

11:07.680 --> 11:13.680
What is it about?

11:13.680 --> 11:21.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

11:21.680 --> 11:29.680
The information that constitutes a commercial secret must be recorded on material media.

11:29.680 --> 11:37.680
If it is not recorded on material media, you cannot create a commercial secret regime.

11:37.680 --> 11:45.680
Material media can be either paper media or electronic media.

11:45.680 --> 11:53.680
Electronic media must be recorded on material media.

11:53.680 --> 12:01.680
It can be floppy disks, hard drives, hard drives, anything.

12:01.680 --> 12:09.680
The second point is the legal way to obtain a commercial secret.

12:09.680 --> 12:19.680
The second point is the legal way to obtain a commercial secret.

12:19.680 --> 12:25.680
It has always been believed that a commercial secret can be stolen,

12:25.680 --> 12:31.680
that it can be obtained in some illegal way.

12:31.680 --> 12:37.680
A commercial secret is a commodity that can be bought or sold.

12:37.680 --> 12:43.680
It can be obtained as a result of systematic investigations.

12:43.680 --> 12:51.680
The third point is what cannot be a commercial secret.

12:51.680 --> 12:57.680
It cannot be a commercial secret.

12:57.680 --> 13:07.680
Countries in the world have developed in two different ways.

13:07.680 --> 13:13.680
Some countries have decided what can be a commercial secret.

13:13.680 --> 13:19.680
The law states that information about this or that can be a commercial secret.

13:19.680 --> 13:25.680
Other countries, including Russia, have taken a different path.

13:25.680 --> 13:31.680
We have decided on the level of the law, before that there was a government resolution,

13:31.680 --> 13:37.680
and we have decided to keep our commercial secrets as an exception.

13:37.680 --> 13:43.680
It is considered a more democratic method.

13:43.680 --> 13:49.680
However, when this problem first arose in the early 1990s,

13:49.680 --> 13:55.680
it was not clear what a commercial secret should be.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.680
What cannot be a commercial secret?

13:59.680 --> 14:09.680
The first thing that cannot be a commercial secret is identification data.

14:09.680 --> 14:17.680
Identification data.

14:17.680 --> 14:23.680
All the information about identification data can be a set of documents,

14:23.680 --> 14:29.680
documents confirming the registration of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs

14:29.680 --> 14:35.680
in accordance with the Regulations of the State, documents giving the right to engage in entrepreneurial activity,

14:35.680 --> 14:41.680
that is, licenses, a list of individuals who have the right to act without confidence, and so on.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.680
The next point is what cannot be a commercial secret.

14:45.680 --> 14:51.680
As far as I understand, identification data never tries to be a commercial secret,

14:51.680 --> 14:57.680
on the contrary, all licenses and patents are put in a frame somewhere in plain sight.

14:57.680 --> 15:05.680
Everything that concerns workers and working conditions.

15:05.680 --> 15:19.680
Information about workers and working conditions in commercial and non-commercial organizations cannot be a commercial secret.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.680
What is it about? The number of workers, the availability of free jobs,

15:23.680 --> 15:28.680
the system of labor payment, labor conditions, labor security,

15:28.680 --> 15:34.680
the employment of employers on the basis of salary payment, social payments,

15:34.680 --> 15:36.680
the indicators of production trauma, and so on.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.680
All this information cannot be a commercial secret.

15:39.680 --> 15:44.680
Here, the question usually arises about the labor payment system.

15:44.680 --> 15:51.680
That is, it is possible or impossible to make absolute figures, that is, a salary is a commercial secret.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.680
There are different approaches.

15:54.680 --> 15:59.680
In principle, the labor payment system can be quite simple,

15:59.680 --> 16:03.680
advance payment, payment and bonus.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.680
This cannot be a commercial secret.

16:05.680 --> 16:11.680
In principle, I think that you can make your commercial secrets in absolute quantities.

16:11.680 --> 16:17.680
The issue is quite controversial, even at the level of judicial decisions.

16:18.680 --> 16:37.680
Information about non-commercial organizations cannot be a commercial secret.

16:37.680 --> 16:43.680
The size of income and expenditure structures, the size of the total property, the use of unpaid labor, and so on.

16:44.680 --> 16:50.680
The point is that a commercial secret is not clearly tied to a commercial organization.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.680
A commercial secret can be in a state enterprise.

16:53.680 --> 17:00.680
Here, at the level of the law, it is not limited to the fact that a commercial secret is necessarily a commercial enterprise.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.680
Just terminology.

17:02.680 --> 17:17.680
Information about state enterprises, state enterprises, state enterprises, unitary enterprises and state institutions,

17:17.680 --> 17:23.680
the composition of property, the use of funds of appropriate budgets, conditions of competitions, auctions, and so on.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.680
Here is an interesting point.

17:25.680 --> 17:29.680
Everything related to information is related to the implementation of security requirements.

17:30.680 --> 17:40.680
The implementation of security requirements.

17:40.680 --> 17:45.680
What is this about?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.680
This is about the security of citizens.

17:47.680 --> 17:52.680
According to the logic of the law, corporate security is not taken into account.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.680
Security of all citizens is taken into account.

17:56.680 --> 18:05.680
Corporate security, security of the organization, security of the legal entity, is usually a commercial secret.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.680
This is some kind of classified information.

18:07.680 --> 18:12.680
We are talking about the security of citizens.

18:12.680 --> 18:20.680
Pollution of the environment, state of fire safety, sanitary, epidemiological and radiation situation.

18:21.680 --> 18:26.680
Roughly speaking, if there is a factory and it dumps some not very useful substances into the river,

18:26.680 --> 18:30.680
then the information that it does this cannot be a commercial secret.

18:30.680 --> 18:40.680
If some products are produced, that there are some not very useful products or ingredients for a person,

18:40.680 --> 18:43.680
information about this cannot be a commercial secret.

18:43.680 --> 18:47.680
Everything related to corporate security is usually a commercial secret.

18:48.680 --> 19:09.680
Information about violations of the law cannot be a commercial secret.

19:09.680 --> 19:15.680
Information about the obligation to disclose them or the inability to restrict them is established by various federal laws.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.680
Everything else can be a commercial secret.

19:20.680 --> 19:30.680
Generally, there are some methods of determining a commercial secret.

19:30.680 --> 19:44.680
At the level of our law on commercial secrets, ideology is all that is allowed and all that is not prohibited.

19:44.680 --> 19:49.680
Therefore, the method exists, such a concept as a total method.

19:49.680 --> 19:55.680
Although in practice, as far as I know, it is practically not applied, but in general, it exists.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.680
How does the situation work?

19:58.680 --> 20:01.680
All the information resources of the company are taken,

20:01.680 --> 20:06.680
from there information resources that cannot be a commercial secret are taken out,

20:06.680 --> 20:10.680
everything related to open information is removed,

20:10.680 --> 20:14.680
because it makes no sense to close information that can be obtained in the open.

20:14.680 --> 20:20.680
The state secret is removed, some other information is removed, and everything else is done in a commercial secret.

20:21.680 --> 20:26.680
This is a total method, all the information that can be disclosed.

20:26.680 --> 20:37.680
As a rule, this is a very expensive event, and rarely any companies can afford to close their information resources.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.680
Therefore, other methods are usually used,

20:42.680 --> 20:46.680
or there is such a concept as the plagiarism method.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.680
What does the plagiarism mean?

20:52.680 --> 21:02.680
It assumes that there is such a concept as a plagiarism, that is, a methodology, I would say.

21:03.680 --> 21:09.680
A company is taken, which is approximately similar to yours in terms of volume,

21:09.680 --> 21:15.680
in terms of the number of people, in terms of the produced product or provided services.

21:15.680 --> 21:23.680
If there is a commercial secret mode, then it is looked at and determined what is done in that company.

21:23.680 --> 21:30.680
And do the same thing in your company, because the companies work on the same market.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.680
It is widely used.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.680
There is a method called the expert method.

21:41.680 --> 21:47.680
Expert, as a rule, is the attraction of experts, that is, the attraction of specialists from the outside.

21:49.680 --> 21:53.680
And there is a method called the analytical method.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.680
Analytical.

21:59.680 --> 22:09.680
That is, a certain analysis of the company's activities is carried out from the point of view of what is necessary to do in a commercial secret.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.680
Basically, the analytical method is based on what?

22:13.680 --> 22:19.680
It is based on what interests the competitor.

22:25.680 --> 22:31.680
That is, they try to put themselves in the shoes of competitors and try to understand what can interest the competitor.

22:31.680 --> 22:35.680
And the second direction of the analytical method is what will cause damage.

22:40.680 --> 22:44.680
That is, we try to understand what information can damage the disclosure.

22:44.680 --> 22:51.680
Based on this, they try to determine what information should be included in the commercial secret.

22:51.680 --> 22:57.680
From these methods, the first, second and fourth, this company can do it on its own.

22:57.680 --> 23:06.680
The third method, that is, the attraction of experts, is that you find an organization, pay them money, and based on these three methods, they try to determine everything.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.680
This is based on methods.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.680
Now the next point.

23:15.680 --> 23:19.680
The law, if we analyze it this way, is very organizational.

23:19.680 --> 23:32.680
That is, you will not find any innovations there, you will not find any rigidly regulating things applicable to your company.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.680
It is very organizational.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.680
That is, it is general and very organizational.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.680
That is, rights, duties, what can be done, what cannot be done.

23:39.680 --> 23:45.680
Naturally, each company creates its own commercial secret regime and creates it for itself.

23:45.680 --> 23:49.680
Here, by the way, is a very subtle point that I would like to draw your attention to.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.680
At least, many companies face this.

23:52.680 --> 24:04.680
If you have to pass your commercial secret to some other organization, within the framework of something, within the framework of consulting, within the framework of some kind of contractual cooperation,

24:04.680 --> 24:10.680
keep in mind that the commercial secret regime in another organization can be completely different.

24:10.680 --> 24:17.680
Unlike, say, the state secret regime, which is unified at all enterprises, where there are state secrets, and throughout Russia.

24:17.680 --> 24:25.680
The commercial secret regime is unique, it is individual, it is created directly in each company, and is approved by the management of the company.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.680
In your company, the commercial secret regime can be very strong and very serious.

24:29.680 --> 24:37.680
You will pass it on to some other company, there may be a completely different regime, and everything may be completely different, much worse.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.680
Therefore, keep this in mind.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.680
And, in principle, I would not recommend passing commercial secrets anywhere.

24:44.680 --> 24:51.680
That is, you can talk about the serious preservation of commercial secrets only when these commercial secrets are with you.

24:51.680 --> 25:02.680
As soon as you pass your commercial secrets somewhere, you can very conditionally say that these commercial secrets will be protected or preserved.

25:02.680 --> 25:18.680
Another point I would like to emphasize is the relationship between enterprises and various state bodies within the framework of the commercial secret regime.

25:18.680 --> 25:26.680
It is clear that there are controlling law enforcement agencies that can come to the company and carry out some actions.

25:26.680 --> 25:33.680
This can be within the framework of inspection activities, it can be within the framework of investigative activities, it can be within the framework of operational activities.

25:33.680 --> 25:39.680
It is pointless and impossible to protect yourself from this with the help of commercial secrets,

25:39.680 --> 25:50.680
simply because, according to our legislation, you must provide information on the motivated requirements of these state bodies, including the component of the commercial secret.

25:50.680 --> 25:57.680
This will not limit or limit various inspections.

25:57.680 --> 26:07.680
Another thing is that if you provide your commercial secrets to state bodies, they take on the obligation to preserve your commercial secrets.

26:07.680 --> 26:20.680
The next point I would like to draw your attention to is the so-called commercial secret regime.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.680
The regime of the CT.

26:25.680 --> 26:30.680
It is impossible to say that we have a commercial secret or not.

26:30.680 --> 26:42.680
You can say that there is a commercial secret regime only when you conduct a number of events that will allow you to say that you have a commercial secret regime.

26:42.680 --> 26:46.680
And, of course, all the consequences resulting from this.

26:47.680 --> 26:56.680
I have already said, I emphasize again, that the commercial secret regime is an individual event.

26:56.680 --> 27:02.680
The commercial secret regime is individual for each company and it can be different in different companies.

27:02.680 --> 27:06.680
The commercial secret regime is determined by the company's manager.

27:06.680 --> 27:12.680
That is, he approves certain documents that say what the commercial secret regime is and how it will be implemented.

27:13.680 --> 27:20.680
There is no maximum list of events on the commercial secret regime.

27:20.680 --> 27:27.680
There is a minimum number of events that you have to do to say that you have a commercial secret regime.

27:27.680 --> 27:32.680
This minimum is listed in the law of the commercial secret regime.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.680
I will now talk about them in more detail.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.680
There is no maximum, of course.

27:36.680 --> 27:42.680
According to the Civil Code and the law of the commercial secret regime,

27:42.680 --> 27:49.680
a company can implement any legal methods and methods of protecting its commercial secrets.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.680
I emphasize, legal methods, but any.

27:52.680 --> 27:57.680
What is the minimum on the commercial secret regime?

27:57.680 --> 27:59.680
What is the minimum that must be done?

27:59.680 --> 28:04.680
The first is to determine the information component of the commercial secret.

28:04.680 --> 28:14.680
The first is to determine the information component of the commercial secret.

28:14.680 --> 28:19.680
That is, you must determine what your commercial secret is.

28:19.680 --> 28:23.680
There are certain subtleties and difficulties.

28:23.680 --> 28:27.680
How does it usually happen?

28:27.680 --> 28:35.680
Usually, the security service is tasked with creating a list of information components of the commercial secret.

28:35.680 --> 28:42.680
The security service usually sends out letters to the structural units asking for suggestions

28:42.680 --> 28:47.680
on including some information components in the section of the commercial secret.

28:47.680 --> 28:53.680
The unit is based on the fact that the more information is hidden, the better.

28:53.680 --> 29:02.680
The security service composes and analyzes all this,

29:02.680 --> 29:05.680
and throws out at least half of it,

29:05.680 --> 29:11.680
because it makes no sense to hide information resources that can be openly available.

29:11.680 --> 29:19.680
Therefore, they usually try to protect the most serious and potentially significant information.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.680
If this succeeds, then they will expand this list of information.

29:23.680 --> 29:29.680
Therefore, as a recommendation, if you are going to do the commercial secret regime,

29:29.680 --> 29:34.680
try to close the smallest part of your information resources.

29:34.680 --> 29:38.680
This may not be very expensive and easy to organize.

29:38.680 --> 29:42.680
If you succeed, then try to expand this list.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.680
No one forbids you to periodically revise it, expand it, narrow it down.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.680
It's up to you.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.680
What will you face here?

29:51.680 --> 29:56.680
The list of information components of the commercial secret is usually information about.

29:56.680 --> 30:05.680
This is some information about what information is subject to closure.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.680
Usually, this is 1, 2, maximum 3 pages.

30:08.680 --> 30:13.680
The difficulty is to determine what is under these information.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.680
You can close the company's plan documents.

30:17.680 --> 30:21.680
The plan document of the company is the commercial secret.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.680
This is information that is subject to closure.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.680
Then there should be a person, a person in office,

30:26.680 --> 30:31.680
who would determine what documents are distributed to these plan documents of the company.

30:31.680 --> 30:37.680
In the list, it can be one item, but in reality, it can be hundreds, thousands of documents.

30:37.680 --> 30:41.680
Every day there will be a couple of dozen more documents.

30:41.680 --> 30:49.680
It is much more difficult to determine which documents are related to the company's plan documents.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.680
It is much more difficult.

30:51.680 --> 30:58.680
Determining the information component of the commercial secret and, of course, its approval of this list.

30:58.680 --> 31:04.680
It is usually approved either by order, the classic form, that is, the order of the company's manager.

31:04.680 --> 31:09.680
Such information about this, about that, is related to the commercial secret.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.680
This is a classic option.

31:12.680 --> 31:16.680
Sometimes this option is used, it is just an approval signature.

31:16.680 --> 31:22.680
That is, I approve, there is a general director, where the list of information components of the commercial secret will also be listed.

31:22.680 --> 31:29.680
This is the first thing to do to determine the commercial secret regime.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.680
The second thing that is usually done.

31:32.680 --> 31:41.680
In the law, this is a huge set of measures.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.680
This is a restriction of access to information.

31:44.680 --> 31:51.680
Restriction of access to information.

31:51.680 --> 32:04.680
This is a whole set of measures, including personnel, organizational, regime, technical, and other things,

32:04.680 --> 32:07.680
concerning the restriction of access to information.

32:07.680 --> 32:13.680
That is, you have determined that some information is a commercial secret, and then you must restrict access to this information.

32:13.680 --> 32:21.680
If this is a small number of documents or a small number of information resources, this can be done.

32:21.680 --> 32:26.680
As soon as these information resources take up half of the company's information resources,

32:26.680 --> 32:31.680
this is very difficult, very expensive, and usually it is simply not feasible.

32:31.680 --> 32:37.680
Therefore, in any case, if you have a leak of information,

32:37.680 --> 32:44.680
you will have to prove that you have restricted access to this information.

32:44.680 --> 32:51.680
Here is a criminal, he committed a crime and violated your access restriction system.

32:51.680 --> 32:57.680
That is, if you determine that the company's plan documents are a commercial secret,

32:57.680 --> 33:01.680
and these papers are printed out, lying around,

33:01.680 --> 33:07.680
then you don't have to talk about the commercial secret regime, because no one will do any hacking.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.680
That is, the information will be lost in any case.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.680
This is the second restriction of access to information.

33:13.680 --> 33:29.680
The third restriction of access to information is the solution of personnel problems.

33:30.680 --> 33:34.680
What is it usually?

33:34.680 --> 33:40.680
This is the definition of the people you will trust the information.

33:40.680 --> 33:47.680
The definition of the circle of persons.

33:47.680 --> 33:56.680
That is, the definition of those people you will trust your commercial secrets.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.680
There can be not many of them,

33:59.680 --> 34:03.680
you usually define certain people, personally,

34:03.680 --> 34:06.680
for example, Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov, have access to commercial secrets.

34:06.680 --> 34:17.680
Moreover, it is not necessary to allow a person to access all your commercial information.

34:17.680 --> 34:24.680
We are talking about permission to commercial secrets only within the framework of fulfilling your duties.

34:24.680 --> 34:27.680
If this is a financial person, then everything that concerns finances.

34:27.680 --> 34:30.680
If this is a technologist, then everything that concerns technology.

34:30.680 --> 34:33.680
But you have to define the circle of persons.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.680
And this circle of persons must be officially approved.

34:36.680 --> 34:44.680
Basically, it is determined through an order that Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov are allowed to access official or commercial information.

34:44.680 --> 34:50.680
These employees must take obligations.

34:50.680 --> 34:52.680
Take obligations.

34:52.680 --> 35:03.680
Take obligations to keep commercial secrets.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.680
That is, you have defined a person,

35:05.680 --> 35:10.680
after that, a person must take obligations to keep commercial secrets.

35:10.680 --> 35:15.680
But usually, what are the options for taking obligations?

35:15.680 --> 35:22.680
They can be taken, for example, within the framework of labor relations, within the framework of a labor agreement,

35:22.680 --> 35:27.680
where one of the parameters is laid down that the preservation of the secrets is protected by the law,

35:27.680 --> 35:30.680
which has become known within the framework of fulfilling the duties of the employee.

35:30.680 --> 35:35.680
This can be a separate agreement or a separate agreement on the preservation of commercial secrets.

35:35.680 --> 35:41.680
By analogy, there is a contract on the preservation of the bank secret.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.680
In legal systems, this blank exists.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.680
It is taken approximately by analogy.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.680
That is, a person takes obligations.

35:49.680 --> 35:54.680
Moreover, I would recommend to conclude a separate agreement, a separate agreement,

35:54.680 --> 35:58.680
simply because in a separate agreement, a separate agreement,

35:58.680 --> 36:02.680
you can describe in great detail, let's say, many points.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.680
In particular, what is understood under the disclosure of a commercial secret.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.680
That is, this is a rather specific thing.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.680
And what is the disclosure of a commercial secret?

36:12.680 --> 36:21.680
There, again, from the point of view of psychological impact on a potential offender,

36:21.680 --> 36:28.680
that is, there is a certain psychological impact when a person concludes a separate agreement.

36:28.680 --> 36:32.680
And then criminal, administrative, labor and so on.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.680
This is more effective from the point of view of psychology.

36:35.680 --> 36:39.680
In a separate agreement, in a separate agreement,

36:39.680 --> 36:44.680
it can be prescribed that a person after dismissal keeps your commercial secrets.

36:44.680 --> 36:51.680
Moreover, if we read according to the law, then even by default there is a certain period,

36:51.680 --> 36:53.680
it is three years.

36:53.680 --> 36:57.680
That is, if a person has taken on himself the obligation to preserve a commercial secret,

36:57.680 --> 36:59.680
but did not prescribe it for what period,

36:59.680 --> 37:02.680
then by default it is considered that within three years after dismissal,

37:02.680 --> 37:05.680
the employee is obliged to keep your commercial secrets.

37:05.680 --> 37:09.680
In practice, let's say, it is quite difficult to control,

37:09.680 --> 37:12.680
and even more difficult to bring a person to responsibility.

37:12.680 --> 37:21.680
Therefore, if you want a person to keep your commercial secrets after dismissal,

37:21.680 --> 37:24.680
it is better to conclude a separate agreement,

37:24.680 --> 37:32.680
because the labor agreement is terminated with the termination of labor relations.

37:32.680 --> 37:38.680
And there, as a rule, it is difficult to apply the norms

37:38.680 --> 37:43.680
regarding what happens after termination of labor relations.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.680
Therefore, it is better to conclude a separate agreement.

37:45.680 --> 37:49.680
In any case, such obligations in one form or another must be taken.

37:50.680 --> 38:00.680
So, the framework of the issue, the solution is that employees must know what the commercial secret is.

38:00.680 --> 38:09.680
That is, a person takes on the obligation to preserve a commercial secret,

38:09.680 --> 38:15.680
he must be informed that the information that we trust you with is a commercial secret.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.680
And he must sign it.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.680
That is, any action must be signed.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.680
He takes on the obligation, he must sign it.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.680
He is pleased with what is a commercial secret, he must sign it.

38:28.680 --> 38:33.680
And in relation to personnel issues, I will probably also draw your attention to the fact that

38:33.680 --> 38:49.680
it is very important to create conditions for employees to perform the commercial secret regime.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.680
What is it?

38:52.680 --> 38:58.680
As a rule, if a commercial secret regime is created, a certain normative base is formed,

38:58.680 --> 39:02.680
instructions are created, where it is clearly regulated what can be done, what cannot be done.

39:02.680 --> 39:06.680
This is applicable to specific people, to specific official duties.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.680
This is the first thing.

39:08.680 --> 39:17.680
And the second thing is that if you prescribe that an employee must store a commercial document,

39:17.680 --> 39:22.680
a document that constitutes a commercial secret, in a safe, then you must at least put this safe in it.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.680
These are obvious things.

39:24.680 --> 39:29.680
Nevertheless, this is also a certain commercial secret regime that must be.

39:30.680 --> 39:42.680
The next thing, everything that concerns the commercial secret regime, is the regulation of relations with counteragents.

39:42.680 --> 39:50.680
Let's call it the regulation of contractual relations.

39:50.680 --> 40:00.680
What is it about?

40:00.680 --> 40:02.680
The regulation of contractual relations.

40:02.680 --> 40:10.680
If you transfer your commercial secrets to other organizations within the framework of some work,

40:10.680 --> 40:15.680
then in the contract on the basis of which you provide this information,

40:15.680 --> 40:22.680
you must prescribe that another organization, where you transfer all this, must keep your commercial secrets,

40:22.680 --> 40:30.680
apply all the measures of protection, you can prescribe that you can control the measures that another organization will apply.

40:30.680 --> 40:34.680
Always assume that the commercial secret regime is individual,

40:34.680 --> 40:40.680
and another organization may have a much worse regime, simply because they see it that way.

40:40.680 --> 40:44.680
This must also be done in a mandatory manner.

40:44.680 --> 40:51.680
And perhaps the last thing that concerns the commercial secret regime,

40:51.680 --> 40:56.680
the minimum that you must do, is the application of a distinctive neck to a material carrier.

40:56.680 --> 41:12.680
The application of a distinctive neck to a material carrier.

41:12.680 --> 41:16.680
Let's call it KT.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.680
Of course, I am decoding it.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.680
The commercial secret.

41:19.680 --> 41:24.680
As I said at the beginning, the commercial secret must be fixed on the material carriers.

41:24.680 --> 41:29.680
These material carriers, it can be a paper carrier, it can be an electronic carrier,

41:29.680 --> 41:33.680
they must have a certain restrictive neck.

41:33.680 --> 41:38.680
A regular restrictive neck is a commercial secret with an indication of whether it has this information,

41:38.680 --> 41:42.680
for legal entities, a full name and location,

41:42.680 --> 41:48.680
for individual entrepreneurs, the surname, name, address, citizen, who are an individual entrepreneur, a place of residence.

41:49.680 --> 41:54.680
This does not always suit companies,

41:54.680 --> 42:02.680
because as soon as a commercial secret appears on some paper,

42:02.680 --> 42:08.680
the employees immediately start thinking about how to sell this document to make money on it.

42:08.680 --> 42:14.680
Therefore, sometimes this is not applicable to some organizations, to some companies,

42:14.680 --> 42:18.680
but in principle, it is legally obligatory.

42:18.680 --> 42:27.680
Here is a list of events, a minimum of events that must be done to create a commercial secret.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.680
Here is another rather subtle point regarding the neck.

42:30.680 --> 42:37.680
At the legislative level, it is not determined whether this neck can be divided into some sub-necks.

42:37.680 --> 42:44.680
Confidential, strictly confidential, commercial secret, strictly commercial secret, special commercial secret.

42:44.680 --> 42:49.680
At the legislative level, this is not the case, so I would not recommend doing this,

42:49.680 --> 42:52.680
simply because it is not in the law.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.680
If there are any problems and a judicial decision is required,

42:56.680 --> 42:59.680
then there may be different approaches to these problems.

43:00.680 --> 43:04.680
Now, the next point.

43:04.680 --> 43:07.680
The commercial secret has certain characteristics.

43:07.680 --> 43:11.680
The characteristics of a commercial secret are its commercial value,

43:11.680 --> 43:16.680
that is, you cannot hide information that is not a commercial value for you.

43:16.680 --> 43:20.680
Although the approach is quite individual, for different companies,

43:20.680 --> 43:23.680
the commercial value may have different information,

43:23.680 --> 43:26.680
that is, different information may have different commercial value.

43:26.680 --> 43:29.680
This is inaccessibility, this is mandatory,

43:29.680 --> 43:35.680
that is, you must restrict access to information in a mandatory manner.

43:35.680 --> 43:41.680
This is security, that is, a certain commercial secret regime must be created.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.680
This is an unlimited security period.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.680
Here is a rather subtle point,

43:45.680 --> 43:48.680
due to the fact that at the legislative level,

43:48.680 --> 43:54.680
the period during which you create a commercial secret regime is not specified.

43:54.680 --> 43:58.680
It can be a year, it can be half a year, it can be one day.

43:58.680 --> 44:01.680
That is, you can create a commercial secret regime for one day.

44:01.680 --> 44:05.680
You can create a commercial secret regime for 100 years,

44:05.680 --> 44:07.680
that is, depending on the need,

44:07.680 --> 44:13.680
unlike, say, some other restrictive rights,

44:13.680 --> 44:17.680
in the form of copyright, there is a clear, definite period.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.680
The commercial secret period is not defined,

44:20.680 --> 44:23.680
it is up to the company's managers.

44:29.680 --> 44:31.680
Now the question arises,

44:31.680 --> 44:34.680
what does it usually mean to have a commercial secret?

44:34.680 --> 44:38.680
I have already mentioned some methods that exist.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.680
There are certain approaches.

44:41.680 --> 44:48.680
What should we attribute to a commercial secret?

44:51.680 --> 44:53.680
As far as I understand,

44:53.680 --> 44:59.680
this problem is usually a technology.

45:03.680 --> 45:07.680
If the company has some technologies,

45:07.680 --> 45:09.680
so-called know-how,

45:09.680 --> 45:13.680
that is, some technological innovations,

45:13.680 --> 45:15.680
that is, technological moments,

45:15.680 --> 45:18.680
then, as a rule, if a commercial secret regime is created,

45:18.680 --> 45:20.680
it is necessarily included there.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.680
This can be,

45:28.680 --> 45:32.680
let's say, some kind of management information.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.680
Management information.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.680
Management information.

45:41.680 --> 45:44.680
That is, everything that concerns management issues.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.680
I have already mentioned this.

45:47.680 --> 45:50.680
This is all about the company's plans.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.680
First of all, this refers to some kind of strategic plan,

45:53.680 --> 45:58.680
that is, strategic development plans, and everything else.

46:00.680 --> 46:03.680
This is all about financial issues.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.680
Financial.

46:07.680 --> 46:12.680
There are things that you have to introduce

46:12.680 --> 46:14.680
into the commercial secret regime.

46:14.680 --> 46:17.680
In particular, in the accounting law,

46:17.680 --> 46:19.680
if I'm not mistaken,

46:19.680 --> 46:24.680
accounting records should be related to confidential information.

46:26.680 --> 46:28.680
The rest of the things should be considered

46:28.680 --> 46:33.680
depending on the financial documents.

46:33.680 --> 46:35.680
This is analytics.

46:36.680 --> 46:42.680
Especially if you have an analytical unit in your company

46:42.680 --> 46:44.680
that analyzes the situation,

46:44.680 --> 46:49.680
that is, it can conduct some analytical work,

46:49.680 --> 46:52.680
make some analytical reports, documents.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.680
The results of these analytical studies,

46:54.680 --> 46:58.680
as a rule, belong to the commercial secret regime.

46:59.680 --> 47:04.680
Despite the fact that they can be obtained from open sources,

47:04.680 --> 47:07.680
that is, from the same mass media,

47:07.680 --> 47:12.680
they can already have limited access to do some analytical work.

47:13.680 --> 47:17.680
This is all about the information of negotiations.

47:20.680 --> 47:22.680
This includes who,

47:22.680 --> 47:25.680
or rather, what companies are negotiated with,

47:25.680 --> 47:28.680
what topic, what conditions, everything that concerns.

47:28.680 --> 47:31.680
Everything that concerns some kind of contracts,

47:31.680 --> 47:33.680
contracts in business relations.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.680
Pricing policy,

47:35.680 --> 47:37.680
it can be the terms of the contract,

47:37.680 --> 47:39.680
benefits, and everything else.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.680
There may be some other things.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.680
That is, naturally, each company,

47:45.680 --> 47:49.680
depending on what it does,

47:49.680 --> 47:52.680
it compiles its information

47:52.680 --> 47:54.680
related to the commercial secret.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.680
So...

48:00.680 --> 48:02.680
Well, here, probably,

48:02.680 --> 48:05.680
this is what I would like to emphasize again.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.680
Will you create the commercial secret regime?

48:08.680 --> 48:09.680
You will not.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.680
These are your questions.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.680
If you create the commercial secret regime,

48:13.680 --> 48:17.680
then try to close a very small amount of information first.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.680
If you succeed, then gradually expand.

48:19.680 --> 48:23.680
Because closing information is a rather expensive method.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.680
And, as a rule,

48:25.680 --> 48:29.680
not all companies can seriously approach this.

48:29.680 --> 48:32.680
And they cannot seriously allocate serious funds

48:32.680 --> 48:34.680
to protect, to close information.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.680
If it is half a percent of information resources,

48:37.680 --> 48:39.680
you can still close.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.680
If you are trying to close 30% of information resources,

48:42.680 --> 48:44.680
yes, it is possible, but it is very expensive.

48:46.680 --> 48:49.680
So, this is about the commercial secret.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.680
Well, in relation to the responsibility

48:51.680 --> 48:53.680
for disclosure of the commercial secret,

48:53.680 --> 48:55.680
I will not talk about it now,

48:55.680 --> 48:57.680
because I have already talked about it

48:57.680 --> 49:00.680
in the section called personnel security.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.680
So, here, probably,

49:02.680 --> 49:05.680
this is what I would like to focus on.

49:05.680 --> 49:10.680
So, this is about, let's say,

49:12.680 --> 49:17.680
in general, protection of information with limited access.

49:17.680 --> 49:20.680
So, all protection of information with limited access,

49:20.680 --> 49:24.680
in general, I have already said that it is complex.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.680
That is, you cannot protect information resources

49:27.680 --> 49:30.680
just with some piece.

49:30.680 --> 49:34.680
The forms in which the information is located

49:34.680 --> 49:36.680
are determined by means of these forms,

49:36.680 --> 49:40.680
the methods of protection of information are determined.

49:40.680 --> 49:44.680
So, as a rule, everything that concerns a complex solution,

49:44.680 --> 49:46.680
protection,

49:48.680 --> 49:53.680
is organizational measures,

49:56.680 --> 49:58.680
is legal measures,

50:02.680 --> 50:04.680
is technical measures.

50:08.680 --> 50:12.680
Technically, IT security measures are included here,

50:12.680 --> 50:16.680
and protection from channels of information leakage is included.

50:16.680 --> 50:20.680
This is a confidential matter of production,

50:24.680 --> 50:26.680
an official matter of production.

50:28.680 --> 50:33.680
And this is, let's call it, a regime event.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.680
A regime event.

50:40.680 --> 50:44.680
Now, in a nutshell,

50:44.680 --> 50:49.680
I would like to talk about a confidential matter of production,

50:49.680 --> 50:51.680
because I mentioned it,

50:51.680 --> 50:55.680
and now I will just remind you about a confidential matter of production.

50:55.680 --> 51:00.680
So, the question related to a confidential matter of production.

51:00.680 --> 51:03.680
This is also a component of IT security.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.680
As I said,

51:05.680 --> 51:08.680
this is one of the directions,

51:08.680 --> 51:13.680
some events are related to IT security.

51:13.680 --> 51:18.680
So, when does a confidential matter of production occur?

51:21.680 --> 51:24.680
A confidential matter of production.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.680
Naturally, it occurs, first of all,

51:30.680 --> 51:33.680
when some information is protected,

51:33.680 --> 51:35.680
this is clear.

51:35.680 --> 51:39.680
And the second, when confidential information is presented in the form of certain documents,

51:39.680 --> 51:43.680
they can be material, paper, electronic.

51:43.680 --> 51:48.680
The point is that these documents are created somewhere,

51:48.680 --> 51:51.680
they are moved somewhere, stored somewhere,

51:51.680 --> 51:53.680
some resolutions are applied to them,

51:53.680 --> 51:55.680
something is done on them,

51:55.680 --> 51:57.680
that is, when there are certain documents of circulation.

51:57.680 --> 51:59.680
If these two conditions coincide,

51:59.680 --> 52:03.680
then it is necessary to create a confidential matter of production.

52:03.680 --> 52:06.680
It consists of two parts,

52:06.680 --> 52:08.680
in such a classic version.

52:08.680 --> 52:13.680
This is all that concerns the material matter of production.

52:13.680 --> 52:15.680
Material.

52:15.680 --> 52:18.680
Confidential matter of production.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.680
Everything that concerns the electronic.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.680
Electronic.

52:22.680 --> 52:24.680
Confidential matter of production.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.680
Electronic.

52:27.680 --> 52:29.680
Confidential matter of production.

52:29.680 --> 52:33.680
It occurs only when there is such a concept as an electronic document.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.680
The concept of an electronic document can only be understood

52:36.680 --> 52:41.680
when the authorship and authenticity of this electronic document is carried out,

52:41.680 --> 52:44.680
that is, when the electronic digital signature is applied.

52:44.680 --> 52:48.680
If you do not apply an electronic digital signature in the company,

52:48.680 --> 52:53.680
then, in general, it is pointless to create an electronic confidential matter of production.

52:53.680 --> 52:56.680
It will no longer be an electronic matter of production,

52:56.680 --> 53:00.680
but an electronic copy of the material matter of production.

53:00.680 --> 53:02.680
As soon as the ECP arises,

53:02.680 --> 53:06.680
you can create an electronic confidential matter of production.

53:06.680 --> 53:10.680
Please note that there is a law on electronic digital signatures,

53:10.680 --> 53:13.680
where certain rules of the game with the ECP are defined.

53:13.680 --> 53:20.680
A law on information, information technologies and information protection has also been adopted recently,

53:21.680 --> 53:27.680
where the electronic digital signature is recognized as an analogue of the confidential signature.

53:27.680 --> 53:31.680
Both the document signed by the electronic digital signature

53:31.680 --> 53:37.680
and the document signed by the confidential signature have the same legal power.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.680
But regarding the electronic digital signature,

53:40.680 --> 53:44.680
we also note that this is not a protection of information.

53:44.680 --> 53:50.680
The goal of the electronic digital signature is to confirm the authorship and authenticity of the document.

53:50.680 --> 53:53.680
That is, protection should be built separately.

53:53.680 --> 53:56.680
This is not a means of protection, but a means of authorship and authenticity.

53:56.680 --> 54:00.680
Everything that concerns the material matter of production,

54:00.680 --> 54:03.680
it consists of two directions.

54:03.680 --> 54:06.680
This is everything that concerns the document of circulation.

54:06.680 --> 54:20.680
And this is everything that concerns the archive, the information storage.

54:20.680 --> 54:24.680
In the simplified version of the archive, it is like an archive.

54:24.680 --> 54:29.680
In the more complex version of the archive, there is only the concept of an active archive.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.680
That is, the documents are submitted there,

54:31.680 --> 54:34.680
and from there they can be obtained.

54:34.680 --> 54:39.680
And it is necessary to check whether there is permission for these documents,

54:39.680 --> 54:42.680
which are submitted to the archive, whether the documents are returned,

54:42.680 --> 54:45.680
whether copies are made of them, whether they are changed.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.680
That is, the so-called life of the archive.

54:47.680 --> 54:50.680
Confidential case of production.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.680
Before creating a confidential case of production,

54:56.680 --> 55:02.680
the game rules are usually determined by some round stones.

55:02.680 --> 55:05.680
In particular, what to determine.

55:08.680 --> 55:14.680
That is, what questions should be answered before creating a confidential case of production.

55:18.680 --> 55:25.680
The first thing to do, let's say, when creating a confidential case of production,

55:25.680 --> 55:34.680
is to determine who appropriates and removes the neck.

55:39.680 --> 55:42.680
This is a rather unimportant question,

55:42.680 --> 55:49.680
because you have determined that, for example, the planned documents of the company are a commercial secret.

55:50.680 --> 55:53.680
Then there should be some official who would determine

55:53.680 --> 55:56.680
what documents the company's planned documents contain,

55:56.680 --> 55:59.680
which documents to include in the confidential case of production.

55:59.680 --> 56:02.680
This is a rather difficult option.

56:02.680 --> 56:04.680
You can go along the way that,

56:04.680 --> 56:08.680
usually in small organizations, some official determines this.

56:08.680 --> 56:12.680
You can go along the way that the document's executor determines

56:12.680 --> 56:17.680
whether the confidential information of this document is confidential,

56:17.680 --> 56:20.680
whether to include it or not in the confidential case of production.

56:22.680 --> 56:35.680
So, let's say, what documents should be included in the confidential case of production.

56:37.680 --> 56:39.680
This is also an important question,

56:39.680 --> 56:42.680
because in the classic case,

56:42.680 --> 56:47.680
the documents containing or making up the commercial secret are included in the confidential case of production.

56:49.680 --> 56:56.680
But in practice, there are a lot of documents that need to be included in this confidential case of production.

56:56.680 --> 57:01.680
These are some strict reporting forms, some numbered documents and everything else.

57:02.680 --> 57:07.680
So, what kind of accounting is determined?

57:13.680 --> 57:15.680
What is it about?

57:15.680 --> 57:18.680
There are two options for accounting documents.

57:18.680 --> 57:23.680
It can be manual accounting or automated accounting.

57:23.680 --> 57:30.680
One of the distinguishing features of the confidential case of production is strict accounting control.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.680
Any document that is created,

57:33.680 --> 57:36.680
it is assigned a number, it must be registered,

57:36.680 --> 57:41.680
the number of copies that are taken from it must be determined,

57:41.680 --> 57:44.680
which officials can get acquainted with it.

57:44.680 --> 57:46.680
If Ivanov gave it to Petrov,

57:46.680 --> 57:51.680
it means that it is necessary to clearly record that at that time Ivanov gave the document to Petrov.

57:51.680 --> 57:53.680
That is, strict accounting control.

57:53.680 --> 57:57.680
It can be handled in a manual version,

57:57.680 --> 58:01.680
that is, in the form of various magazines, registers, notes, and so on.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.680
It can be handled in an electronic version.

58:03.680 --> 58:10.680
Now there are quite a lot of products that are handled in an electronic version of the confidential case of production.

58:13.680 --> 58:15.680
This must be determined.

58:15.680 --> 58:22.680
It is determined, let's say, how to create.

58:22.680 --> 58:24.680
How to create?

58:24.680 --> 58:27.680
It is about two options,

58:27.680 --> 58:34.680
separately or on the basis of the open one.

58:34.680 --> 58:39.680
It is clear that in any company there is an open case of production.

58:39.680 --> 58:41.680
There is a case of production gospel,

58:41.680 --> 58:45.680
where documents are written, how to design, how to create, how to send.

58:45.680 --> 58:50.680
The confidential case of production can be created on the basis of the open case of production,

58:50.680 --> 58:54.680
that is, some information sections are allocated, which are closed,

58:54.680 --> 58:56.680
safes are inserted, and so on.

58:56.680 --> 59:02.680
This is the first option, it is perhaps the simplest and most common.

59:02.680 --> 59:06.680
The second option is to create a confidential case of production separately,

59:06.680 --> 59:09.680
that is, in no way connected with the open case of production.

59:09.680 --> 59:12.680
This option is also possible, there are pluses and minuses,

59:12.680 --> 59:14.680
you need to proceed with a specific situation.

59:14.680 --> 59:18.680
What is determined?

59:19.680 --> 59:21.680
How are documents created?

59:21.680 --> 59:25.680
How and where are they created?

59:27.680 --> 59:29.680
Some premises are determined,

59:29.680 --> 59:32.680
where you can create a confidential case of production.

59:32.680 --> 59:37.680
The officials who can create documents are determined.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.680
The means of protection are established,

59:39.680 --> 59:43.680
technical means, all sorts of, say, alarms, and so on.

59:43.680 --> 59:49.680
It is determined how to store, how to create,

59:49.680 --> 59:56.680
how to create, how to store confidential documents.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.680
Well, the storage is generally clear,

59:58.680 --> 01:00:06.680
the main goal here is to make it so that the unauthorized persons

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.680
exclude access to these documents.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.680
Basically, these are either safes or systems,

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.680
say, some kind of metal cabinets.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.680
Everything depends on the need, value, and safety of these documents.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:29.680
In terms of storage, the moment of destruction of documents is determined.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.680
There are different approaches to destruction.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.680
The classic option is destruction in shredders,

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.680
special machines for shredding documents.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.680
They come in different classes.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.680
There are shredders that cut a sheet of paper only along,

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.680
and there are shredders that cut a sheet of paper not only along, but also across.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:02.680
There are shredders that are guaranteed not to be restored.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.680
That is, they cut such a small number of particles,

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.680
A4, in my opinion, for 15,000 parts.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:13.680
Basically, they cut a standard sheet of A4 into powder.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.680
I would recommend using shredders that are guaranteed not to be restored,

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.680
that is, those that cut not only along, but also across.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.680
If necessary, you can buy large shredders.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.680
There are shredders that can destroy a whole pack of papers at once.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.680
They are expensive, but the principle is the same.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.680
The same knives, just bigger, and the same motors, only more powerful.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.680
They are expensive, but if necessary, there are also such shredders.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.680
I would recommend setting up a rule in the company,

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:57.680
which says that any company documents should be destroyed using shredders.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.680
Because as soon as you start to determine that these documents can be put in a garbage basket,

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.680
these documents can be put in shredders,

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.680
usually, again, taking into account the human factor,

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.680
someone will confuse something, someone will throw something wrong.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:18.680
Therefore, it may make sense to determine that all documents are destroyed using shredders.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:28.680
And garbage baskets are intended for apple peels, banana peels, empty cans of beer, etc.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.680
Here is what I would like to draw your attention to in relation to the destruction of documents.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.680
This is a collegiality of destruction.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.680
It may make sense to make such a procedure in the organization,

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.680
that some confidential documents are destroyed collegially.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.680
That is, a commission is created,

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.680
this can be the executor of the document and the security service employee,

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:03.680
who is signed that this sheet of paper was not turned into a tube and not taken out,

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.680
but it was destroyed.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.680
This may be unacceptable in many companies,

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:17.680
because it is a bureaucratic procedure, it distracts the forces of the means.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.680
But in some situations and according to some confidential documents, this is probably possible.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.680
This is for destruction.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.680
You can destroy documents by burning,

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.680
although it is probably convenient when there are a lot of documents.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.680
If there are not many documents, it makes sense to use shredders.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:44.680
In relation to the destruction of documents, what else is determined?

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:53.680
As a rule, the order of the transfer of confidential documents is determined.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.680
Here, what I will draw your attention to,

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.680
in any case, there will be a need to transfer some confidential documents,

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.680
move some documents,

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.680
some documents will be taken by the management to work at home.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.680
Unfortunately, this is an objective reality.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.680
Ideally, the document should not go beyond the controlled room.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.680
But life is multifaceted, and this is why such situations arise.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.680
You can foresee such situations,

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.680
and it makes sense to determine some order of transferring documents from the controlled territory.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.680
In the vast majority of cases, a certain permission is required.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680
How is it determined?

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.680
A permission is required.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.680
The official who gives this permission is required.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.680
When moving between objects,

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:49.680
usually several people move the confidential document in their car.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.680
That is, a driver goes, a person with a document goes.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.680
It is forbidden for them to deviate from the route,

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.680
it is forbidden to take passengers,

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.680
it is forbidden to enter some five-star hotels.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.680
But there should be an order of transfer plus an order of movement.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:18.680
The order of movement is beyond the control zone.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:28.680
Usually, the order of transferring confidential documents is determined.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.680
The order of transferring confidential documents is about the provision,

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.680
for example, within the framework of some verification activities.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.680
We are talking about the creation of certain algorithms in action.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:55.680
For example, a tax office, a police, a fire brigade, or anyone else comes.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.680
They can require certain documents within the framework of verification activities.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:05.680
What is the order of providing these documents within the framework of verification activities?

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.680
This order must be regulated, determined.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.680
It should not go beyond the framework of the current legislation.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:17.680
But in order to regulate it, it is necessary to introduce a certain order,

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.680
that is, there must be some kind of instruction.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.680
Here you can include the order of providing information,

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.680
for example, in the Internet resource,

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.680
the order of providing confidential information,

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.680
for example, at some negotiations, at some exhibition events.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.680
That is, it is the confidential documents.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:44.680
And, probably, a certain control is determined.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.680
Control over the confidential production.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.680
Control can be…

01:06:52.680 --> 01:07:00.680
Well, I have already said that various control measures can go both planned and unplanned.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:05.680
Control over the copying and multiplying technique,

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:10.680
control over multiplication, printing, sending documents.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:16.680
Unfortunately, the modern office is flooded with various copying and multiplying techniques.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.680
Any confidential document does not imply unauthorized multiplication.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.680
Therefore, it is necessary to clearly track the number of copies made,

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.680
who met which copy and where they are.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.680
Therefore, there must be a certain control.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.680
Technical means are also included here.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.680
Control over the copying of information from the computer,

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.680
for example, on the movement of documents on the network,

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.680
on the sending of confidential documents,

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.680
for example, by email, and so on.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.680
I would probably include control here,

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:59.680
and the question of who will be subject to the confidential production.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:04.680
That is, the management of the company must have a certain designated official,

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.680
to whom the confidential production will be closed.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.680
That is, who will solve the issues of the confidential production.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.680
Because, as a rule, there are a lot of issues and problems in the confidential production,

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.680
which require solutions, including at the level of the management.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.680
This is the confidential production.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.680
When all these issues are determined,

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.680
the confidential production is created,

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.680
the necessary equipment is purchased,

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.680
the necessary regulatory documents are created,

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.680
personnel training is carried out,

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:47.680
and then this system, when properly operated, should work.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:54.680
Here, look at the automated systems of the confidential production on the market.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.680
They are presented, they are configured for a specific organization,

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.680
they can be sold as scramble systems.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.680
Therefore, the issues that are solved,

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:11.680
they must be solved in accordance with the answers to the issues that you have set for yourself.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.680
Economic security

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.680
The next topic that we will discuss is economic security.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.680
I will remind you that economic security,

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.680
economic security,

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.680
in fact, is the security of business processes that take place in the company.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.680
It is built in several directions.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.680
This is business intelligence.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.680
Business intelligence.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.680
This is information and analytical work.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.680
This is analysis and risk management.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.680
Economic risks.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.680
This is protection against fraud.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.680
Protection against fraud.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.680
This can be protection against hostile absorption.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.680
Hostile absorption.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.680
This can be protection against some illegal actions,

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.680
depending on the company's activities.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.680
If this is the financial sphere,

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.680
then protection against illegal actions,

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.680
such as non-return of loans,

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.680
with plastic cards,

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.680
with fraud in plastic cards, etc.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.680
This is more protection against fraud.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.680
Economic security.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.680
This topic is very extensive.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.680
I can talk for hours about economic security.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.680
I will probably stop at one direction,

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.680
and I will talk about business intelligence.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.680
Business intelligence.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.680
There are different interpretations.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.680
There is corporate intelligence,

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.680
there is competitive intelligence,

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.680
there is business intelligence.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.680
In fact, business intelligence is built in two directions.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.680
This is information work.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.680
This is analytical work.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.680
This is a kind of information collection,

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.680
and this is done exclusively by legal means.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.680
Business intelligence does not engage in illegal methods.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.680
Information collection is also industrial espionage.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.680
There may be non-ethical methods,

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.680
but legal ones.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.680
Analytical work is done from the point of view of business intelligence.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.680
There are two directions in business intelligence.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.680
The first direction is strategic.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.680
The second direction is operational.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.680
The third direction is strategic.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.680
What is a strategic direction?

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.680
It is a solution of strategic tasks

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.680
from the perspective of the security of the organization.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.680
What do I mean by strategic tasks?

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.680
This is the analysis of the legislation

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.680
from the point of view of a particular company,

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.680
that is, in the field of activity of a particular company.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.680
This is an analysis of the competitive environment,

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.680
that is, what companies exist in this market,

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.680
how they develop, what threats they pose.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.680
This is an analysis of the market as a whole,

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.680
the analysis of the possibility of the emergence of some products or substitutes,

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.680
the analysis of some resources of this market,

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.680
the analysis of the needs of this market.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.680
These are quite similar things

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.680
from the point of view of strategic planning.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.680
Although business intelligence

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.680
is about threats and risks.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.680
Strategic planning can come from the point of view of profit,

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.680
business intelligence comes from the point of view of threats.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.680
The operational direction is a private local direction.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.680
Usually, it is about checking a particular company,

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.680
a particular organization.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.680
You want to conclude an agreement with a particular organization,

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.680
you want to see what kind of organization it is,

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.680
what it is like,

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.680
whether it will pay for its obligations,

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.680
who is behind this company,

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.680
and how decent this company is.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.680
This is a so-called payment capability check,

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.680
or partner reliability.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.680
This is a local operational direction.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.680
Information is collected for negotiations.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.680
That is, it is planned to carry out some negotiations

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.680
with a person or an organization.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.680
Information is collected for negotiations.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.680
Or, in the vast majority of cases,

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.680
this is a collection of information before concluding a deal.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.680
If you work as a swordsman's watchman,

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.680
in a twelve-chair,

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.680
in the morning money, in the evening chair,

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.680
this is very relevant.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.680
If you work with the source,

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.680
that is, first you send money somewhere,

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.680
then you wait for some product,

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.680
or vice versa, you send a product,

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.680
then you wait for money,

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.680
then it makes sense to check

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.680
whether the organization will pay for the debts that do not exist.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.680
There are stages of business intelligence.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.680
I will dwell on them a little.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.680
The first stage is the task setting.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.680
The more correct and clear you set the task,

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.680
the easier and cheaper it will be

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.680
to go into business intelligence.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.680
Because the task must always be set clearly

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.680
based on the questions

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.680
you want to get an answer to.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.680
This is about the same as the lie detector test,

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.680
which I talked about in the security video.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.680
That is, you can't just test a person on a lie detector.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.680
As a rule, they test the answer to some questions.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.680
The same cannot be done

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.680
when you ask to collect all the information

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.680
from some company,

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.680
but it will be completely useless for use.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.680
That is, you need to set the task in the following way.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.680
Collect the information I need

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.680
to make a decision.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.680
The decision may be to sign a contract with this company

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.680
or not.

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.680
The information is collected and analytical work is carried out

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.680
from the point of view of the organization's payability.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.680
You need to pay attention to this

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.680
because you need to set the question very clearly and correctly.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.680
The second stage is the information collection.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.680
There are different methods of collecting information.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.680
I will talk about them in more detail.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.680
That is, they collect information

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.680
in various methods.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.680
The third stage is the evaluation of information.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.680
This is about translating it into information.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.680
Information is some kind of information.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.680
To make a decision, it is pointless to collect information.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.680
You need to collect it,

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.680
evaluate it and transfer the information to the data.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.680
The data is different from the information

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.680
because the data is already evaluated.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.680
The evaluation can take place in different directions.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.680
From the point of view of reliability,

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.680
completeness, relevance,

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.680
secrecy, reliability of the source and so on.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.680
The fourth stage is the analysis.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.680
After the information is translated into the data,

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.680
analytical work is carried out based on this data.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.680
Again, this is done to answer the questions

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.680
that are initially put in the task.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.680
The fifth stage is the preparation of conclusions.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.680
The preparation of conclusions is usually done

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.680
in the form of a certain document.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.680
This is an information-analytical note,

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.680
a reference.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.680
It is made up of two parts.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.680
This is the information part.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.680
The information that has been collected

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.680
is stated here.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.680
The information is then collected

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.680
and the information that has been collected is stated.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.680
This is either information or certain information.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.680
The part that is dedicated to the answers to those questions.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.680
The conclusions should be the answer

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.680
to the questions that were asked.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.680
Here you need to start from the fact

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.680
that business intelligence

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.680
is a prediction of the future.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.680
An attempt to find out what will happen.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.680
Will the organization pay its debts?

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.680
Will it fulfill its obligations?

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.680
Or not?

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.680
Therefore, the conclusions are usually not categorical.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.680
Certain terminologies are carried out.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.680
The most likely is the possibility.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.680
If you can calculate the percentage,

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.680
the percentage is calculated.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.680
It is difficult to calculate the percentage.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.680
This is possible when you can apply

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.680
mathematical calculations or statistics.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.680
There is a poll at the elections.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.680
You can say that a certain percentage

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.680
will vote for Ivanov and Ivan Ivanovich.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:47.680
You can make a certain percentage

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.680
based on statistics in an information-analytical note.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.680
If this cannot be done,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.680
then you can use terminologies.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:59.680
This is a gradation of the five-point system.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.680
Very likely, likely, unlikely,

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.680
unlikely.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.680
Again, it depends on how you look at it.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.680
You can look at a bottle half empty

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.680
or a bottle half full.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.680
You can say that Ivanov and Ivan Ivanovich

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.680
will win the elections with a 50% chance.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.680
Petrov and Petrovich will win with a 50% chance.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.680
Therefore, you should be careful

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.680
with conclusions.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.680
It is desirable to do so,

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.680
so that later it is not so shameful

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.680
for the conclusions you have presented.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.680
I will focus on two things.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.680
This is information collection and information analysis.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.680
What are the methods of information collection?

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.680
There are so-called office methods.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.680
They are easy to access.

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.680
What do I include here?

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.680
These are various media

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.680
that can be easily obtained

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.680
by using the information collection

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.680
and information analysis.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.680
I will not go into details.

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.680
I will just show you

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.680
the methods of information collection.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.680
Here is the Internet.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.680
There is a large number of Internet resources

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.680
that can be used for business intelligence.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.680
You can include various books, CD-ROMs,

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.680
databases, etc.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.680
These are the methods that can be used

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.680
for obtaining information without leaving the office.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.680
There is a concept of office hard-to-access methods.

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.680
Office hard-to-access methods.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.680
This is about collecting this information

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:57.680
without leaving the office.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.680
There are certain difficulties

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.680
in obtaining this information.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.680
For example, there are some information arrays

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.680
that are difficult to read.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.680
They are in Chinese.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.680
They can be translated,

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.680
but it requires some effort.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.680
For example, the translator's effort is required.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.680
There can be some closed reports,

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.680
some unpublished collections or reference books, etc.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.680
There are methods that require

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.680
leaving the office.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.680
They are called field methods.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.680
What I mean by field methods

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.680
is various surveys, interviews,

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.680
exhibitions, observations, presentations.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.680
You can come to a research firm,

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.680
observe the company's activities

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.680
for a certain period of time.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.680
You can understand whether this firm is alive or not.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.680
You can understand whether someone leaves the firm

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.680
or not, whether some cars enter the firm

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.680
or not.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.680
You can understand the number of cars

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.680
that leave the firm, etc.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.680
There are so-called operational methods.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.680
What do they imply?

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.680
They imply the implementation of certain

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.680
operational events.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.680
These are events related to certain games.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.680
This is an example of a game

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.680
or a visit to a restaurant

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.680
and to infuse a person with a drink.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:07.680
These are also operational methods.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.680
A meeting of a light chess player

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.680
with the company's secretary

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.680
is also an operational method.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.680
There are so-called expert methods.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.680
Expert methods imply the attraction of experts.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.680
There is a number of organizations

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.680
that provide information resources.

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.680
There are many information companies

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.680
that can collect information

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.680
about a particular organization,

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.680
conduct analysis of the region,

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.680
industry, etc.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.680
I would like to draw your attention

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.680
to the following point.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.680
We have official methods

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.680
of obtaining information

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.680
from state bodies.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.680
Unlike personal data,

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.680
there are official channels

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.680
of obtaining information

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.680
from state bodies by legal entities.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.680
This can be obtained

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.680
from the Tax Service,

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.680
from the Spark information database,

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.680
a professional system

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.680
for analyzing markets and companies.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.680
There is an opportunity

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.680
to obtain official information

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.680
from the Redina State Register

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.680
on real estate.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.680
There is an opportunity

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.680
to obtain official information

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.680
from the Trade and Industry Chamber database.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.680
There are many Internet resources

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.680
for obtaining information

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.680
from the official website

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:14.680
and from the state websites

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.680
and specialized websites

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.680
that provide information

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.680
about a particular organization

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.680
or specific areas of activity.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.680
There are information resources

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.680
in the form of professional databases.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.680
For example,

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.680
there is a company called LexisNexis

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.680
and there is a company called

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.680
Dunton Brandstreet.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.680
These are international databases

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.680
that provide information

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.680
and can be used to obtain information.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.680
There is a professional database

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:59.680
on the Russian market.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.680
There is a company called SINZ,

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.680
Lex, Lines, RIP, Integrum,

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.680
Intralex, Astarte, and many more.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.680
There is a database

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.680
that is not official

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.680
and is presented on the Russian market.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.680
It can be used to obtain information

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.680
about companies that are interested.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.680
It includes manufacturers of goods and services,

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:30.680
statistical reporting,

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.680
labyrinth, customs, press,

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.680
registration room,

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.680
and many more.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.680
At least, it can be used

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.680
as a channel to obtain information.

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.680
Now I will draw an analytical work

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.680
in a few words.

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.680
In general,

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.680
the work of an analytical

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.680
is more complex

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.680
than the work of an information specialist.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.680
It is more difficult

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.680
to find a good analyst

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.680
than a good information specialist.

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.680
Unfortunately,

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.680
there are not many specialists

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.680
in the field of business intelligence

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.680
and it is much more difficult to find one.

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.680
An analytical work is carried out

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.680
in two directions.

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.680
The first one is the work of an analyst

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.680
as a person.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.680
The second one is the work

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.680
of automated analytical systems.

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.680
I am quite calm

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.680
about automated analytical systems

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.680
because they cannot replace

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.680
the analytical mind of a person.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.680
They can work well

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.680
when they are used as a help

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.680
for the work of an analyst.

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:27.680
The basis should be done

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.680
for the work of an analyst,

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.680
but the automated systems

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.680
can handle the processing

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.680
of large amounts of information.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.680
They work very well

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.680
when it is necessary

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.680
to process and track the connections

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.680
between a huge number of information resources.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.680
They work very well

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:57.680
according to the scenarios.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.680
If the system is used in a different region

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.680
or in a different country,

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.680
it will tell you that it is working

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.680
according to the scenario.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.680
Such things are well tracked.

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.680
The disadvantage of automated systems

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.680
is that they do not take into account

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.680
many things that an analyst can take into account

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.680
such as inner feelings, experience,

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.680
voice, intuition, etc.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.680
It is a machine, it works

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.680
according to a certain algorithm.

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.680
Life is more complicated.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.680
It should happen

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.680
according to the automated system.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:45.680
Ivan Ivanovich went to the sauna

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.680
with Petrov and Petrovich

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:51.680
and everything began to go a little differently.

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.680
The disadvantage of automated systems

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:57.680
is that they have a tough result.

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.680
They can estimate some events

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.680
because the automated system

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.680
is a computer, it is a unit of zeros.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.680
As a result, we can say

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.680
that there will be a scenario A,

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.680
or scenario B, or scenario C.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.680
We already put the development scenario

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.680
An analyst can say

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.680
that there will be not the same scenarios,

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.680
but scenarios C or E.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.680
The machine will not be able to do this.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.680
It is a system that works according to the program.

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.680
It will say that there will be either the first,

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.680
second or third scenario.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.680
This is the end of our seminar.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.680
I hope that the information

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.680
that you have learned in this video

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.680
will help you to build an effective

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.680
corporate security system

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.680
and protect yourself from the threats

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.680
that exist in your business.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.680
Thank you.
